1
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:16,160
so hi everyone and welcome to the store
guns hundred pages done work with my

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,630
colleagues said it did sorry so when it
comes to use the navigation on the web

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,369
we all know that possible routes are
used literally everywhere

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,020
and chances are that this is gonna be
passwords are going to stay with us in

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,970
the foreseeable future at least and
together with the security weaknesses

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,879
password here and we all know for
example that users reuse passwords

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,170
passwords can be linked from databases
can begin before East and so forth so

8
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,770
many websites acknowledge the problem
and they started offering indication as

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,730
a solution to enhance the security of
passwords and the typical example of a

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,100
two-factor authentication is where a
user he talkin nowadays that this place

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,809
one time codes and then whenever he
wants to begin to supply besides the

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,730
username and password also they're
currently displayed one time code and

13
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,460
actually this form of the factors
indication is currently the most widely

14
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,240
deployed and used

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:36,820
and the cold can either be read by an
application that is running on your

16
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,298
phone or it can be received through an
SMS message on demand whenever the user

17
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,560
attempts to log in and most if not all a
big companies out there

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,630
already some solution offered a solution
like this

19
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,960
the problem is that the user adoption is
pretty small whenever the treasury is

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,100
optional is emotional and there have
been a couple of studies that show

21
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,690
exactly resend for example a very recent
one from this year you're a sec 2015 so

22
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,220
that only six percent out of 100,000
gmail accounts have to have a enabled

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:23,470
now there is no question is why so why
users don't actually by the refusing to

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:31,130
FA we cannot know for sure I mean there
are many many reasons for that but in

25
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,799
general what we believe is a disability
is a very important factor and if you

26
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:41,690
think about it you just used to entering
the username and password and now this

27
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,769
method that i just described require
users to interact with their phone in

28
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,350
order to transfer service 1 p.m. code
from the phone to the browser from which

29
00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:00,858
they looking and there are already
solutions out there that attempt to

30
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:06,910
reduce the level of interaction with the
phone and for example now the user data

31
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,269
solutions that are usually just needs to
top and bottom on his phone to authorize

32
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:20,010
but see these kinds of solutions require
the user to access tapes and interacting

33
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:28,440
with just phone so they step forward
would be to try to completely come up

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,739
with that completely eliminates the user
interaction so that we can make it will

35
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:36,810
fade

36
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,329
officials are as close as to their way
to the way their users are used to it

37
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:50,260
which is just entering the password if
you think about it the second factor is

38
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,000
the proof that the set of at me as a
user

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,730
now I have access to my iPhone and with
a code based approach to approve it by

40
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:11,170
entering code to the browser going on so
we can say that the simple fact that can

41
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,649
be just the proximity of the user's
phone to the computer from which is

42
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:24,549
currently looking and proximity could be
verified for example by using some local

43
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,340
communication channel between the phone
and the computer to transfer this one

44
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,380
time code or execute whatever protocol
we need to support without requiring the

45
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,580
user to interact with useful I didn't we
could trying to sense the environment

46
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,260
both from the laptop were you there is
no imminent from the device and

47
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,250
determined that the devices are
collocated are in the same involved so

48
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:03,850
let's see what options do with him for
example 49442 computer communication we

49
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,689
could use Bluetooth and there has been

50
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:14,019
work from but 2012 at exactly this and
what they propose using unpaired

51
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:20,129
communication between the computer and
the phone in order to do that with a

52
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:28,339
protocol notice the unpaired the authors
of the paper believes and we agree that

53
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,580
giving the user to pay their fees

54
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,240
his phone with a computer by whenever he
wants to look into it from me from your

55
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,659
device can be usability issues so that's
why they chose to go from there

56
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:47,840
solution not the problem with this
approach is that currently browser's

57
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,810
JavaScript running wheels browse it
within a browser doesn't give way to

58
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,759
talk over the phone to communicate with
this means that for a solution to work

59
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,180
nowadays we need to either modify your
browser or install some additional

60
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,280
software plug-in for example in order to
make it happen so we see that there is a

61
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,460
liability issue which is important
because if people need to do extra steps

62
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,008
in order to make this happen to for
example for a solution to work they need

63
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:27,680
to celebrate this is probably going to
get usable as well an option for them

64
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,240
being with discovery solution we would
use wifi that he's been a baby last year

65
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,199
that proposes using creating a virtual
access point on the laptop and bearing

66
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,569
the laptop and the phone over his wife I
never got the problem again is that they

67
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,330
use administering style extra software
for this to happen

68
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:56,120
/ he needs to go through the setup
procedure every time he wants to looking

69
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,979
for a new device so we also discovered
this solution will get what about the

70
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,139
other way of detecting proximity for
assessing the environment is very

71
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:13,599
straightforward solution that could come
in or he would be to use location-based

72
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,669
process so we could use GPS to verify
that the computer world you mean and our

73
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:24,448
phone is the same location now besides
some security issues that this solution

74
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,669
but I would not go into details

75
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,000
the problem is that currently although
furnace all of them here GPS access to

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,069
GPS which is not the case for commodity
computers laptops and so we also

77
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,020
discussed

78
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,979
now you think about it there is a sense
that might come in can be from what we

79
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:58,469
want to do in this is a microphone was
on smartphones and computers and what is

80
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,069
important here is that JavaScript
enabled in your browser

81
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:11,659
indirectly capture audio from the
microphone using the ABI that some of

82
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:19,169
the major browsers already support so
this brings has to some truth we

83
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:25,198
leverage the microphone on our devices
in order to sense in order to detect

84
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,169
approach to verify the proximity and use
this as a second indication factor also

85
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,390
listens to the blaze it doesn't require
any user interaction and is deployable

86
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,338
because it's compatible with today's
brown smartphones in browsers without

87
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,180
requiring any plugins for additional
software we implemented a prototype on

88
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:50,239
Android and iOS and we used it in order
to evaluate whether also listen actually

89
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,940
works in a variety of environments

90
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,280
and also whether it works for example
when the user's phone is in his pocket

91
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,810
or maybe universe somewhere near in the
room and they will come to the results

92
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:12,239
so just to give you a high-level
overview of how this works

93
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,970
the user enters the password is used in
devices first to be successful in this

94
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:24,630
it will instruct to both the computer
and the phone to start equality they

95
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,689
will record for a certain amount of time
for example three seconds and then both

96
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,350
of them will come up with something know
what happened next is at the computer

97
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,420
sample will be transferred through the
Service or that there is no local

98
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,479
computer communication and all the
communications happens through the

99
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:55,840
server to samples and its task is to
compare them in the computer a

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,200
similarity score S now depending on
weather is above or below a certain

101
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:15,600
predefined threshold reform can inform
on way there is legitimate or not so we

102
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:28,050
got some truth is that I get that he's
somehow already obtained the user's

103
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:34,270
credentials username and password and
she wants to begin as the user on the on

104
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:40,480
the particular server so she submits the
victims were Democrats vote which which

105
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,610
are correct and then there's some
protocol initiates and the both now the

106
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,550
attackers device and the user's phone
stopped recording and their biggest goal

107
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:59,089
is to submit an order something that we
much the sample recorded by the user

108
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:05,730
in other words attacking yes the type of
sound that is currently in that can be

109
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,860
kinda scared at the Vixens environment
at the time of the attack and in a bit

110
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,029
early so you got according to our
empirical results which is actually hard

111
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:24,160
thing to do this however that the
silence or in other words the absence of

112
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,029
noise is something together for example
sleeps and his his phone next to him

113
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,290
there might be a lot of silence in

114
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,300
in the room so we must submit a
similarly silence and tried to pull the

115
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:49,420
system so that's why our system requires
that both submitting samples from the

116
00:11:49,420 --> 00:12:01,250
computer and the phone at a boba certain
silence ok now soundproof so the time

117
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:07,680
that some truth requires some proof
protocol to execute assuming that we

118
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,910
count from the time that the user teach
him the time that the browser eventually

119
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:19,180
refreshes the content and this includes
the recording time which will set you

120
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,790
free s/h experiments so little time
regardless of where the phone was

121
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,730
connected to wi-fi or cellular network
was an average below five seconds

122
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:38,769
although is expected to good cellular
connectivity to was a bit higher I hear

123
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:44,850
that there is quite a few room for
improvement because our program

124
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,279
implementation what he did was due for
example the computer was recording was

125
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,350
recording for the full time of three
seconds and then was a blow the whole

126
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,920
row sample to the phone through the
server but of course we could save on

127
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,930
this network time by compressing or
streaming recording and not waiting

128
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,800
until the recording on the browser

129
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,120
so in order to evaluate our system and
see if it actually works in practice we

130
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,810
are

131
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,560
inexpensive audio collection campaign to
use it as we're performing login

132
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,459
attempts using our prototype over the
course of one month and we tried a

133
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,100
variety of environments for example a
typical office environment an office

134
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,880
environment where music can be heard the
homework TV's own election room at race

135
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,230
pace on record that area we tried
different operating systems so much

136
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,370
windows with rights different phones iOS
and Android with right different

137
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,740
positions for the phone so just being
outside at the table where the user

138
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:04,200
agrees or in his pocket or purse nearby
him and also directly with all that

139
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,880
would be completely silent or could be
talking coughing or wheezing when the

140
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,920
case on this is taking place in total
recording we recorded it and collected

141
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:24,900
approximately 4,000 samples or in other
words 2000 looking at them and we used

142
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,079
to tune our son comparison

143
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,320
algorithm I'm not going to go to jail
because in a way you can talk about how

144
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,040
exactly you the comparison works but to
give you an example we found out that

145
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,349
our algorithm works better when we only
York differences between these two hits

146
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,360
and foreclosures and we describe the
record the rest of the three constructs

147
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,630
but after a week in which one tower the
parameters when we tried to compute

148
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,000
before the election and and false
acceptance rate for different values of

149
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,560
the melodic the score and you can see
section news when illegitimate login is

150
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,180
detected and as you can see is the
threshold threshold increases the

151
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,849
chances are higher as expected for a
legitimate looking to be rejected for

152
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:35,780
the false acceptance rate which is when
a fraudulent login is accepted we tried

153
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:42,610
the following strategy so we had to
users collecting our samples so in order

154
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,250
to compute their false acceptance rate
we took the samples for one user and try

155
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,660
to talk to all the samples and vice
versa

156
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,449
and this year about fifty millions of
over that bears in with this we computed

157
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,210
the false acceptance rate and as you can
see of course is expected as a military

158
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,770
school threshold increases it gets
harder for the attacker to to get the

159
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:12,050
fraudulent looking accepted and go for
the sweet spot where we balance security

160
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,859
and usability

161
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,120
equal error rate was computed want to be
at the school

162
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:27,600
score threshold was 80 points and the
array was 0.2%

163
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,400
see all our collected samples categorize
over the different environments that we

164
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,620
that we tried and we have similar plots
in the paper showing the behavior of a

165
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,490
system for the other variables that we
use for example one position the kind of

166
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,670
laptop were used and so on

167
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:56,660
gray line is this threshold at which
said there's no point and we have four

168
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,490
samples below it

169
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:06,960
which means that we had false for force
Protection's out of the 2010 this is

170
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:19,560
essentially vegetable into percent
result before so we talked about that it

171
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,919
during some of its kind of put them to
guess the environment

172
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:33,870
sound and seat what about collocated I
guess so again we have another guy that

173
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:41,489
knows the victims themselves but now
she's collocated with everything she's a

174
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:48,480
mystery to him about what does sound 16
starts recording and now the chances are

175
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,440
that the samples submitted by the
Italian will be similar to the one

176
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,040
recorded by the user sort in in this
case the attack will succeed not sure of

177
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,190
your track record doesn't have to do
anything because he's just sitting next

178
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,210
to close to the to the victim and his
device can record the same sounds that

179
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:19,050
they use your phone will attack you are
not yet rated by our solution now we

180
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:28,220
argue that ecology Action Centre al
Qaeda to defeat it targeted the package

181
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:36,860
so she wants a particular person and if
you think about it if there is no user

182
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,719
interaction

183
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,720
because if the two have a mechanism
doesn't require the user to interact

184
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,090
with his phone and also the attack you
can try to

185
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,429
use this mechanism if you know the users
themselves without requiring any

186
00:18:52,430 --> 00:19:01,000
interaction with the phone this is an
exception if we acquire that before

187
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,470
using the Twitter brought we require
that the user's phone just to be

188
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,840
particularly bad for example over with
his computer says that the attacker

189
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,350
cannot used his device in order to talk
with the phone and perform better able

190
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,969
to hold the problem with this approach
is that requires this procedure every

191
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:34,670
time they use their hands to form a new
device which kinds of usability of

192
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,850
course if if if approached requires user
defining direction for example the

193
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,540
traditional codebase approach then it's
really gets hurt their particular needs

194
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:51,409
to access the phone into recovery mode
but we argue that determine

195
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:56,350
classifications least a decade of the
victims will eventually find the

196
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,658
opportunity to access

197
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:05,759
so there is a trade-off between security
and usability you can try to make the

198
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,519
situation harder for co-located that I
get to succeed but at the same time you

199
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:20,720
are hurting the usability expert so we
also did a very preliminary study to get

200
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,320
a taste of whether of how the users
received the usability of something so

201
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,960
we recruited 32 participants no security
experts and in a controlled environment

202
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,419
we asked them to evaluate and compare of
the most popular currently deployed to

203
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:51,720
have a mechanism which is Google
verification code base abroad with the

204
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,389
results were that the users the
participants rated the usability of of

205
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,389
soundproof

206
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,728
more highly than done over a Google
verification and according to the

207
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:07,389
feedback that we received boxes which
was mainly due to the fact that some

208
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:12,330
through the sunroof was much faster to
use and also didn't require any user

209
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,590
interaction

210
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,949
apart from that we ask that users
whether they would be willing to use any

211
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:26,630
of the two approaches in real life and
users were significantly more

212
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:34,000
more likely to say that they would you
sound rather than even if they do if a

213
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,730
mechanism was then was optional so to
sum up soundproof is an attempt or I

214
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,550
hope from our party delighted to foster
adoption of 23 on the web so even if we

215
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:58,850
consider to be sleepy last year we have
security and usability and user adoption

216
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:05,469
and the current state with password on
litigation is that we have we will have

217
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,940
a low-security but the usability of the
global they're good I mean you are used

218
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,470
to using passports and there are no
reply believe the problems so the user

219
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:23,280
adoption is kinda everyone is using them
no existing approaches a very good job

220
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,790
increasing significantly the security of
the user authentication on the web but

221
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,480
they do so at the cost of either
usability or deployable or both

222
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,050
increase we believe leads to small user
adoption in other words we believe that

223
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,550
usability and employability is very
highly correlated with the user adoption

224
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,990
so what we've tried to do with
unreleased to balance things out a

225
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:57,240
little bit and offer a solution that is
more secure and admittedly less secure

226
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,800
than some of the existing approaches in
actually the paper that we do

227
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,930
comparisons with the various existing
approaches

228
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,210
in terms of security but with a more
balanced and better user billion

229
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:16,150
globally the aspect in order to foster
adoption of the delivery mechanism and

230
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:24,170
then being able to take advantage of the
increased security that you know feel

231
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:30,650
free to access our website where you can
also see if the bill of some proof in

232
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:39,120
action and we wish him happy to take
your questions

233
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:53,309
audio components shoulders I wonder if
you thought about a couple of items that

234
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,480
may be made to it

235
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,760
one is to have the computer itself
generate some sound so the user may know

236
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,559
this is going on obviously someone in
the same room could see it and if you

237
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,190
think that this a little further there
was a demonstration at USENIX annual

238
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:13,530
technical conference about five years
ago someone who proved that about half

239
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,790
the computers in the world can generate
and listen to ultrasound up to about 25

240
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,190
killer hurts so you might be able to
communicate without even bothering

241
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:31,540
anybody but a nearby dog even sound is
audible spectrum then you might have

242
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,720
problems are you know the user might
feel a bit awkward when the computer is

243
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,280
generating some sound now actually there
are

244
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,910
some solutions for example there is a
company that was recently acquired by

245
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:51,520
Google called the game that they tried
to use as a communication channel

246
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,170
between the computer and the actual to
be honest I'm not exactly sure that

247
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:04,420
works because it's not out there yet but
we could think of some problems besides

248
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,350
the dog issue for example

249
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:13,490
this requires that the user to debate
them soon to give the speakers volume at

250
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,250
this level one is indicated for example
may be in the twenties listening to

251
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,570
music with headphones plugged the
headphone and then you know they're not

252
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,389
the speaker also indicates you know so
it might have some problems regarding to

253
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:36,690
your ability but yes this is an approach
that can be University of Utah so I had

254
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,549
a question about your choice for these
kind of a gold standard for the

255
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:46,309
usability comparison with current
solutions better either SMS or a pace as

256
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,879
opposed to some of the emerging
standards that are looking at also

257
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,659
trained in a sweet spot between
usability and security so for example

258
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:58,210
you didn't do any of the UDF approaches
and I was kind of curious as to your

259
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:05,289
choice of using the app instead we use
the app because it's the most currently

260
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,480
used

261
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,600
a proper roads I mean I believe it's
more or less the same now approaches

262
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,510
like pornos solutions that require no
user interaction we didn't use because

263
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:25,450
anyway these are big would be more or
less the same without solutions but the

264
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,190
solutions are not currently deployed
they might be in the future so we just

265
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,990
texted what is out there compared to our
solution and see if the user's you know

266
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:40,630
like it or you know just agreed that the
automatic and approaches are more

267
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,860
current we more broadly used but you can
and have her some time been able to just

268
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,870
five UTF tokens

269
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,590
better better one touch on line with his
tongue against UTEP universal second

270
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:57,750
factor it's part of the interview you
need to plug in

271
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,090
because some of them actually don't need
to plug and they can just do and I've

272
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,959
seen but they do usually require a touch
i presume by choice so that you can

273
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:21,900
leave it to the development of talked
about at some point and just talking you

274
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,559
know these are my needs to carry next
token

275
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:35,850
performed so then we might expect we
didn't explode now if you have any exams

276
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,730
from you

277
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:44,499
yes the problem is that the user would
be required to take his phone out and do

278
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:51,779
the case of interaction and plus the
fact that the NFC is not as you begin

279
00:27:51,779 --> 00:28:02,419
with but yes we didn't try that so it
seems your truck models sort of assumed

280
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,740
that either the attackers in the same
room and has access to the sound

281
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,330
environment or has no access to the
sound environment during the Super Bowl

282
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,009
in the state of the union

283
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:15,269
there is broadcast sound that's being
sent and that a large number of people

284
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:22,619
are receiving the same environment model
factor that in so we consider these

285
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:28,949
attacks in to YouTube a bit about that
so we thought maybe the attacker can

286
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,809
guess that the user now is listening to
this registration or do this is what's

287
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:41,960
into this right and we performed
experiments on that level what we found

288
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,460
out is that there's a little something
that I didn't talk about our solution

289
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:54,139
when comparing the samples required him
to be synchronized so we have a

290
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:59,529
synchronization protocol that is going
on when they hit with a protocol is

291
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:05,769
executed and let's assume that it's
exactly the same sample is what they

292
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:12,440
call it but after two hundred
milliseconds

293
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,980
will not go through so what we tried to
do with this

294
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,660
broadcast example we tried to record to
perform this attack and we found out

295
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:29,510
that when the channel the correct it
just sounded like it was received

296
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,440
through the same provide there and
within the same city and was very very

297
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,460
small so that the attack but if the
attacker for example was located in

298
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,429
another city or country or was receiving
the same signals through different

299
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:50,679
provider then the synchronization of the
two signals goes sufficient enough for

300
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:57,200
the election of the war so the two guess
you know what the opposite of this

301
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,919
organization was in order to submit the
signal sensing a way that the

302
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,470
synchronization we pretty much know if
they're not but we can talk about the

303
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:16,320
sort of like but yes there is exactly
how many responsibilities trade was

304
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,100
great paper have you looked at
increasing duration so more than three

305
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,830
seconds and and how much does improve
security is in our use case we often do

306
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,678
these things as an escalation wermer
suspicious about its reaction anyway so

307
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:37,140
we don't mind six seven eight seconds
with a small experimental large-scale

308
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:45,890
the more direction was the Cardinals for
the attack to succeed and then when we

309
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:55,390
went below two seconds approximately
when it was quite easy solution where

310
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,410
you know regarding time is not fixed
there is a minimum 1 like something and

311
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,910
then you know depending on the country
on the accurate on the confidence of the

312
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,630
system

313
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:14,630
you might require a somewhat more time
to record in order to gain alright let's

314
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,340
hang Nikos
