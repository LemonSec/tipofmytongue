1
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,330
that's what interaction and

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,320
let me talk about walked

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,900
that being on emerging tech sector my
name is finally and this is a joint walk

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:30,650
with Chinese all and to all my advisers
has a game and that this is an area that

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,489
ability to transfer over years in
Microsoft products and you can find some

6
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:41,010
of the interesting Palace first double
the number of suspects overflows it is

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,379
decreasing so you know this number
unstable flow is pretty across given a

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,849
very and too many Ltd security
researchers have tried to identify the

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,620
still photos and we know there is a lot
of their own print production techniques

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,669
to stop this table so we believe that is
the reason why did this number of

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,099
America T has been decreasing but you
can see another pattern is this yellow

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,490
bar the use of two free and it is ever
ever increasing and we tried to stop

13
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,369
this use after free in our previous work
and just as India and assess and in this

14
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,100
work we have enough focus on another
matter which is called bad casting or

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,750
also called

16
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,890
countries so people I get into the
details of the casting let me talk about

17
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,729
the two different types hustings in
support so says steady casting or denim

18
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,670
testing testing is this century

19
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,310
convergence and it is fast because there
is no extra pair of kitchens in on time

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,640
but because this telecast on Iran
carries out there some part-time threat

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,530
of patients it has no information on the
extra period

22
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,829
hypes in on time but on the other hand

23
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:06,860
anacostia century a runtime plug
convergence long-time convergence and it

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,229
departed on time

25
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,489
type information which is called that a
TTI and I'm based on this idea why it is

26
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,390
doing the extracted patients in one pipe
so it is in the wrong time based on this

27
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,988
instrument tiered

28
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,579
information it is following it to you
and then get the MDD added to the the

29
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,060
the precise identification so

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,940
it is going to do is complicated
arbitration process it has to be pretty

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,800
slow so because this is a pretty slow
destiny casting is typically prohibited

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,200
in polymers critical applications like
broad like popular bloggers like

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,799
chromium or finals and depending on the
direction I mean depending on how the

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,700
casting is attracted so there is two
different castings casting or tongue

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,859
casting I think you may have about this
from this approach focuses

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:07,400
casting is that DMD casting from a
top-class to casting is the only other

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,530
way around so you can form a parent
class to one of his delight so for

38
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,970
example you can say there's two
different classes and here

39
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,180
element is the parent class and the
other two crosses the tried and it

40
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,860
reaches to specific implementation of
the general implementation element and

41
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,940
you can stay if you go up to this class
hierarchy let me say this is up testing

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,900
and if you go down then we say it is
targeting but she really doing these

43
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,320
types of operations

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,459
the rule of thumb is that are casting is
always in terms of the safety or in

45
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,209
terms of tears tears during the
specification but the problem is down

46
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,069
case thing is not always so let me get
into details of why don't testing can be

47
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:05,530
on state so to understand this let's
consider two different simple classes

48
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,120
that I come up with Andy developed want
you to class P which is the parent class

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,100
and Dwight 152 like Class D car which is
little I formed apparent custody so far

50
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,150
more positive classes

51
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,580
it has to you for sure for charity
structures meaning that appears our

52
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,200
classes so and possible them will have
to approach a function table point

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,520
inside of the opposite and each of them
has its own dedicated is a member

54
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,889
variable and on the school P and on the
understudy

55
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:43,099
so let's see how the each of these costs
will be represented in the memory so

56
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,560
first of all for the panel the first
class P

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,849
filled up with departure from Table
point again because this is political

58
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:58,139
class so it has to know some way to to
resolve is on Fort remembers and a

59
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,389
second one it has its own dedicated
member integer and underscore p but if

60
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,680
you look at it like the class T then did
you first slide is again under to

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,830
function table

62
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,609
point for Japan 24 points and a second
one because this is delighted to form

63
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,310
because this is the life form dependent
class P so it is inheriting p.m. on the

64
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,060
school P from the dependent class and
after that it has is a member variable

65
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,550
amounts under sporting so now we
understand how this memory is

66
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:40,089
represented in the memory but so so
finally the casting is made and in how

67
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,860
did some testing can be actually better
so here in discussing you can see the

68
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,330
classes are located

69
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,919
did memory is allocated into a crusty
and every tried to downtown into the

70
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,049
delight class but the problem is that
this is actually been testing because

71
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,669
to be casting cost d is not really a
subset of people so indeed I'm C++

72
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:09,969
tender kisses called undefined behavior
meaning that the compiler cannot

73
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:16,370
guarantee the correctness of the program
after display and more critically what's

74
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,289
going to happen is that this can also
involved in corruption problem and if

75
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,469
you try to draft friends despite esta
point and then there can be a member of

76
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:30,479
corruption so for example let's go back
to the same customer layout for the

77
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,568
Kospi and if you try to do a France des
p

78
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:42,680
the middle school D if you try to to try
to access to this day remember that it

79
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,060
is actually trying to access something
which is not really look at it by

80
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,860
yourself so what's gonna happen this is
america

81
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,689
option so you can try something and this
can be ready to cross corrupt acts like

82
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,810
a lot of the option of tax you can
delight to control full control

83
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,979
especially if you override some pointers
and you can only do they are pretty much

84
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:13,419
the same attack here than during lunch
DMD arbitrary code execution but

85
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,169
actually understand how do you spell
casting really happens into practice so

86
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:23,549
we took the examples from the one of the
better for their views from and which is

87
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,029
also used in Pakistan contest in 2030 so
this is a very high road cases involving

88
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:36,580
dispatch casting and the first class was
allocated into the HTML unknown element

89
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,969
and after that it is up to us to the
element which is the generic

90
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:45,529
implementation of the HTML unknown
element and then after that it was

91
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:51,650
trying to do the don't casting into the
SVG element so it is going back to the

92
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,099
specific implementation so white the
wider problem why is this problem

93
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:04,599
because this HTML on the size forty HTML
element is on the 96 bytes but untested

94
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,669
cos it has WAY bigger size wants to know
what I'm trying to say is there once you

95
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:16,750
get down and once you have this as a
video game and then you have the extra

96
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,289
visibility of the memory like 64 bytes
so using this sixty-four bison the

97
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,520
attacker went over like didi memories
which is not really located or which is

98
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,878
dedicated to someone else so what you
can do is tell you can still write

99
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,990
departure from employers or something
like that to hijack the control flow or

100
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:43,390
you can mobilize some data in the memory
and a more importantly if you look at

101
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,810
the empty complete picture of the class
hierarchy involving death involving this

102
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,579
problem and you can see it is pretty
pretty complicated so you can see this

103
00:08:53,579 --> 00:09:02,719
agreement had the defeat 27 difference
between classes and complex crest

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,079
case it'll be very very hard to fault
about person to have very very good

105
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,758
understandings on the day when you're
doing the customer that means cutting

106
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,310
operation can be pretty airport so we
are not really first to talk about this

107
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,300
Pakistan problem there was a distinct
solution but each of them had a

108
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:33,810
challenges so debating approach is this
region is to replace still casting into

109
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,839
dynamic but the AM because he died on
the way to animal testing walks it has a

110
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,269
problem when it is hindering pandering
deal more classes to obligated to reader

111
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:49,360
but let me talk about the MTQ cases and
Wendy dynamic casting is a hundred

112
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,839
diplomatic crisis so weighty RTT are so
tiny casting Ashley Wilson the point

113
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,610
where license and a given the point if
it tried to exit 22 CDM did you first

114
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,600
slot of the Olympic us then again most
likely that is for sure function table

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,939
pointer and if you follow up the
structure then you end up with the

116
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:16,879
custom and the based on this across the
street name you can actually use it for

117
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,589
the young Thai partition so this is
something the average listing solution

118
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:27,959
was doing but the problem happens to me
was when it is trying to handle so if

119
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,170
the time casting what's going to happen
is that we don't have we don't have the

120
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,128
assumption we don't have any move we
don't really have a solution sure now

121
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,750
that the answers to slightly less
fortunate people it can be any arbitrary

122
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,009
day remember type system which is
defined by developer self care about

123
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:53,519
myself and if we are trying to traverse
this variable than it can be to the

124
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,250
runtime crash and this is something
related to the two disciplines problem I

125
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,329
mean so like C++ opposed no reliable
method to resolve whether a pointer

126
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:09,290
points to pull within one point of the
classes

127
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,319
and because of these problems because
this country children from classes don't

128
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,540
think flashes

129
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,189
previous solutions including undefined
behavior sanitizer

130
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,589
relies on the blacklisting meaning that
based on the trial and error process you

131
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:33,029
try to identify this sort of the classes
I mean then after that you opt to apply

132
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:41,459
your solution onto these cases so to
overcome this limitation we come up with

133
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:47,959
the labor which recalled paper which is
showed forecast severe fire and this is

134
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:54,109
a test in addition to so we have to
design clothes first we try to come up

135
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,540
with a 3.2 so that it is not really
relying on the blacklisting so that we

136
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,730
can easily apply it to the commodity
software like office and we want to have

137
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,269
the original on time performances so
that it can happen apparently cases in

138
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,149
the future

139
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:20,370
overview the first of all it takes the
source code yes this is Decatur is

140
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,810
relying on a social level and entering
the confirmation page compliation fate

141
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:31,550
are we first see each table which is to
type of heart table holding the

142
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,199
relationship information and after that
we also do the instrumentation which

143
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:48,079
follows 25 information in on time and
after that at all during during which we

144
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,000
added up the cable on time and then
finally we generate the security

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,199
security executable so here's the
technique of paper so you can see first

146
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:08,508
to relocate to class and sheared so the
ps2 located costs and we are trying to

147
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:15,480
cast it into the into plastic so what's
gonna happen if you're given this point

148
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,360
and in this pointer is pointing to in
some hot sex and in one time you don't

149
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,800
really

150
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,490
do what kind of what kind of class the
PTR points so it is just so to actually

151
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,130
understand to actually identify this
person but casting

152
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,580
paper has to answer following two
catches the first question we have is

153
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,709
that I wanted to class relationships
between PND andresr discussion in using

154
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:48,959
the hour on you type marketable we
called each table and based on TTH table

155
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,680
can understand the whole class
relationships the next question we have

156
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,510
is that what kind of the East Point
points two fewer to in general on what

157
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,140
it means is that given the human
deployment in on time

158
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,240
what kind of classes so we come up with
a new runtime tracing technique so that

159
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,880
it doesn't really have the problems from
the classes but we cannot we can

160
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:25,950
generally hundred posed to both of these
two cases i party table at each table

161
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:32,709
includes a set of already done with
classes to be converted and sheer to

162
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,869
class names i has shit for Best
Companies in and hierarchies are in

163
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,529
order to avoid travel so what I mean by
here you can see it two different

164
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:48,800
classes so again he was derived class
copy and you can see because he should

165
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,899
be able to cast includes himself for the
day because the parent classes PCP

166
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:01,660
includes to TMP and the other point is
the instead of storing the artistry

167
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,800
itself we always restore the hash hash
industry so that we can avoid the

168
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:16,510
expensive syncopation second we try to
annul the disorderly out early so that

169
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,899
the cable systems over and then try to
understand our world did you cuss

170
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,730
relationships for certain costs

171
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,329
and after that we also that he had a
long time practicing scientists runtime

172
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,719
tracing food there's not time to
increasing the instrumentation the

173
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,010
actual trace what the streets function
is doing is that once the object is

174
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,740
located then you will see again the
pointer is so what we're doing in the

175
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,260
district's function first creating
metadata and dismayed I'd data is

176
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:58,260
pointing to the kids table and we
maintain a D hidden in time being from

177
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,790
object metadata as though depending on
the allocation scheme we have used a

178
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,790
different era soldiers and emotionally
kathleen was cheerful come up with the

179
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,079
luxury data structures under the
Treasury Department's so far this year

180
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:19,079
we are using alignment based attract
mapping and a force that exact Eugene

181
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,540
threat or a person process red-black
trees and the important feature here

182
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,880
that we want to emphasize is that this
is decoupling the metadata from the

183
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,980
office and please remember that the form
the autonomy casting or articulate my

184
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,569
own place to tools they were actually
putting the metadata inside of the

185
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:46,139
infected their new not really putting
the did not really pretty but itself was

186
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,990
already inside the office so if she
wants to try to make some assumptions on

187
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,110
there and they end up with the crash but
because we completely decoupled and

188
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:04,410
separated separate this out so we don't
have such trash problems

189
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:12,380
so finally we do develop kitchen custom
here is to give industry casting onto

190
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,420
the crusty then how do it with the
complete verification

191
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,190
so again thank strategic table and
turnaround time practicing we will have

192
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:28,050
this memory layout and what this
verification is doing is to simply going

193
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:33,480
over to state of structure and to see
rather disgusting is buried one not the

194
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,380
first what we do given the point we try
to locate a metadata associated with the

195
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:47,340
object and after that we'll look at the
associated to each table and finally to

196
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,110
teach table and check if this
destination costs more to be Catholic

197
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,370
crusty

198
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:59,560
in the table and in this example because
each table P does not really include

199
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:07,990
across T then we can determine that this
is a podcast so we also the day several

200
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,020
optimizations for keeper the first one
is standard we did the selected object

201
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,180
racing and because share pictures not
all objects are involved in targeting

202
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:25,080
will try to statically identify such
jobs and skip tracing them we also try

203
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,899
to use the verification result and
because the verification process has to

204
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,690
be always the same for same classes so
we try to use we try to cash in this

205
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:43,080
result to be used in the future and we
have implemented paper based on the

206
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,419
Arabian composite and we have added more
than three thousand lines of citrus

207
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:55,810
post-cold and currently we support Linux
x86 64 bit and caper can be activated

208
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:03,500
with one extra Kampala slick and in
devaluation we tried to answer for

209
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,360
winter classes first question which
first question how much force required

210
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,949
to deploy Trevor second how effective in
detecting PAT testing

211
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:22,980
their bodies to overrun time overheard
of keeper first of all Department

212
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,139
reports and we we tried to bill the
chromium Firefox browsers using Decatur

213
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:34,799
and to do that we change it appeared to
configuration files of each of this

214
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,830
process and we exchanged added 21 and
tan lines of confrontation was 34

215
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:47,559
switching the compiler default compiler
GCC in 211 compiler error and during

216
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,830
this phase we have used to know
blackness and after that we found that

217
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,330
caver was successfully both partners and
it was able to run for sponsors without

218
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:05,360
one-time prices and kisses to one of the
running example paper so you can see you

219
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,750
once but casting is detected favored
generally just sort of the report and

220
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,860
you can see first day it is showing the
tutor to casting information so from the

221
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,219
house is located first and second is 2.0
information and third it is the

222
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,350
destination or to be kathy Castor and
Tessa showing a long time course that so

223
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,549
that they developed for 2013 he
identifies the podcasting they will have

224
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:38,429
a better understanding so on what's
really going on in this broadcast and

225
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:45,750
cable found in Ariz as a drinky
variation became a discovered 1102 cases

226
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,669
in five holes and we on the Bach party
or worse from them and ninety-six in the

227
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:57,870
new standard C++ and all of this on Nov
areas have been reported to the vendors

228
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:05,510
and face five entrances and she just
roll on time overhead so right now the

229
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:11,158
paper has run time over house are
complete depending on the application

230
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:19,200
characteristics and on average we have
7.6% over had an unfaithful we have

231
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,220
64.6% over has

232
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,320
and you may wonder what are the
applications of the caper and installing

233
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,149
you can easily imagine that this can be
used as a multi-touch into and we have

234
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,960
already have shown that it was easy to
find eleven different areas in Pakistan

235
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,610
so indeedy enterprise studying using
some backend server if the cables

236
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,149
running then hopefully you can find more
posts in the future but if you're trying

237
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:58,890
to post a restaurant and communication
to forget about the

238
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,750
over had a really posing as
communication to this has some

239
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,610
interesting interesting research it
fresh and so I think so because did

240
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,668
think about you alot of the previous
mitigation techniques we are really

241
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:19,760
think about your relating about and many
of these techniques are focusing on the

242
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,020
sort of Damascus to think about the CFI
or are people mentioned techniques it is

243
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,320
relying on some certain assumptions on
how the attacker created experts so yes

244
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,700
I assuming that given the memory
corruption but the overriding the

245
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,169
country for data and ROP attack so they
even did a controversial hijacking a

246
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:46,830
very controversial hijack capability
they are changing the different judges

247
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,949
but it is always possible that your
topic comes up with a different time and

248
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,960
a rear right that's why we're singing a
different research papers talking about

249
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,400
how do you see if I can be broken or how
this Fri has some limitations in the

250
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,840
implementation and also more importantly
it is known that most of the hour test

251
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,480
researchers were talking about the
controversial tax meaning that it is

252
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,850
hijacked in the country but once the
attackers switch it into the country

253
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:25,350
their attack meaning that using some
sandbox there was something

254
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:34,020
and irrigation techniques will not be
effective as people but here we want to

255
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,700
emphasize that paper tackles the root
cause of the best casting so instead of

256
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,809
focusing on the how the ass played or
how the attack is made but we are

257
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:48,340
focusing on the little cost so that it
took so that so that's why the cave is

258
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:55,959
often mistake to certain exploitation
matter which is the conclusion we

259
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:03,100
propose to keep you on time Pakistan to
and cable was able to discover about

260
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:10,070
casting their various in fact dogs and
they are standard and we have a very

261
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:20,260
short so here's what I'm going to do I'm
gonna run the chromium browser and this

262
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:27,590
is the version that we haven't mentioned
about their exploits that PCB 2014

263
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,539
something and then we're going to do is
that gonna run the browser and then to

264
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:36,960
very very simple stop and then tried to
visit the division exploitation paste

265
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,260
and I will show you gonna happen so let
me know and I hope the internet

266
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:52,640
yesterday which is so hardened by armed
paper it is already instrumental version

267
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,900
so it looks pretty transparent you can
see actually in the back and it is

268
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:04,220
tracing a lot of the object location and
verifying

269
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:10,549
I can search for something here you can
see there is no prospect for suppose but

270
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:20,039
it is doing something and if I try to
visit the application for exportation

271
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:55,100
site

272
00:25:55,100 --> 00:27:07,840
thank you very much

273
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:32,428
from one position is declared the
mapping between the object so the

274
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:36,200
question is remapped each table with the
object

275
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,190
usually when you knew like in the usual
Erdei USD the type in line right in the

276
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,529
objects so if you meant copy it
somewhere else you still have that

277
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:50,440
information but if you keep our global
mopping outline from you then you lose

278
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:58,390
the kitchen but we haven't really seen I
think we need to check the details but

279
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:58,799
I'm

280
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,559
this is a C++ console and I don't think
you can do the memory copy I think you

281
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,820
can area yes

282
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,820
instrument email copy but we can handle
that problem as well as an extra week

283
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,889
and Emmanuel

284
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:24,039
sometime in our reach so I discipline
and I think I need to think it through

285
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:32,629
but I don't think you can do you cannot
really like that right there has to be

286
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:39,789
copy constructor or something

287
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,749
if you do a size of the object you you
actually know its object east side so

288
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:53,720
you can just get my particular MIT
Lincoln Laboratory

289
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,359
what's the advantage of this system
overusing something where you say

290
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:05,029
replace all of the polymorphic static
casts with dynamic casts and then just

291
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:08,570
put in a certain afterwards like what's
what's the advantage of you your system

292
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,450
over that if you simply try to replace

293
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,149
instead casting into dynamic testing
haven't really mentioned that you tell

294
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:25,289
us about it is easy to do is to you need
to enable TTI and easy challenge and an

295
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:31,739
extra challenges 30 MTG fundamental
challenges here is that the point and so

296
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:36,049
for some of the tiny casting so some of
the static testing is purely designed

297
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:44,509
for or used for dinner but if you want
to switch into dynamic testing then was

298
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:50,200
gonna have to switch international
texting you have to assume that this is

299
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,999
the point at which you are trying to
cast is pointing to the US and you're

300
00:29:55,999 --> 00:30:01,309
also making the assumption that
terrorists such a function table should

301
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:05,320
be able to tell statically whether there
is a virtual function table pointer in a

302
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,289
classical near places dynamic as I don't
think it's a shame but I don't think you

303
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:16,309
can do that so I did it is complicated
plus iraqi I think about is a basic

304
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:25,479
classes cost and after that you have to
put us at some point you have to Cherry

305
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:31,940
Point which is still you have some point
and based on that if you're trying to

306
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:42,940
recast into deployment clasp thanks

307
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,990
all right thank you
