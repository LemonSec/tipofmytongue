1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,430
you very much thank you angels for that
nice entry

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,530
visor view truncated

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,770
the speaker had preceded me when I came
a little early and saw the new and very

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,490
wisely given out the best speaker one
before I spoke shows very good judgment

5
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,200
Angeles mentioned that he'd sort of
truncated my career

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,550
description of my career maybe this
event likely truncate the career itself

7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,589
I actually among other things was a law
professor and I remember having a strong

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,940
sense about my teaching qualities when a
student came up to me at the end of one

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,420
of the classes and gushing with
enthusiasms professor dancing I just

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,460
don't know how you do it you're every
lecture is better than the next one

11
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,879
I thought about that for a while and
decided to quit teaching and it led me

12
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,820
eventually into government were among
other things I became secretary of the

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:15,210
Navy and I was he once I thought
effectively but admittedly at some

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,100
length when a marine got up to leave and
that didn't seem to me to be

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,658
appropriately compatible with the
dignity of the secretary of the Navy so

16
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,530
I stopped him and asked him where he was
going

17
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,380
didn't think the dignity of the
secretary of the Navy was enhanced by

18
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,550
his answer which was that he was going
to get a haircut so I said to him what

19
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,070
did you get a haircut before I began
speaking and he said I didn't need one

20
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,960
so these factors also just to me were
very wise to give out the award long

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,110
before I spoke but I think you for the
opportunity I'm going to try and do

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:03,340
something difficult here and that is to
provide sort of bridge between the

23
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,070
technology world that you all know so
well and the Washington policymaker

24
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,750
world that you're now physically
embedded in but also functionally so

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,930
embedded in as we talk about
cybersecurity issues and the challenge

26
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,000
in some respects is to talk between the
two worlds and not only to talk in a way

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,250
that descriptive and analytic but also
that is prescriptive and suggestive

28
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,390
as angel said the straws in some measure
on a paper that I published this last

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,390
you're in this concept of living on a
diet of poison prude this is the

30
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,880
organization's site you can download
from the web if you like you want to

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,060
follow up on some details I'm going to
go further than the paper today but some

32
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,490
trunk of the footnotes and the like in
that document will give you a richer

33
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,470
background if you want to pursue it
further

34
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:09,030
what I'd like to do today is to give you
a sense of the the world as I see it in

35
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,830
terms of particularly admiring the
problem first I'm gonna spend a little

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,200
bit of time just emphasizing the
character what we're having to deal with

37
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,609
but then I'm going to try and go deeper
and analyze it and by analyzing it I

38
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,190
means trying to point out some of the
key things that underlie the world as we

39
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,420
see in an abstract beyond perhaps kind
of everyday concepts that you deal with

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,130
just some basic propositions are gonna
give you about a half-dozen about why

41
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,880
we're in this situation we're in and
then I'm going to try and move to a

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,640
short description welder terrain that I
think would be more familiar to you

43
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,859
which is just come some of the kinds of
things we're trying to do about it

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,790
what I want to get to particularly as a
set of recommendations and I'm not going

45
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,010
to tend to be comprehensive in those
recommendations I'd want rather the

46
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,130
suggestion by and large things that are
new things that we're not doing that are

47
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,989
not so much

48
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,220
gender not that I've discovered some
incredible curative unknown to the world

49
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,150
but I think there are things to be said
about about this that are not enough on

50
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,399
our agendas it first so let me start
play as I say admiring the problem

51
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,729
a common phrase used these days is the
notion that this is a wicked problem

52
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:31,520
that by which is meant that it's highly
interactive has a number of different

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,529
components and these different
components create difficulties

54
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:43,799
in or actions because in fact different
parts of the problem can't resolve it

55
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:49,159
without connecting with other parts so
technology for example interacts with

56
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:54,389
legal systems and I've shown you just a
little sort of wheel of concerns here

57
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,749
I'd particularly emphasized that we have
to be concerned obviously with business

58
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,309
realities

59
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:07,459
it's great to provide patches or maybe
it's not so great but it's something to

60
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:13,399
provide patches on systems that I've
known vulnerabilities but when you

61
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,619
actually look about why it is that
people don't download those patches the

62
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:24,479
reasons or highly cultural and relate to
business imperatives it may seem like

63
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,959
well this is just a failure and then I
ought to be able to drive people towards

64
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:34,559
but the underlying business reality is
that because they're integrating new

65
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,179
software in two systems that are highly
complex because some of these systems

66
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:44,679
aren't being shut down on anything like
the kind of frequency that would provide

67
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:50,308
immediate response stores will implement
a few are big chain of stores

68
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:54,360
a few stores at a time and then move on
to other stores and so you're always

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,659
having some parts of their system
lagging considerably in the patching or

70
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,929
power company will have an annual shut
down for maintenance and as far as

71
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,020
they're concerned that's the occasion
for updating

72
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,159
the idea of updating more frequently as
one that they can comprehend but not

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,319
readily integrate into their business
model so you find that problems like

74
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,300
this occur with some real frequency
they're also just the kinds of cultural

75
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,180
problems in organizations I remember
talking with the chief information

76
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,460
security officer for one of the really
brand-name companies about his

77
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,888
difficulties he said every rule you come
up with even the most obvious

78
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,580
immediately people ask for exceptions I
said to him well give me an example he

79
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,990
said well are you sure it decree that
says never tell anyone your password

80
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,840
don't share your password with anyone
what could be more basic said to me he

81
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,750
said immediately the CEO tells me of
course you sharing his password with his

82
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,560
assistant how else can hear she get into
the emails so if you're gonna have some

83
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,580
theory of change here you're going to
have to take account of these kinds of

84
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,039
variables I think another aspect of
admiring problem is simply the speed of

85
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,750
change very difficult i think for the
layman to cope with maybe even for you

86
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,080
all is well and the example I used in
the washington national security

87
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,690
establishment to kind of bring this home
is the basic point about the historical

88
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,650
a bit and historical analog think about
the introduction of gunpowder for a

89
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,880
minute into your up circa 1300

90
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,580
that's something that over time

91
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,300
radically changes the character all
warfare which is a central concern of

92
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,509
mine but the characters well of the
state and of the economy now suddenly in

93
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:57,680
the warfare context or notions of
defense as for example building castle

94
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,409
walls with her straight have to be
abandoned or notions of chivalry and

95
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,289
leadership change dramatically

96
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,759
because if I stand in front of the army
waving my sword I'm gonna be shot dead

97
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,499
or notions of organizations of military
strange because now I need mask for

98
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:20,559
firepower and I need the ability to
bring my troops into a state of training

99
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:25,699
that's way more sophisticated than if I
simply reads all performers to be a kind

100
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,369
of policy to go deal with something for
a few weeks so I begin to require

101
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:34,169
standing armies with trained officers
who even understand something about

102
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,588
ballistics and the like and then the
state changes because I need to have in

103
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:45,880
the state or a capability for sustaining
these armies which brings me to taxation

104
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,639
and the like and I also need a munitions
industry because i dont have a munitions

105
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,500
industry I'm gonna lose in any future
kind of combat so everything changes the

106
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,680
nature of warfare the nature of the
economy the nature of the state my

107
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,979
observation is pretty simple one which
is the the coming in the information age

108
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,069
is not less significant than the coming
of gunpowder but all the changes that

109
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:13,990
are just described you take place

110
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,440
essentially over the course of two
centuries and all the changes that we've

111
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,899
experienced by and large major changes
in the information world record over two

112
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:29,920
decades so the speed of assimilation is
just very very difficult for policy

113
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,969
makers and others and Harrington a
government official put it nicely to me

114
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,569
when we're talking about this and I made
the point of just described she said

115
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:42,389
yeah the problem is that the technology
changes at the speed of Moore's Law and

116
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,930
the people don't know what's in our
heads doesn't change that fast we have

117
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,500
all kinds of legacy systems operating in
this contact so you see the dramatic

118
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,690
changes that we've experienced up till
now I'm gonna say a little bit about the

119
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:05,250
the future shortly but what I'd like to
particularly emphasized is that this is

120
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:13,010
a famous quote from well-known computer
scientist william Faulkner who said the

121
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,090
past is not dead it's not even passed to
have to explain this folder reference to

122
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:24,820
the soldiers not sure we have these
overlaps these could continuities from

123
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:32,540
the the world that has passed and that
remain embedded in our systems and give

124
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,990
us fundamental problems you may give you
one example from the national security

125
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,970
world that may be a little subtle and
almost relieved but perhaps beyond your

126
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,500
experience I think its importance in the
way government officials think about

127
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,910
digital information systems that by and
large they were in the works here

128
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,199
context thought of originally and our
biggest development of them in the

129
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,340
context of espionage intelligence the
National Security Agency NSA is

130
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,880
obviously the leading reno of
capabilities in this regard for us it's

131
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,220
striking when you think about the
national security world that it has some

132
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,900
kind of implicit norms in the cold war
spilling into more numerical help me

133
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:27,069
think this out in the cold war we
basically didn't interact in direct

134
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,900
conflict way with the Soviet Union
whenever possible we avoided that the

135
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,110
battlefield involved various proxies
think about the Vietnam War cuba other

136
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,150
issues like that but by and large we
didn't have direct confrontation in

137
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,510
there was some sense of rules of the
road and have restrained at the same

138
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,089
time in the espionage world by and large
all bets were off we don't go out

139
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:55,580
assassinating each other's chiefs of
station intelligence officers in each

140
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,880
other's capitals and the like but if you
could do something then that something

141
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,550
by way of discovering intelligence and
the like

142
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,849
directly involved confrontation and
competition comes now the cyber world

143
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,580
and the basic attitude I think became
all bets are off its unrestricted we

144
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,460
don't have these kinds of restraints as
another example if you use a weapon in

145
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,930
DoD you want to introduce a weapon is a
whole elaborate legal analysis almost

146
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,439
invisible to the outside world that says
this weapon consistent with the laws of

147
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,060
war but what happens in those cyber
world is that this same tools that you

148
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,479
were used to and did you would use for
espionage and intelligence gathering can

149
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,540
also be used for offensive purposes on
the battlefield those tools are in fact

150
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,410
treated as though they were simply
information gathering tools and we don't

151
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,270
have the kind of legal structure around
the more the conceptual structure around

152
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,020
that we have for other things and that's
one of the reasons I think that the

153
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,000
government is struggling with the
reaction to the Office of Personnel

154
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,630
Management Act that you're seeing
because the general historical attitude

155
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,460
has been through two kinds of things
there's warfare and there's espionage

156
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,830
but as you know the cyber straddles both
of them and when they straddle both of

157
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,260
them

158
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,130
it creates complications and so we have
historic ways of thinking that while the

159
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,230
world is so rapidly changing those
historic ways of thinking or

160
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,240
handicapping or limiting us we have this
kind of compartmentalization and no

161
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,800
longer no longer works out we don't have
these kinds of understandings of

162
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,910
distinctions between offense and defense
that we used to have they no longer into

163
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,560
work and another example is in the
notion of well private sector is

164
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,060
different from public sector we used to
think about warfare only in the public

165
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,369
sector kind of context what happens when
you buy public sector mean

166
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,450
moment what happens when you begin to
think more freely will I want to take

167
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,790
you back a little bit and just give you
a little excerpt from my Chinese

168
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,120
document written at the end of the
twentieth century unpublished a piece in

169
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,450
the New York Times in 1998 doing what
every Pentagon official thinks is the

170
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,160
most fundamental and wonderful and
important thing to do which was

171
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,480
introduced to new acronym

172
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,120
and I was very proud of it my new
acronym I thought was very cleverly

173
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,839
designed it was called new the acronym
itself neww and it stood for non

174
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,730
explosive warfare and the notion was
that there are a lot of things cyber

175
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,700
biology etcetera that are coming that
really are weapons that don't go back

176
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,200
that don't explode in the technical
praise or not genetic

177
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,460
this head I think absolutely
characteristic success for me which is

178
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:05,120
to say nobody talks about it but I
nonetheless want to try and revive it by

179
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,790
reviewing it here a long time these two
Chinese kernels in 1999 and they can

180
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,459
advance the notion of unrestricted
warfare which you can read right up here

181
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:21,699
are the basic notion was that we're
coming into an era of technological by

182
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,680
LEDs that there is no distinction
between the battlefield and that the new

183
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,520
concepts which are hopefully reading of
this screen the new concepts enable us

184
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,410
to do a new kind of warfare and they had
the then went on to talk about all the

185
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,890
new concept weapons we're not trying to
kill and destroy some watchers were

186
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:55,769
trying to control remember this is 1999

187
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,759
as we see it as a single stock market
crash a single computer virus can affect

188
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,970
these kinds of new concepts and what
we're trying to do to achieve victory is

189
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,790
to control not to kill we're entering an
era of political economic and

190
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,299
technological minor islands some warning
people will wait to discover was

191
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,129
surprised quite a few gentle and things
have begun to have offensive and needle

192
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,649
characteristics

193
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,600
well you in the light of experience the
last decade will not be surprised at

194
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,929
this you you know these things we've
lived them we see it in the world of

195
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,738
business where we're dealing with things
like I T theft and the kinds of

196
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:45,970
difficulties that I've sketch draw here
you see it as well in in individual

197
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:53,040
lives and not only the negatives but
also have the positives are intertwined

198
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,639
with the negatives are sharing of data
and the light on and we're seeing it in

199
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,609
general in the context of the new where
warfare that I've suggested to so where

200
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:11,059
we goin in regards to this I don't know
I don't think you know I published a

201
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,470
paper few years ago called driving in
the dark which got some attention

202
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,740
because the gist of the argument as some
others are made for example Nicholas has

203
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,609
been we can't see its complex evolution
of the complex future the emerging

204
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:32,379
realities are going to be challenging
for us because in fact our headlights

205
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,409
only go so far and if you look at the
predictions historically they're not

206
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:42,440
very valuable if you go back to 1990 and
you look at predictions about how

207
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,380
technology change will impact national
security the most striking thing to me

208
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,870
is the paucity of attention to the
Internet the internets there is you know

209
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,320
comes out of DARPA starting in the
seventies becomes relatively robust in

210
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,510
the

211
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:05,870
the eighties it's all there but we don't
see except in retrospect there's a

212
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,560
wonderful book called everything is
obvious once you know the answer in

213
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,520
retrospect we can see all this one in
Prospect were not good predictors and we

214
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,710
need to recognize that because it's
extremely relevant to the world that

215
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,480
we're dealing with here

216
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,250
the fact is I can point to the fact that
I know something about the pace of

217
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,300
technology change I know that that
transition into gunpowder will continue

218
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,110
whenever accelerating kinds of ways and
I know there's a huge variety of actions

219
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,909
and of actors out there that will occur
in that society is becoming ever more

220
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:51,430
dependent on these things but I can't
say a lot more I dunno though what I'm

221
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,090
concerned about as a national security
analyst and what I think policymakers or

222
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,379
to be concerned about

223
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,850
and very particularly concerned about
the structure of social process sees

224
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,030
that is say the undermining of
capabilities and

225
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,970
things like the financial system

226
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:15,150
war the power companies and the like
that provide a backbone 44 capabilities

227
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:21,650
and I know that I'm concerned about how
things might evolve for individuals

228
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,720
support from the state me my first
reaction as the Internet of Things

229
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,300
evolved ever further was that this
represented a set of risks but from a

230
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,909
national security standpoint was all
that concerned if somebody can have my

231
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,630
refrigerator or if somebody causes an
individual or will be election and the

232
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,570
like but if in fact I'm a terrorist
group like Isis and I want to create a

233
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:55,070
ver can lack of trust and indeterminacy
in other contexts in America maybe if I

234
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,110
can make people very unsure about the
safety of their automobiles by

235
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,090
periodically causing them to wreak havoc
I can achieve my political ends in ways

236
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,860
that I need to care about so there's a
sense if you will of the character of

237
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:20,449
the problem and at this point you might
feel a little bit like this is just too

238
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,030
much

239
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,460
some dimensions to think about from a
policy standpoint but clearly it needs

240
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,640
to be thought about among the other
parts of my background I was at one

241
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,530
point of supreme court clerk working not
far from here for supreme court justice

242
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,600
and another supreme court justice
besides the one I was working for

243
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:49,590
Justice Douglas was well known as a
misanthropic sort of kind of love

244
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,939
mankind in abstract but he did the rest
of us but he one day fell to telling a

245
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,180
story about his father which I think

246
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,130
really was apocryphal but it's quite a
lot he said that his father was an

247
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,660
itinerant minister who wandered around
the Pacific Northwest and one day he

248
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,450
mounted his pulpit and looked out and
its audience and found just one guy

249
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,860
sitting out there and he said to that
guy you really want me to go ahead with

250
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:22,649
the service they looked up at him and
Justice Douglas said Cowboys said well

251
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,790
preacher understand on the couch and
what if I went to the field and food for

252
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:33,010
40 horses and found your sworn I
wouldn't let that one go hungry so

253
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,180
Douglas said he thought about his father
thought about that seems to make sense

254
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:44,310
that he proceeded to give all holes
service full board prayers hymns then he

255
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,800
walked to the back shook hands with his
congregation of one the Cowboys shook

256
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,120
hands with him and he did you wander off
his father couldn't stand it and yelled

257
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,110
after the Cowboys how did you like that
and the Cowboys as well preacher I'm

258
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,510
just lonely cow man but if I went out to
the field with from 440 horses in

259
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,920
founders 10 wouldn't do the whole load
on him

260
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,900
the problem in important ways 'as how do
you get beyond admiring the problem

261
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,140
dumping the whole load on you policy
makers and the like

262
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,890
wringing our hands and then saying we'll
have contributed so I think what we need

263
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,520
to do is get at the root causes and I'm
going to give you a little summary that

264
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:36,740
represents kind of an abstraction all up
in a store with the phenomenon of the

265
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,430
complexity of these systems Microsoft
operating system they don't reveal their

266
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:42,730
number

267
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,919
of lines of code ballpark fifty million
lines of code I asked major corporate

268
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,890
financial company person has to meet for
me how many lines of code is company

269
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:02,020
maintains and he's responsible for
answer one trillion these systems or as

270
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,179
others have observed the most complex
kinds of systems we've invented and that

271
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,790
means that we have extraordinary
difficulty observing them we have

272
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:17,428
extraordinary difficulty enabling us to
comprehend what's happening within them

273
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:23,440
and they have exceptional vulnerability
if you take the notion of the start no

274
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,799
shit in one book for every thousand
lines of code doesn't equal ability but

275
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,150
it gives us some sense of what's
involved when you're trying right out

276
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:40,080
fifty million lines of code in fact in
convened to policymakers this point

277
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,740
which is extremely important I think
their first intuition is you guys

278
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,710
created this problem it's a technology
problem fix either you were too if I'm a

279
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:57,660
right-wing politician you were too much
bad trip peace-loving hippies who didn't

280
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,120
care enough about security or if I'm a
left wing politician you guys are all

281
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,040
capitalist who just wanted to get the
software out the door cuz that's what

282
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,020
you got paid for and you didn't care so
I'm said to them

283
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,320
ok think about something in the world
you know the USA tax code tax code is

284
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,520
four million words write me a tax code
that doesn't have any loopholes now you

285
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,360
may object that there are a lot of
people out there writing tax codes with

286
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,729
the intention of putting in loopholes
but my point is if you write a four

287
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,390
million Word document

288
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,280
englishman give me an army of accounts
and lawyers struggling to find what are

289
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:42,260
called vulnerabilities in that document
also find them and you understand that

290
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,670
you cannot create something of that
level of complexity without having these

291
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,060
kinds of errors now give me fifty
million lines of code which are of

292
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,530
course even less observable to the
authors and remember you understand I

293
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,889
think if you reflect on it this is a
mass production operation it's not like

294
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,730
some single person in Microsoft's it's
their rights fifty million lines of code

295
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,980
and comprehensive it nobody
comprehensive it is put together as and

296
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,250
persecution of writing of different
things so don't think that there's a

297
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,830
technical answer to this

298
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,810
readily available at the scale and
complexity that we need it when you look

299
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:26,240
beneath admiring the problem in store in
analyzing it this is a central point and

300
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,270
it is then compounded by the phenomenon
of extensibility just that I've got a

301
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,090
Microsoft operating system it's gotta
work within Adobe Systems and Xcel

302
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,370
etcetera etcetera and an interactive
effect is going to create complexity

303
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,860
beyond anything that my own system
didn't even if I could somehow generate

304
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,750
my own system it's like the tax code us
to work with a whole panoply of other

305
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:55,220
business laws estate planning laws it
goes beyond that I have a communicative

306
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,470
problem these systems are designed to
communicate you understand that you

307
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,690
can't begin to comprehend how novel that
would have looked forty or fifty years

308
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,050
ago if you could go back in the late
nineteen nineties the director of the

309
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:17,770
CIA george tenet of very smart guy says
with testimony in the senate the enemy

310
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:24,190
is on our system or networks are open
and of course that's the case because of

311
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,580
the nature of the communication in the
more you let people in

312
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,409
in the more you connect functions all
the more you obviously enhance the risks

313
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,470
associated with these very complex
systems and you understand how

314
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:43,110
fundamental it is that we create that
communicative power it's at the core of

315
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:49,189
the virtues of the system the system
also concentrates information take for

316
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:56,470
example snow we've had a story from a
national security standpoint many people

317
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,200
like still people who come in and take
documents whatever their motives and

318
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,650
then hand them along what's unique about
snow is 1.7 million documents we've

319
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,730
never in the history of espionage had
anybody taking 1.7 million documents but

320
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,230
it's a consequence of the fact that in
these very complex and communicative

321
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,290
systems we concentrate information which
is again inherent in the virtues of the

322
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:29,580
system I want to create a world in which
an analyst can get ahead information

323
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:36,570
across a number of different domains I
want to have that ability in if I'm

324
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,770
running out of power system for example
I want to see the whole set of

325
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,500
transmission lines and the like or if
I'm running a pipeline system which

326
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,760
valves are open in which valves are
closed I want is it turns out also to

327
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,990
collect information and the information
age enables me to do that

328
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,820
Internet of Things will expand
exponentially my capability to do that

329
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,929
come back to the Office of Personnel
Management threat what we did was to

330
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:13,100
collect some 21.9 million documents
including from me then ran one to two

331
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:19,090
hundred pages included fingerprints
foreign contacts histories embarrassing

332
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,060
evidence in the light

333
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,320
put it all in one place and collected it
so than anybody who hacked into that

334
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,399
system could conveniently have at all
whereas in a pre cyber free digital age

335
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,460
that wasn't concentrated in those kinds
of ways and it wasn't collected with

336
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,770
anything like the same vigor because the
new information age

337
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:48,590
ways we all understand enhances that
capability smart man had a Microsoft

338
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,790
invented the phrase disintermediation
one of the advantages of the digital

339
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,480
world as we take human beings out of the
loop terrifically advantageous if I

340
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,000
start dealing with people who are
intermediaries in making my dinner

341
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,030
reservation or my travel reservation or
buying my tickets

342
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,070
most of the time I wound up being
frustrated as compared with digital

343
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,750
opportunity to do all that directly
myself on a larger national scale it's a

344
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,930
hugely valuable for example in
government that I've democratized access

345
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,860
to information when I was secretary of
the Navy I introduced an internet system

346
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,310
it had all kinds of technological
advantages it saved all kinds of money

347
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:35,429
but what I really valued was that I
could empower somebody in the

348
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:41,620
bureaucracy needed a new aircraft part
to simply see me inventory and order it

349
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,939
all without going through the silo of
the warehousing people will just six

350
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,630
people in the like all of which held
information as a source of power and

351
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,830
created division within the organization

352
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,270
removing those human beings is hugely
beneficial but it also removes

353
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,810
gatekeepers guardians people may observe
what's happening

354
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,850
wait a minute somebody's export trading
this financial information

355
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:12,449
or I got a request not just for a new
password but 450 new passwords or had

356
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,090
all these changes the human beings might
observe and finally the systems are

357
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,379
amazingly flexible they just say we
value the fact that our computers or

358
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,930
laptops can do so many different kinds
of things word processing communications

359
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,110
spreadsheets etc

360
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,600
the basic point I want to offer comes
back to the title of this talk the title

361
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:39,530
that paper and the graphic I showed you
before this is poison through this is

362
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:44,060
not a lot of position on taking there's
no way to turn this clock back I don't

363
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,669
want to turn it back but we need to
recognize that inherent virtue just

364
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:57,710
summarize them on the side is the risk
that to the degree that I concentrate or

365
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,860
communicate or take people out of the
loop etcetera to the degree i buy the

366
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,070
benefits of this technology

367
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,860
each and every one of those steps I
introduced security consequences that

368
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,030
are give risk giving rise to greater
risk the virtue of this system is

369
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,320
intertwined with its limitations its
liabilities in at risk and that is

370
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,270
fundamental it's not just that the
complexity of the system gives me these

371
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:31,110
problems one reason the technology fixes
don't just get me there is every time i

372
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:37,929
buy more security I tend to do so in
ways that involve some sacrifice of

373
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,000
mergers

374
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,540
I wanna spend a minute having talked
about software just to see a little bit

375
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,720
about hardware because the hardware
insecurities are quite quite real as

376
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,160
well and you were that easy example I'd
like to give its just people tend to

377
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,330
think about supply chain and all kinds
of sophisticated ways what's been made

378
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:03,779
to the goes into the f35 latest fighter
aircraft etcetera but I'm struck by is

379
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:09,970
even if you preserve your whole system
if it turns out that something you used

380
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:16,080
to power to get more power for your
iPhone as for example simply plug in

381
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,299
adaptor is made we have a device in it
that enables hacking into your iPhone

382
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:29,168
that connection is fundamental to the
range of issues is extraordinarily great

383
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:36,350
here and from an espionage standpoint I
just would point out to you you're all

384
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,610
familiar with the Stuxnet experience
listened talked about is the fact that

385
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:47,090
the Iranians moved to a particular set
of frequency converters and the like

386
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,350
because they became convinced that some
part power and hacked into what they

387
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:58,129
were buying to install in their nuclear
establishment from from abroad and they

388
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,889
had to begin to produce their own stuff
which then of course set them up for the

389
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:06,549
vulnerabilities of some of their own
stuff and also introduced a variety of

390
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:13,200
kind of inefficiencies so the global
supply chain gives us a chance to forget

391
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,419
her ability associated with the hardware
world and I want to show this

392
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:22,620
sophisticated audience this point but
just giving you a chance to reflect for

393
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,539
a moment on a statistic you're not off
and probably exposed to which is what I

394
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:36,240
asked a very simple question which is
with respect to the question of

395
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,590
transistors there's a nice little
cartoon that says this guy says you know

396
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,330
it's time for us to begin to spend more
time to us with our children he says to

397
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:54,500
his wife how many do we have if you
think about that as a problem

398
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,490
think about our transistor world and
imagine the question how many

399
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,290
transistors are manufactured globally
every second

400
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,610
just want you to think about this answer
I'm not gonna embarrass anybody by

401
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,290
having you stand up or embarrass me by
having one of you already having the

402
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,639
only answer let me tell you when I first
began to think about this a couple of

403
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,179
years ago I spent for awhile and did a
sort of back of the envelope calculation

404
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,300
and the number was so unnerving for me
that I managed to get some friends at

405
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,429
Intel to get to work on it may
eventually commandeered the Intel

406
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,150
research department they came up with a
number that was so disorienting that we

407
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,210
then had a couple hours of phone calls
finally we agreed on a number so I want

408
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,949
you to think about this question how
many transistors are manufactured

409
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,480
worldwide per second

410
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,139
just as a measure of how will you
understand those you got your number in

411
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:56,370
your head every second

412
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:05,319
14 trillion transistors the complexity
of this system the difficulty of

413
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,900
policing in the hardware side needs to
be appreciated and then of course

414
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,970
there's the human so here's a nice
pictures before snowden we had manning

415
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:20,790
the openness of the system to third
parties pretty striking one of the

416
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,990
leading series about Stuxnet is iranians
thought they had their system air gap

417
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,879
that there was a distance between their
centrifuge system and its software a

418
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,460
physical distance and the outside world
but of course all kinds of things

419
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,760
happened patches come down the system
needs to be updated contractors need to

420
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,120
go in and one of the theories about
Stuxnet is maybe some contractor got

421
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,819
infected brought in the virus etc if
you're running a a worldwide corporation

422
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,640
Aerospace Corporation for example you
have to integrate with all kinds of

423
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,100
suppliers from all kinds of portions of
the world and that

424
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,970
then causes you to share information
large numbers of people have access to

425
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,080
this information

426
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,200
huge problem and even if those people
are not malevolent the ability to

427
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,450
manipulate these people is pretty great
if people haven't read the next book I

428
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:17,100
always encourage one of mitnick's books
I always encourage them to do so

429
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,720
almost impossible to read that without
realizing need you too could be fueled

430
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,970
by mitnick and some clever social
engineering every system when you look

431
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,549
at it winds up having this management
problems and configuration problems

432
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,080
outside the software and outside the
hardware I've given you my password

433
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,360
example already so you're familiar with
many of the efforts to deal with this

434
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,970
the counter measures or a long history
we know that we tried barriers and

435
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:53,649
training but we have fundamental
problems with the leak very badly the

436
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,740
screening in the antivirals you're
familiar with the set of issues

437
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,470
associated with that dependency on
pre-existing signatures the way in which

438
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:06,109
the antivirals and lag the attacks the
way in which many of them actually

439
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:11,030
important role in their abilities
themselves and can be used as the basis

440
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:17,470
for exploits we've done a lot of hunting
the vulnerabilities it's nice to see the

441
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,640
rise of that effort I think it's as I'm
sure you can produce some benefit so is

442
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,319
active defense but that monitoring the
situation and the like

443
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,050
yields also limited benefits we can
create enclaves trip to greater degrees

444
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,330
of very useful kind of thing but again
the information needs to be shared and

445
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,060
as soon as we get into the sharing we
get into all the kinds of

446
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,680
vulnerabilities that are described in

447
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,598
inherent software vulnerabilities that
makes this it's hard for me to believe

448
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,800
and when you talk with the sophisticated
inside operators hard for them to

449
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,750
believe that they can't get into most
anything if you really cared enough and

450
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:03,079
had enough resources I talk to somebody
makes a career of it goes around dealing

451
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,720
with complex industrial systems and I
asked him how many times he's unable to

452
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:15,910
penetrate his client he said it might
have happened once it's so unusual the

453
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:22,359
vice president for security google has
said in a public context that wouldn't

454
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:27,609
Google organizers red teams they succeed
in getting in sixty percent of the time

455
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:31,210
there's war did forty percent of the
time that's cool defending itself

456
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,849
against its redeemed

457
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:39,920
I think we overstate the degree to which
we can defend these systems and what

458
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,440
happens is corporations like to hire red
teams that are firmly qualities of the

459
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,740
people who hired them so you don't wind
up getting good vintage billig good

460
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,009
penetration analysis ultimately about
what serious attackers will do I'm gonna

461
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,160
come back to the church Terrence point I
want to note that a lot of what we're

462
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,589
doing in effect is raising the cost for
attackers not actually preventing them

463
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:06,200
from ultimately penetrating

464
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,540
began to try and think about ways to
document that one of the things I did

465
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:15,930
was to get a company that has done some
involved invulnerability hunting at

466
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,419
Export Development and I asked them to
go back and go through their records and

467
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,329
show me through a rough indicator wanna
make too much of this is just a lost

468
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:32,099
relative on what's happened over time in
terms of their production function for

469
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,849
vulnerability discovery how many
researchers medium quality do they need

470
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:39,310
to find major

471
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:45,690
abilities and basically this chart from
2006 to 2011 shows you their production

472
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,840
function and shows you that in fact it's
gotten harder to find vulnerabilities as

473
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,320
we get things like buzzing and a whole
lot of different kinds of vulnerability

474
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,290
on store out there but if one researcher
could producer find choose significant

475
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:07,890
vulnerabilities in a year back in 2006
and only finds a half and that is it

476
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:13,600
takes him two years to find availability
on average in 2011 we've significantly

477
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,549
raise the cost for attackers it's now
four times as difficult as it was before

478
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:24,720
by this rough luster to measure but just
means that if you're hired four times as

479
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,259
many people you can produce the same
number of vulnerabilities I'm

480
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,190
simplifying but I think you see the
illustration another manifestation is

481
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,970
look at the vulnerability market look at
the government productions

482
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:42,470
here's a certain report every week we
get a description of substantial

483
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,560
vulnerabilities or look at point to own
and look at the successes that are

484
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:56,670
enjoyed at it by the top-level people or
the even the people who don't win we're

485
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,600
not at the very end of the distribution
and win the top prizes so you understand

486
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:07,029
all this hopefully this is a way of
conveying the problem and I want just in

487
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,570
my closing minutes to talk a little bit
about my own view about things we could

488
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,990
do to improve your situation given where
we are first of all fundamental

489
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:19,279
proposition that emerges from this is
presumed vulnerability presume that

490
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,860
digital vulnerability and in critical
systems treat this as though its

491
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:31,420
contested territory of phrase amicus on
today's used in some in some

492
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:39,099
create liens systems that is ones with
fewer tax services and recognize if this

493
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:42,020
is poison fruit go on a diet

494
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,049
ask yourself do I really need this
functionality because it's introducing

495
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:51,859
vulnerability in that doesn't just mean
enclaves in the like an easy example for

496
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:57,589
me is a printer most people think that
they want a printer to print seems

497
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:59,490
pretty evident

498
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:04,410
don't think enough about what marrying
up the fax capability with a print

499
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,660
capability doesn't terms of
communicating in connection to the

500
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:14,759
outside world how about the fact that my
printer has a Bluetooth capability that

501
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,549
enhances its vulnerability how do I feel
about memory in my printer most people

502
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:25,390
are buying memory and their printer and
don't want it I come back for example to

503
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:31,230
the example snowden he could steal 1.7
million documents could copy them I see

504
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,180
why is an administrator he could get
access but as an administrator was

505
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,259
nothing that gave him a need to take
this stuff out so far as I can tell from

506
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:49,430
the outside the answer to that is the
NSA people or not they disabled the

507
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:56,779
computer capability that would enable
replication what's known is not done and

508
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:03,180
he with a screwdriver reenable it so my
question is why did it have the

509
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,450
capability to begin with and the answer
is because we buy standard kind of

510
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,848
computers in these contexts all the time
they come equipped with this huge range

511
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:16,530
of capabilities we should be doing is
thinking more about us about slimming

512
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:22,089
down or systems I think we also ought to
think about the virtues of a demand

513
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:28,259
systems and about analog so let me come
back to Stuxnet it again as an example

514
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,650
one of the things that striking about
Stuxnet is it was not just a penetration

515
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:39,900
of the systems that control the
centrifuges it was and we know this from

516
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,050
the public documentation

517
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:48,870
a system that also deceive Iranian
operators as to what was happening but

518
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,500
playing back to them simply standard
operation of centrifuges when in fact

519
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,490
the centrifuges spinning out of control

520
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:04,120
fundamental design implication of this
is do not convert your situational

521
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,009
observation capabilities and your safety
systems to the same modality as your

522
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:15,880
operating systems if the Iranians had
had a plain old analog system that

523
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,790
measured vibrations of centrifuges and
when the vibrations began to get out of

524
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:21,830
control

525
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:27,029
sounded of physical alarm that ranked No
digital attacker from a distance could

526
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,200
have thwarted that system maybe somebody
could have gotten in the womb and

527
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,299
disabled one or five or ten but the
centralization in concentration of the

528
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,870
digital system and its community tivity
would have been offset by a plain old

529
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:47,290
analog system or I have a friend whose
comes out of the central intelligence

530
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:52,870
world he's paranoid as paranoia leads
him to have video cameras everywhere in

531
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:58,250
his house but being a smart guy he's
paranoid about his video cameras and

532
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:03,060
worried that people from the outside
world my tap into his cameras and

533
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,810
observe everything in his house so what
does he do he puts an index card next to

534
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:15,150
the video cameras when he goes out so
that if the camera is swivel the index

535
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:22,800
card falls over an analog system all i'm
suggesting is where systems are critical

536
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,670
we ought to be going through or safety
and control systems particularly and

537
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:33,060
where possible inserting analog
capabilities or creating resilience in

538
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,810
our operating systems

539
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:39,630
analog stand alongs sampling so this is
a Back to the Future kind of

540
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,710
prescription if you believe that as
always do that the digital systems are

541
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:49,850
inherently insecure you want this
complementarity here you also want to

542
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,200
separate those systems so the
contamination of one doesn't lead to

543
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,700
others you want in the words of the
resilience the risk to decrease the

544
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,799
amount of coupling the degree of
integration so I like having apple

545
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,370
system alongside a Microsoft System
simply because I've gotten some

546
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:14,370
diversity of vulnerabilities warden user
phrase the tenderers repeatedly used in

547
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,470
made famous I want to avoid a
monoculture

548
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:23,629
want to create resilience in this system
from a public policy standpoint I ought

549
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,950
to be saying hey there was some systems
out there of the power system the

550
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:32,750
financial system that this country
depends on so fundamentally then I'm

551
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,790
going to impose some degree of
requirement on them with a measurable

552
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:42,279
and security terms they are what we
recognize in other arenas too big to

553
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,800
fail we regulate or airplanes systems
and the like

554
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,160
demand safety standards we need to do
similar kinds of things in my view in

555
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,649
the Internet world but you have to
recognize the speed of change in so you

556
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:00,480
can turn my real regulated by saying you
must do X Y and Z because when you do X

557
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,040
Y and Z it becomes too straight jacket
and limiting and there's too much

558
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,060
variation between too many different
systems so I would delegate this

559
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:14,440
regulatory kind of requirement to the
relevant cabinet departments and

560
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:21,670
wouldn't have some overall fibers or
impose it and I wouldn't encourage them

561
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:27,090
to use persuasion subsidies everything
possible including ultimately regulation

562
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:33,580
to get companies to the point where they
provided a convincing case that they've

563
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,210
done what they could reduce these
vulnerabilities they diversified

564
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:43,370
desegregating the problem is very
important we need I think to recognize

565
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,480
the fundamental differences between
different industries in these contexts

566
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,290
for example of the financing the power
industries are dramatically different in

567
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,759
their business cases come back to this
point about the interaction between

568
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,440
technology and business culture if I run
a finance company I'm being attacked all

569
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:11,260
the time every day millions of times I'm
constantly refreshing my software please

570
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:16,980
see my boundaries understand that my
fundamental assets are digital they're

571
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,830
not physical and I'm at the very cutting
edge software and the like what I want

572
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,410
from government is information about a
tax and by and large I want them to help

573
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:32,660
share that kind of information and I
want them to leave me in a high degree

574
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,220
of freedom if I run a power company I'm
not as used to these kinds of

575
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:46,009
frequencies of attacks I have a much
slower cycle of operation i my financial

576
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:51,080
basis regulated I can't pour money into
any given time I have an annual

577
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,830
maintenance downtime period I'm gonna
react much more slowly I have a whole

578
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:59,480
different set of requirements I need a
lot of basic education from the

579
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,970
government about what's out there and
some reason of my standards with regard

580
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:10,649
to it in my tension with regard to it
and that's just example therefore I'm

581
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:16,530
very inclined to push this problem with
in washington to each of the relevant

582
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:23,790
government departments and enthusiastic
about longer-term

583
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:28,690
research and development in this arena
I've sketched why it is that I think

584
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,710
that the problems are inherent in the
technology but there are opportunities

585
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,230
in terms of making encryption easier to
use something we just talked about here

586
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:43,760
in terms of use of formal languages to
scale our capabilities to provide more

587
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,570
protection and the basic design of our
systems with the security focus would

588
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:55,680
yield I think a lot more benefits so for
example former secretary then maybe so I

589
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,440
say as the Navy develops its next
generation of submarine or destroyer

590
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,690
let's make it a national goal to say how
will I designed this system so as to

591
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:12,300
reduce its vulnerabilities to minimize
the amount of poison food it consumes

592
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,810
maximize my use of analog and out of
band systems maximize my use of formal

593
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,360
language protections that some key
junctions etcetera and when I designed

594
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,390
that system I'm gonna come up with
something very different from the

595
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,759
traditional battleship or I could do the
same in the context of the power

596
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,620
industry for example in the Navy world I
wanted integration of information at the

597
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:42,730
bridge a starkly the captain on the ship
to see it all but of course in a digital

598
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:47,500
age that creates a particular
comprehensive set of vulnerabilities so

599
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,960
how would I design my ship fundamentally
different conceptually if I take account

600
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,170
of this that's a project we're doing
over the course of a decade while we

601
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:03,640
evolve another system or talk to
recently the IAEA International Atomic

602
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:09,580
Energy Agency and my basic theme pushing
the analog kind of notion there was hugo

603
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,049
is a really good historically its safety
analysis and regulation and the light so

604
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:18,780
you say for example that we need to make
up a number here ten different cooling

605
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:25,610
capabilities so that if one or two or
three fail I've got the ability to bring

606
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,430
in the others and when you get some

607
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:31,950
significant number you think you built
in resilience and safety now you go

608
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:36,669
ahead though and improve the
modernization and digital systems that

609
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,760
will control these and you've created
one single failure point in what

610
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,809
previously worked in different failure
points you need regulators to recognize

611
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:54,710
but also as we design new systems you
need to create good thinking about how

612
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:00,760
we build them better protection against
those vulnerabilities I also because I

613
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,119
care so much about the business culture
and the like I'd suggest it isn't just a

614
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,050
technological problem and the tendency
overwhelmingly in washington is to

615
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:17,420
invest in the technology and R&D money
in technology dollars I'd like me

616
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,670
anymore

617
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:23,270
investments in these sociology and
anthropology associated with the use of

618
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,910
these systems it's why johnnie doesn't
use encryption its puts applied to the

619
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:33,020
larger system as a whole we need to
understand better what's going on within

620
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,680
these systems we need the number of
people will recognize this better

621
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,529
pooling of attacking formation and I
suggested in that paper your goal is a

622
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,940
nice example of how this is done a
private corporation my tour in the FAA

623
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,619
world

624
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:56,190
federal aviation world recognize the FAA
collected data on all aerial accidents

625
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,880
but didn't on your missus there was a
whole big issue how do we share

626
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,790
information about near-misses people
said I don't want the FAA regulating it

627
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:09,509
they set up a private entity in the
beginning only one or two airlines

628
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:13,930
cooperated over time with airlines on
the board and the like

629
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:18,118
ever-increasing numbers did it now
covers essentially all of us' aviation

630
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,349
industry FAA has a seat on the board but
FAA doesn't control the information

631
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:24,200
information is then

632
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:32,240
anonymized and share more broadly that
to me is readily achievable model I

633
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,930
don't need legislation and the like I
can move forward in that regard

634
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:40,790
power companies are beginning to do some
of this through first and other kinds of

635
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,520
activities

636
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:51,470
I'd like to add that very concerned
about the federal workforce and this is

637
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:58,890
a good example of how we might move in
this context from the traditional ways

638
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,390
of doing business which historically
those legacy systems are so embedded the

639
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,828
past is not dead

640
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:10,700
we have a whole set of federal hiring
and training standards and methods of

641
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,180
organizing that are very ill adapted to
the digital world that I just described

642
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:21,770
my suggestion is we could create a
federally funded research and

643
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:26,310
development corporation and Fri Dec
that's a private company there are many

644
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:31,900
such that already exists on the board of
one but I'm not pushing this for them

645
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,650
just as a general proposition we could
create a new one that would be a place

646
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:42,800
for people who were cyber skills to come
together and be hired would you hire

647
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,319
them well I don't really care in the
arena you will work in so much about

648
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:53,170
degrees and traditional credentials what
I care about is a skill that actually

649
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:57,859
for example finding vulnerabilities are
dealing with other peoples exploits

650
00:54:57,859 --> 00:55:01,210
so maybe I should hire by tournament

651
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:06,160
and higher winners who achieve in these
contexts what I want to do in terms of

652
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,029
training and the like I'm gonna put
these people together in a pool because

653
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:14,380
so much to learn is from on the job
training not just being in one agency

654
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,840
but moving between different federal
agencies and they learn from each

655
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,380
other's peers I want somebody who's
cyber skill to run this think about

656
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,690
putting it in a place like Silicon
Valley why do I need it Washington and

657
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,820
now suddenly I begin to be able to draw
a different kind of talent pool which I

658
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,000
can tell you I think we desperately need
and finally I want to just concluded by

659
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,440
talking for a moment about norms and
deterrence and I want to invite your

660
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,770
questions

661
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:48,110
lot of fuss now about the challenges of
our conflicts with the Chinese people

662
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:52,730
indicted in Pittsburgh from the PLA
People's Liberation Army in China we

663
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:59,060
have obvious sources of conflict over
espionage and over IP theft the point

664
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:05,330
i'd make though is we also have some
areas of strategic stability we haven't

665
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:12,259
yet seen stage attack one another to
speak of in the context are shutting

666
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,970
down their power systems or undermining
their financial systems the big

667
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:22,720
catastrophic kinds of things that I be
concerned about and I think we and for

668
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,020
example tried over Russia have common
interest in avoiding that formal warfare

669
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:33,380
it's just not good for either of us
ultimately to give you a slightly more

670
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:39,200
technical but suggestive example I don't
think it serves either trying to or loss

671
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,960
to probe each other's nuclear command

672
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,119
control networks with our espionage
tools why is that because we've

673
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,380
recognized that we have systems that
have gone somewhat under the name of

674
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:58,750
mutually assured destruction mad let's
say it's better if the chinese have a

675
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:04,670
second strike capability then if they
don't because if they only have the

676
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:09,369
ability to strike first and we threaten
destroying their missiles they need to

677
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:14,530
launch but if they know they have the
ability to survive an attack us even if

678
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,570
we attack foreigners the situation will
be more stable they'll be less likely to

679
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:24,380
attack and a hair trigger way but if the
whole system depends on cyber system and

680
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,390
the system is inherently insecure and
we're out there probing them and they're

681
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,848
out there probing on us and the same
tools as I said earlier that can be used

682
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,339
for the espionage can be used for often
now have introduced in security into

683
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:44,230
that world I moved from a world of Mad
two months mutually assured destruction

684
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:50,570
BC I still retain the same fondness for
acronyms mutually assured destruction is

685
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:55,580
less stable we can't find her way
towards some Emergen norms that agreed

686
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:00,220
that there are certain kinds of things
we won't do a lot of problems with this

687
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,549
a lot of challenges in negotiating it

688
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,119
enforcing it and the like we can talk
about them if you want but the reality

689
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,300
is that when we entered the nuclear age
we had no idea about arms control over

690
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:17,349
how to do it and slowly over time as an
emergent characteristic of the systems

691
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:21,750
we began to find our way towards some
stability and then we thought about them

692
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:26,660
and we began to articulate them in norms
and in arms control agreements and so

693
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:32,230
forth and we need in my opinion do the
same thing in the cyber world so I've

694
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:37,770
given you a real soup to nuts think it
may be that I've done the whole load on

695
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:45,450
you to excessively but I want to suggest
we all admire the problem we all see

696
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,589
that it's a brave new

697
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:51,670
world that these changes compressed into
decades or the equivalent of gunpowder

698
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:57,450
over the period of centuries that we
can't think as fast as the situation

699
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:03,239
demands but we need I think to move
beyond that sensation really trying to

700
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,739
analyze the core of our problems in our
tried to give you a little summary of

701
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:12,849
that today and to thinking not just
about the kinds of incremental defensive

702
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:17,930
kinds of activities that I've made
reference to but also most fundamentally

703
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:25,169
to try to structure institutions and or
programs and our norms in light of Borno

704
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,049
assists in ways that can make us
stronger

705
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:34,119
will we ever be completely protected in
OK in this area but we can improve our

706
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:40,799
batting average quite significant way I
can guarantee performance for success in

707
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,930
every single pitch that's thrown at me
but I know how it is that I could get to

708
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:50,129
a better world with a much higher
success rate a better batting average

709
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:56,559
and boy i wud extraordinarily valuable
so I thank you all for not having gone

710
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:07,190
out for haircuts and invite your
questions thanks very much

711
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:32,960
I love their dirty word our business it
would be that when people delivery

712
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,680
product it'd be like you mentioned slim
down there is a wonderful example

713
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:44,299
yesterday it worked during the
telematics talk given by Stefan savage

714
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:50,490
students and in that case there is a
device that plugs into the OBD port of

715
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:56,430
an automobile in modern automobile have
this it could you can control with SMS

716
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:01,490
messages you can using SMS message like
you send a text message to it and tell

717
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:07,009
it to update itself from the search your
choice you can have a do anything this

718
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:13,380
device has all the software on it needed
for compiling but for managing the

719
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,770
system it is not been slimmed down and
of course it has told controllers are

720
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:24,190
very keen disabling the brakes when
things this is actually more serious and

721
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:31,770
what Charlie Miller was talking about
his blackout so simply having it why

722
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:36,940
this happens because people most
developers are clueless they build a

723
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:42,180
system they're glad it works in the ship
it out the door they don't know that

724
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:47,390
they need to clean it up and slam it
down and minimize it so the footprint

725
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,980
that you can see from the network is a
very safe one so that would be a simple

726
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:56,950
thing that we could do ya so I think
you're right I think we see this very

727
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,120
richly lots of different arenas and you

728
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,509
one good example by the way the TV folks
have departed so you can preserve your

729
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:12,510
anonymity which puts you step out of me
but I think the reality is we're going

730
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:18,190
to get there were going to get to a
world in which will be more security in

731
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:22,260
these devices and instruments and the
Internet of Things

732
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,860
the question is help out the reason I
say that is the disasters that you're

733
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:33,450
worried about and I'm worried about or
going to the question I think will be

734
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:43,220
how much we can minimize them in advance
and how much we can prepare ourselves if

735
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:47,560
and when they do occur we're able to
respond with some rapidity

736
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,970
ineffectiveness we can at least program
some capability into those systems and

737
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:56,069
in my opinion the challenge of thought
leadership in this area whether in

738
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:01,510
government or within the industry is to
get ahead of the problem it will not be

739
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:06,200
broadly accepted until that moment but
if for example we have a crisis but if

740
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,049
for example your manufacturer and you
design your automobile to pay attention

741
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:15,860
to security would mean I'd give you any
market leverage now and everybody may

742
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:20,010
argue against it within the company but
if you can see that there will come a

743
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:25,060
time where that would be a defining
characteristic to people will demand

744
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,520
you can have the foresight to make a
financial investment against that I

745
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,280
think that's a winning strategy so I'm
trying to kind of get people as you're

746
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,270
trying to get us to be more sensitive to
this issue so that we move further down

747
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:43,120
that road and at least when the crisis
comes were able to add that I wish I

748
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:43,850
could do more

749
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:51,279
that's the most thanks thanks yeah I
full disclosure I'm Russia so my

750
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:58,670
question is well that's full disclosure
that's the extent of it had some very

751
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,830
scary because like your nuclear
facilities are connected to the internet

752
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,840
so you're saying that China Couture I
certainly hope your facility is a lunch

753
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:16,320
meat sales second thing is that how do
you like the news media that Russia's

754
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:22,190
hacked into pentagon how do you know its
Russian rights nuclear weapons against

755
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,540
China Russia

756
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:29,040
cyber attack and that's a common friend
and yes right now so I guess I'll say

757
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:35,190
well if somebody is trying to hack us to
respond to fool you know I write my

758
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:44,090
where I write like something I would be
addressed and then you know you're

759
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,430
racing a very important question the
question of attribution how do you know

760
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:54,009
where this comes from I thought several
different things over the years about

761
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:57,110
months about attribution

762
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:02,320
I've come to the conclusion that
attribution in the cyber arena in the

763
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:10,710
digital arena is not dramatically easier
or harder than in other arenas and this

764
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:17,040
is very contrary to the accepted wisdom
I recognize there is some instances

765
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:22,850
let's take the Sony where it appears
from the outside of observation from the

766
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:28,200
newspaper accounts it's relatively easy
government officials have said publicly

767
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,430
this is one of the easiest attributions
they've had occasion to do why is it

768
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:37,830
easy well it's partly a technical
analysis what IP addresses are used

769
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:41,779
through what gave ways it's also what
kinds of tools are being used or refurb

770
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:46,340
million with them are they being used
elsewhere but it's also political in

771
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:53,260
motivational now is it subject to
spoofing yes 101 stood still more

772
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,800
between North Korea and the United
States I could go through some of these

773
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:04,730
steps but not a lot of difficulty
getting all the earmarks right and there

774
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:09,120
were other contexts where attackers are
vastly more subtle but this is not

775
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:14,790
fundamentally different from most arenas
of attribution involving criminality or

776
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:19,620
other kinds of instruments when for
example a biological attacks were

777
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:24,920
launched in the wake of 911 involving
anthrax letters took the FBI six years

778
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:30,200
to figure out the perpetrator in the end
you use a whole lot of different kinds

779
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,870
of sources and different dimensions not
just technological ones you use some

780
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:38,020
insight into your enemies systems human
and format

781
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:44,100
observations about patterns of behavior
and the like and it's hard for attackers

782
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:50,730
to completely avoid all of those so you
mind up I think with about the same

783
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:57,190
ability to make an attribute of judgment
as you do in other arenas it's not easy

784
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:02,430
in many cases it's easier and others
it's always challenging but in my

785
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:06,149
opinion it's doable you look like you
want to make some mistakes then

786
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:14,810
promotions mistake and yeah well I don't
intend to launch nuclear weapons based

787
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:22,170
on one theory in this context but but
thank you tell us two quick questions

788
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:26,390
first on the FARDC question I'm
wondering what you think of USD digital

789
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:31,560
service and meet some of those
requirements and how the FARDC idea

790
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,790
would be different for developing cyber
talent in the government and then second

791
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:42,560
fell upon what are russian friend was
asking policy level but is the

792
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,170
government in a difficult position with
attribution because get a tribute to the

793
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:51,370
case of Sony doesn't attribute in things
that are sort of widely attributed

794
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:56,640
anonymously to China Russia in so we
sort of a tribute when it's convenient

795
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:04,589
we don't want it down and that makes our
credibility somewhat more difficult I

796
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:10,430
think tribution point or credibility is
challenged by the difficulty of someone

797
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:15,690
just asked you to come back to Europe
for Dec questionnaire moment but our

798
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:21,680
credibility is I think diminished by
first or unwillingness to reveal

799
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,630
information sources and methods
understandable were reluctant to do it

800
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:29,270
and second by the variation that you
describe where sometimes we do and

801
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:36,030
sometimes we don't what the government
actors different motivations and

802
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,630
different circumstances and different
considerations and then variation in

803
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:43,850
credibility strikes me as a consequence
of the fact that they're responding to

804
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:49,080
other considerations and I think it's
natural that they make if for example

805
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:55,840
you think china did acts and she's in
pain is coming to visit in September do

806
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,790
you want to use this as a time in which
you point that out and inflame

807
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:06,840
relationships or do you care about other
issues particularly or if you think all

808
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:11,920
bets are off and government espionage
and you're doing all kinds of things and

809
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,380
you're trying to emphasize that using
private espionage is not desirable you

810
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:21,150
may have a wholly different view about
about how much you gonna say about this

811
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:25,099
so I understand that they have these
conflicting pressures and I think it's

812
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,760
not unreasonable I'm sorry just wanted
to ask you offer for Dec question again

813
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,650
because I didn't quite get what you want
me to say

814
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:36,969
digital service which was developed
under the federal CIO and has been doing

815
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:40,390
a little bit of this going into
different agencies and looking at Cyber

816
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:44,820
concerns it's broader than just
cybersecurity readings do how does that

817
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:49,960
differ and you think that's the other
noble experiment on internally fine with

818
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,460
any yoga lot of different methodologies
for building this labor pool but what

819
01:09:54,460 --> 01:10:00,590
I'd like to do is build a labor pool in
the high hundreds up towards a thousand

820
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,620
or something

821
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,599
of people who move around between
different agencies of the federal

822
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,450
government

823
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:12,030
went and who have freed to Cork into the
kind we get in Silicon Valley and I

824
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:14,929
don't think we've achieved that yet it
may be that the corporate environment

825
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:19,320
you're describing is every bit as good
I'm just using that as an electrical

826
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:30,580
thank you thank you follow up on the
labor development question so one of the

827
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:34,420
really great things for all of the young
people in this room is that I can

828
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:38,260
guarantee that they'll have jobs they
are in one of the best fields to be in

829
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:43,320
order to guarantee employment I going
forward one of the challenges that you

830
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,559
could even become a professor at some
universities I do not wish that on them

831
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:56,980
he enters I'm really glad about two
things one is that the TV cameras are

832
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:04,769
often the other is that your ten years
to my concern to our students routinely

833
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:12,530
even undergrads will graduate and will
get paid in industry above a gesture 15

834
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:19,120
rate right and so and there appears to
be an Internet corporate capacity to

835
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,790
hire in security at this point because
it's not a unique prices for example for

836
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:30,950
the federal government but it is a
private sector crisis as well how is the

837
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:35,990
federal government to in fact compete
with the demand in the private sector

838
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:43,469
when they have real needs that are just
not as sexy to our students so I think

839
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,850
there are 3 answers first you're right

840
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:50,800
the federal government will always lose
people for the reasons you describing

841
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,970
it's a real problem

842
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:58,470
second though we have tools for dealing
with it that are a lot better than we

843
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:01,600
have as for example doctors etcetera

844
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,920
we finance their education bring them in

845
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,830
the military in return for a six-year
commitment that kind of thing we paid

846
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:13,489
people higher than the norm when they
have special skills in areas that we've

847
01:12:13,489 --> 01:12:18,739
historically recognized like medical or
nuclear engineering and the like but

848
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:22,839
part of the attraction of the FARDC
world for me is that I'm not in the

849
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,179
government pay scale any longer and I
can begin to respond more to market

850
01:12:26,179 --> 01:12:33,590
forces third comes back to your point
about what sexy subject that computer

851
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:39,390
scientists are always inclined to speak
about the reality I haven't specified

852
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:45,940
what around the reality is that the
government work is phenomenally sexy

853
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:51,150
that's why an ass a starkly has been
able to draw people they know they can

854
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:55,639
work on the best of the tools and the
like you didn't tell me it's often said

855
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:03,030
to be fair we yes GAO recruits from this
Community successfully with the sales

856
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:07,730
pitch hey you can be a cowboy with us do
things that you couldn't do legally

857
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:16,389
anyway out but hey protect our database
does not have the same poll I think

858
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:17,890
that's right

859
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:25,660
I think that's right but I do think that
if I could create an entity that has

860
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:30,470
some brand and that is high and it gets
over a number of problems of government

861
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:36,420
employment associated with everything
from prudential -ism to dress code if I

862
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,460
could create a critical mass of people
that mass would be attractive unto

863
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:44,930
itself and because ultimately the most
marketable skill is the defensive skill

864
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:50,140
not the offensive scale or it would be I
think unnatural kind of training ground

865
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:55,490
for people and again in the FARDC I can
move people back and forth more readily

866
01:13:55,490 --> 01:14:00,460
between government and private industry
so the first point still stands

867
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:04,890
this is going to be a problem but I can
do better I think I would have described

868
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:14,340
your concern for scholarships and
student and I want to share an

869
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:20,690
experience with you as you know the
military has a fellow in every

870
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:26,730
congressional office where the member is
on one of the Armed Services Committee

871
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:31,660
or the budget committee I went to every
really revealing state secrets here but

872
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:39,059
I went to every single one of those
offices and ask them to support

873
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:45,790
additional investment in scholarships
for students who want to work for the

874
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:50,630
united states government or are willing
to work for the united states government

875
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:54,950
not one of them was interested

876
01:14:54,950 --> 01:15:01,450
it is not a DoD Policy to invest in
these scholarships every single year the

877
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:07,300
NSA investment has decreased
monotonically and last year the DoD

878
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:14,360
spent more on than they did on
scholarships so if you actually are

879
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:19,950
interested in meeting the goals you want
to meet there are very clear policy ways

880
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:27,809
to do it there are existing existing
programs and so you know this

881
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:33,520
really nice gosh i'm happier here but
you know trying to spend as much on

882
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:43,570
scholarships next year as you do on
pencils so it's a nice statement very

883
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,920
gently delivered

884
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:55,530
I'm known for my delicacy with it
basically you these phenomena has led

885
01:15:55,530 --> 01:16:01,450
phenomenon you know when I was navy
secretary I once gave a talk in which I

886
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:07,120
put up a picture of a program for the
army-navy football game on December 5th

887
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:13,510
1941 and it was a large ad that said no
battleship is ever been some from the

888
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:21,560
air the day before pearl harbor there
just wasn't a sense so it's very hard

889
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,630
for people to adjust to the new so in
the scholarship programs for example the

890
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,710
existing constituencies that care
fundamentally about their allocation

891
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:36,810
money and when you argue in the pentagon
that we ought to put more money into the

892
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:41,120
scholarship program not just take it
away from some others etcetera to deal

893
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:47,019
with the things you're describing the
general reaction is I do weapons I go to

894
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,960
Scholarships so the blind you're
offering which is the right one doesn't

895
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,990
strike doesn't surprise me that you
encounter any resistance but I think

896
01:16:55,990 --> 01:17:01,320
basically your point is right we need to
invest longer term and a richer way in

897
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,909
this arena so I would encourage you to
keep at it

898
01:17:04,909 --> 01:17:14,098
and no train trip and I look forward to
your investment

899
01:17:14,099 --> 01:17:18,300
tell me first whether you're going to
have to be foreign investment now go

900
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:31,959
ahead and something that stuff on
alluded to which is sort of offensive

901
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:34,489
capabilities in the areas

902
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:41,098
the fact that we you know people seem to
talk about security a lot and in defence

903
01:17:41,099 --> 01:17:46,719
but we often have the same organizations
involved in and defensive effort is

904
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,189
offensive efforts and it looks from the
outside and many times it when there's a

905
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:56,219
conflict we invest in more enamored of
the offensive capabilities and invest in

906
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:02,800
having more insecurity so that we can
exploit it rather than more security

907
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,840
maybe because it seems more easier and a
lot of ways because you know you can

908
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,189
easily exploit these things whereas to
secure things you have to scroll thing

909
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:15,019
and so on how how can you how can we
address that and how can we have kind of

910
01:18:15,019 --> 01:18:19,570
trust in the government's efforts to do
these sorts of things well the thing to

911
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,759
point to a fundamental problem then it's
a piece with what we were discussing

912
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:28,669
with stuff on the attraction of the
offense particularly to professionals

913
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:34,459
who are more engaged in offensive things
historically put aside digital to new

914
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:35,539
things

915
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:39,959
military has been more attentive to its
offensive capabilities into its ability

916
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:43,480
to defend its logistics supply chain and

917
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,719
proves to be costly in actual combat
when you have that imbalance that you're

918
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,600
you're describing

919
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,020
I do think it comes in many ways to
educational that's really why I'm

920
01:18:55,020 --> 01:19:01,380
invested in trying to explain this may
be the biblical injunction that the

921
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:08,260
Trucial free right but I believe that if
we agreed that the challenge of

922
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,700
leadership in these arenas to get people
ahead of the crises you have to make it

923
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:17,860
real to them you have to explain it to
them and that involves not just saying

924
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:23,400
an abstract for example these systems
are complex and concentrated in a crash

925
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:28,929
but it involves showing them that they
involve fifty million lines of code or

926
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:34,020
14 trillion transistors manufactured
every second and giving them a sense of

927
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:39,200
vulnerability and then of the
consequences of it and I believe through

928
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,200
education on these points leaders can be
brought along to make more the defensive

929
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,800
investments that you're right they
arguing for I wish I could give you a

930
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:53,920
more powerful as a result some switch I
can pull its planting the seeds here

931
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,920
there and everywhere it's organic yes

932
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,750
National Science Foundation usual
disclaimer about my opinions not the

933
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:08,000
government's so the

934
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,570
you talked about the difference between
different industries and how banking has

935
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:19,290
different concerns and threats than the
power industry and so on and i i working

936
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:25,820
in my personal researchers in the voting
area we we see a lot of

937
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:33,259
folks saying that we can do Internet
voting because it's it's really not that

938
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:42,250
big a risk and then run our best to
somewhere in the audience today says we

939
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:47,800
shouldn't asked why if I can bank on
line I can't vote online but instead we

940
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,730
should be asking if Internet voting is
safe

941
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:55,820
why aren't they running to the security
for the banks if they figured it all out

942
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:01,240
so my question is are there other sorts
of parts of the economy

943
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:07,360
other than floating that have this sort
of miss conception that they alone are

944
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,080
safe and when the rest of the world
hasn't figured out how to be secure but

945
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,570
they are secure and how do we help them
understand what you've been talking

946
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:24,809
about today I do think there are areas
of confidence in the world which have

947
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:31,740
varying degrees of legitimacy for them
for example the military classified

948
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:42,000
system or the NSA system I think people
believe in and in my opinion there are

949
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,300
commercial analogues to that for example
the switch system and the like what

950
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:54,870
interests me the mechanism for transfer
funds between banks which was yeah but I

951
01:21:54,870 --> 01:22:02,480
think they with some freezing point to a
strong record of extraordinary numbers

952
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,820
of dollars of transactions relative

953
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:10,610
penetrations but your point is right
that is there's mobility still inherent

954
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:16,920
in the system would interest me the most
about them is can we generalize about

955
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:23,290
what makes those systems strong and
about where that vulnerability lies and

956
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:28,769
what we can do about it so for example
to the degree those systems already some

957
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:34,420
of them do use analog to protect
themselves or multiple factor

958
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:40,570
authentication or decentralisation and
decoupling so that the intrusion in one

959
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:45,299
part of the system still leaves the
system resilient to recovery that's a

960
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:52,940
very helpful thing and we want I think
vulnerabilities but to the rest of the

961
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,650
world that they have gotten a greater
degree of protection so let me just give

962
01:22:56,650 --> 01:23:03,589
an example I talked about red team in
order to how many companies not only do

963
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,750
penetration testing with their red teams
for their audit committees and the like

964
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:13,880
but say to the attackers now we're gonna
privilege you within the system see how

965
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:19,510
much damage you can do before we stop
you that's a very valuable tool it's

966
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:25,090
more companies use but others more
companies don't so I want to see us

967
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:29,540
observe these kinds of best practices
and spread them and you're seeing things

968
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:36,190
like digital as a system for sharing
this kind of information then gears been

969
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:39,949
running something which swaps
information between these I think that

970
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:45,940
kind of activity is very useful so I'm
after observing the system is quite

971
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:50,348
closely both to sensitize their
operators to the fact that they are

972
01:23:50,349 --> 01:23:51,130
vulnerable

973
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:59,050
Bowyer in my point but also deserve the
best practices from thank you talk to

974
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:03,250
the meters from the University of
Maryland College Park and I have a more

975
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:09,989
technical question about your patch lack
of patch deployment example that we've

976
01:24:09,989 --> 01:24:14,199
been we've been doing some work on
measuring deployment and we saw that the

977
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:18,570
more recent techniques for start silent
patching are actually able to patch

978
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:23,509
fairly large vulnerable populations
quickly so what do you think are the

979
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:30,110
barriers to adopting this approach is it
the fear that you might stabilize the

980
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:35,719
system or that an adversary might inject
malicious batches regulatory concerns

981
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:40,199
I'm sorry you asked about the barriers
to observation of the system or the

982
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:46,888
barriers silently without user
intervention the barriers to patching

983
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:53,469
approach that because that that is the
fastest way to yeah well I think it's

984
01:24:53,469 --> 01:24:58,659
pretty striking to me that all the
systems we come up with

985
01:24:58,659 --> 01:25:04,639
windup being subject to Subversion told
cannons encryption

986
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:13,010
on Clay's these observational kinds of
capabilities etcetera and with each new

987
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:19,340
technical innovation it's perfectly
useful step forward I applaud the kind

988
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:24,290
of work you're doing but it leaves us
ultimately our experiences persistently

989
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:30,250
that the attackers them find a weakness
in in that part of the system so I would

990
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,710
expect that you're going to see the same
thing in the arena is that that you're

991
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:40,450
describing over the time immediately
ahead how do you balance you know the

992
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:46,050
insecurity caused by the problem not
patched fast enough with the possibility

993
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:50,890
that something you know that the
patching system I might be subverted

994
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:56,970
yeah well I'm constantly in the patching
system balancing the the the

995
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:00,720
complications of patching the
introduction of a new system the

996
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,560
business costs and so on

997
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:08,850
with the security requirements that I'm
getting from it and in my view it's an

998
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:14,020
order I mean there is no general rule I
can I can offer I feel very different

999
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:14,820
about it

1000
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:19,579
and different industrial kinds of
context depending on how central

1001
01:26:19,579 --> 01:26:25,639
security issue and the like I also
though ultimately believe that the

1002
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:31,619
supply of 0 days for a serious attacker
is great enough that they're going to

1003
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:36,489
constantly find things even when we have
i'm happy to talk about this further

1004
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:40,619
separately though thank you I think less
to questions and then I should stop

1005
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:50,119
Postgraduate School I'm going to ask you
a question of building resilient systems

1006
01:26:50,119 --> 01:27:19,269
engineering systems and I'm a big fan of
speed in these contexts in the pentagon

1007
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:25,639
context of this is another example of
the embedded power the past the

1008
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:31,090
procurement process was designed in a
world where we confronted an adversary

1009
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:35,790
the Soviet Union that was remarkably
ponderous the system cold while the

1010
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:41,630
Soviet Union and this is a story of my
life and some dimensions the

1011
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:46,780
if the soviets were developing a new
tank we would learn about it

1012
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:50,139
intelligence and the like they would
have a five year plan succeeded by

1013
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:55,159
another five-year plan we are on our
side became just like them we would

1014
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:59,330
develop a five-year plan to develop a
new tank to perceive as long as faster

1015
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:02,909
than their five-year plan we did ok I
want to give a speech in which are

1016
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:07,480
observed that with the fall of the
Soviet Union the world's largest

1017
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:14,120
surviving operating communist system is
the you s military five-year plans

1018
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,769
uniformity you name it

1019
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:20,310
repression of freedom of speech we have
all the attributes of a good communist

1020
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:25,989
system so moving to the speed that
you're right knee pointing out is

1021
01:28:25,989 --> 01:28:33,280
absolutely imperative and in fact the
system is designed to do you risk by

1022
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:41,099
constantly surveying what we're going to
acquire whereas it's actually

1023
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,320
introducing more risk for the reason
you're right knee pointing out which is

1024
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,960
the speed of change so what we need to
do is invest more in spiral development

1025
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:54,870
and take advantage of the fact that
software can be realized and by much

1026
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:59,550
more quickly and by instead of buying
with the notion that the stuff gonna

1027
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:04,730
last 15 or 30 years the life of the
typical airplane orders ship that in

1028
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:09,150
fact it's going to be quickly voted six
months one year two years so that

1029
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:14,638
constantly going to be refreshed and in
my view that's a different system and it

1030
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:18,400
requires an investment of energy to get
us from here to there but your

1031
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:23,159
proposition is in my opinion right and
we need to move down the path you're

1032
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:30,888
describing thank you last question susan
mccur Columbia Journalism School I will

1033
01:29:30,889 --> 01:29:33,850
say that I really appreciate the focus
on the application of security and

1034
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:37,300
industry and especially the point you
made about kind of having leader

1035
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:41,179
technologies my favorite example and not
as the Samsung television

1036
01:29:41,179 --> 01:29:46,389
recordings what you say in your living
room and transmitted to Sams on my

1037
01:29:46,389 --> 01:29:49,229
question is that given that we live in
an information economy and a lot of

1038
01:29:49,229 --> 01:29:53,550
business models are currently built on
the collection of information how to

1039
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:57,920
incentivize industry to actually produce
technologies that are leaning that way

1040
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:02,800
when a lot of their thinking about how
they're going to actually make money has

1041
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,820
to do with collecting user data and then
selling it for operationalizing it or

1042
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:15,139
something like that so this result whole
big topic that's very important about

1043
01:30:15,139 --> 01:30:21,039
the relationship between security and
privacy and incentives to sell data one

1044
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:24,259
thing that's striking to me though is to
me

1045
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:29,659
security is actually more fundamental to
the business model of these enterprises

1046
01:30:29,659 --> 01:30:35,728
then the recognized and it's more
fundamental to privacy than privacy

1047
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:42,760
advocates tender recognized for example
I like I think everybody in this

1048
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:47,079
audience do not like the idea of the us-
government reading my email but if I

1049
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:51,860
entirely stay out of the security
business at least in my case I'm pretty

1050
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:55,228
confident that I'm subscribing to a
world with the chinese government reads

1051
01:30:55,229 --> 01:31:00,300
my email on balance I like that a little
less or you can say you just like them

1052
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:06,939
both the security requirements are
fundamental to the privacy interests

1053
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:14,949
that I've got and similarly if companies
are going out there and acquired data on

1054
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:15,900
me and the like

1055
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:21,039
at a minimum their business model has to
depend on keeping that to secure and if

1056
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:26,570
it turns out people can read that data
and on target and other people acquire

1057
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:32,438
credit card information from my company
the reality is my company suffers

1058
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:37,640
mightily you would think that lesson
wouldn't be learned it is being learn

1059
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:46,830
but it's being learned slowly you know
JPMorgan I recollect cybersecurity

1060
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:51,450
investment level estimated at 250
million dollars after they got hacked

1061
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:56,880
they raised it to 450 million dollars
public filings with the SEC written up

1062
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,900
in the wall street journal we need to
start shutting those doors sooner I'm

1063
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:09,460
still there have fundamental tensions
between or desire in the companies to

1064
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:14,760
acquire data and our privacy interests
as citizens but at least both ends of

1065
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,240
this equation order recognize that more
security would protect both their

1066
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:23,200
business interests and my privacy
interest so we're clearly sub optimizing

1067
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:28,780
even before we get to a tradeoff between
things so on this note I think I should

1068
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:35,309
and thank you all very much for your
involvement in patients particularly to

1069
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:41,220
agree you can get involved in this
policy discussion I really feel as

1070
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:47,270
though the fundamental problem is
getting people at the point where they

1071
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:52,480
understand this better policy people lay
people and the like

1072
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:58,240
also professionals like yourselves who
may not normally have as developed a set

1073
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,170
of policy interest if you buy my analogy
to the world of gunpowder these huge

1074
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:08,450
changes occurring we're talking about a
number of them in the course of the day

1075
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:15,660
people's minds lag behind the only way
to get us moving further is to bring

1076
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:21,030
people's understanding to reach a point
and for that if you don't do it and I

1077
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:23,719
don't do it whose gonna do it

1078
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:29,520
ultimately it depends on you so I hate
to impose a big national security

1079
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,630
problem on you but you are after all
meeting in Washington you have to act as

1080
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:35,090
though you are thanks a lot
