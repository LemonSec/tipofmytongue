00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
i'm daisy mashima from adac so in this

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,599
presentation i'll talk about a project

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
focused on designed enhancement of smart

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,000
grid honeypot system

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
so this is a joint project with my adac

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,960
colleagues as well as a cyber security

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,840
expert from custodial technologies in

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,640
singapore

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
so as you may all know so honeypot is an

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
effective tool to collect

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,680
intelligence about the real-world cyber

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
attackers and

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
malware by using the collected

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
information

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
we can fine-tune the cyber security

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,879
measures such as

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,280
anti-virus software firewall and

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,440
intrusion detection systems

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
and for these purposes honeypot has been

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
long used in a cyber security domain

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
however honeypot for the smart grid

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
system is still in early stage

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
specifically we do not see the

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
implementation of the honeypot that

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,439
emulates

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
the whole infrastructure of the smart

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,000
grid system with a sufficient cyber

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
physical fidelity also

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,040
we do not have an established

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
methodology for evaluating a goodness of

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
the honeypot system

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
so in this project we particularly

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
focused on these two challenges

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,439
let me first go through our approach

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
so we start with developing the

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,600
prototype of the honeypot system

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,840
that emulates a typical smart grid

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560
infrastructure so then

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
we evaluate this initial prototype from

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
the attacker's perspective by means of

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,279
penetration testing

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,079
then based on the finding we improve the

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,799
honeypot

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,720
implementation to be ready for the

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
real-world threat intelligence

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
collection

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
actually this step 2 and 3 are repeated

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,520
multiple times

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,759
to iteratively improve the quality of

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,119
the honeypot

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,520
let me next explain the initial honey

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
for design and

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
implementation so

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
we studied a substation smart grid

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
systems that are compliant with the a

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
state-of-the-art iec standard such as

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
the iec 681761

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
850 and then we designed the honeypot

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
infrastructure like

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,480
this and it consists of a battle control

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
center network as well as a battle

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
substation network

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
which are connected by a battle wide

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
area network

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
and the net control center network hosts

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,599
for example scada hmi workstation

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
and a historian database and vpn server

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
for the remote access

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
and firewalls facing the external

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,680
network

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,760
as well as the wide area network

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,800
in the substation there are vpn server

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
for the remote maintenance remote access

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
and also smart grid devices such as the

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
substation gateway

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,959
and ieds intelligent electronic devices

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
and also we have a firewall facing wide

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,360
area network as well as external network

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
so we think that this is a typical setup

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,360
that many researchers would start with

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920
so then our next step is to evaluate

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,159
from the attacker's perspective

84
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,840
so to do that we designed a penetration

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,959
testing by

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
cyber security expert so we first

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,480
developed

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,040
the attack scenarios based on the ones

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
discussed by the ics sat and ics cyber

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
kill chain

91
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,760
so our attack scenarios consist of

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
roughly two

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
phases so in the first phase

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
a remote attacker may aim at the

95
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,000
compromising a vpn

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
interface on the control center network

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,040
and or the substation network

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
to have a footprint in the system so

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,640
after

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,199
successfully penetrating into the system

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
the next step for the attacker is to

102
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
collect the information

103
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,600
in the system by enumerating the devices

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
or services

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
running there so then uh

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
next phase attacker's goal is to

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
inject a malicious control command into

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
the smart grid

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
devices in particular ieds so ied is a

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,520
basic

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
that is a communication endpoint in the

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,759
cyber science they are connected to the

113
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,639
physical power grid component

114
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
and attacker may be injecting a

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,240
malicious command by us

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
skada hmi workstation just like the

117
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
ukraine

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
power plant attack in 2015 or

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
attacker may directly inject a command

120
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
to the substation system

121
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,120
so to emulate these kind of attack

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
scenarios we

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,120
utilize the widely used cybersecurity

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
tools such as

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,080
n-map and metasploit

126
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
so then through the experiment we

127
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
identified a couple of issues we need to

128
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
improve

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
first one is the presence of the battery

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
machines hinted by the network open

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,199
ports

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,000
so to address this we close the related

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,479
ports

134
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,320
after all the battery machines are

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
studied

136
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
the second issue is a lack of live user

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,440
account on the windows machines

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
so like attacker sometimes exploits

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
existing user accounts

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
compromiser server so

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
in this direction we prepared the dummy

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
user account with a popular user id such

143
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,319
as

144
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,840
admin and weak password

145
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,199
the third issue is so say

146
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
our virtual implementation the smart

147
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
grid devices

148
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,919
exhibited a totally different osm device

149
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,039
fingerprint

150
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,160
when they are scanned by the uh

151
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,520
map kind of tool so

152
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,479
we will discuss a solution to this issue

153
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,599
in the next slide

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
so when considering a counter measure

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,360
against

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
os fingerprinting we categorize the

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,800
devices into

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
two types or smart grid devices into two

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
types

160
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
one is a passive device which only acts

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,840
as a

162
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
server in a tcp or udp the other

163
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
category is an active device which

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
also works as a client for example in

165
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,680
ied belongs to the passive device

166
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,039
category while the

167
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
substation gateway or plc belong to the

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
active device for example gateway

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
acts as a server for the scada html

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
extension on the other hand it works as

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,280
a client

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,758
towards the ied in the substation

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
so uh to to uh to deceive a device

174
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,240
fingerprinting

175
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,520
tool we first considered imitating the

176
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
network characteristic

177
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,479
so in this direction we studied the real

178
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,599
devices deployed in a smart grid testbed

179
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
in singapore and we

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
deploy the same set of network services

181
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,680
on the virtual ied

182
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,599
and also we assign the mac address that

183
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,759
belongs to the same company as the real

184
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
device

185
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
then uh to deceive the like always

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,199
fingerprinting through

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,560
such as nmap uh

188
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,599
maybe radical solution is to uh to

189
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
change a protocol stack implementation

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,800
of the os but

191
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
it is not often feasible so

192
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
in this direction to find the feasible

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
solution we find

194
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,479
we employ the open source software

195
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
called honeyd

196
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
which has a capability to receive a

197
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
device fingerprinting

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
so then we put a device honey d as a

199
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
front end

200
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,720
uh facing the network meaning uh

201
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,520
all the accesses of the hddb server or

202
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,680
iec 61861850 service

203
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
are proxied by the honeydew this way so

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
we can

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
effectively deceive the device

206
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
fingerprinting tool

207
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,799
we also have a dummy traffic generator

208
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,719
for the beta realism

209
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
regarding the active devices we first

210
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
did the same thing say we run the same

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,080
set of network services in this case

212
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
http

213
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
ic 6870 and ssh

214
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
and also we copy the mac address from

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
the real device

216
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
but uh uh to to deceive

217
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
like device fingerprinting uh

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,680
for active devices honeyd alone is not

219
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
sufficient

220
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,440
so because so say outgoing traffic is

221
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,920
not

222
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
supported by the uh honeydew

223
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
so we cannot deceive a passive

224
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,240
fingerprinting

225
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
tool but on the other hand the good

226
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,760
thing is that

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,880
the gateway or plc many of the active

228
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
devices run on linux type operating

229
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
system

230
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
so based on this observation we decided

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
to use a small battery machine

232
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,480
to emulate these devices and we run the

233
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
similar version of the linux

234
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,079
os on these virtual machines

235
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,560
and another important feature is a

236
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,959
logging on the honeypot system so like a

237
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,279
purpose of the honeypot is to capture

238
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,720
the attacker's behavior

239
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
so we need to implement the login in a

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,959
secure and tamper-resistant way

241
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,600
so to do that we deployed a number of

242
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
so-called transparent proxy boxes

243
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
throughout the honeypot infrastructure

244
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
so transparent proxy

245
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,279
is a sort of bump in the wire device

246
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
that can

247
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
transparently monitor the network

248
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,519
traffic so because

249
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
these boxes are not addressable by the

250
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
attacker attack

251
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
cannot compromise such a login also we

252
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,160
have

253
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,399
implemented application level logging at

254
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,600
the virtual ied

255
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
and plc and also substation gateway

256
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
the way we implemented this login

257
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
securely so we we provided

258
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
more detailed information on the paper

259
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,000
so uh this is the architecture of the

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
improved honeypot

261
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
and as can be seen we have deployed a

262
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
number of a transparent proxy in a

263
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,519
honeypot system

264
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
as well as application level logging the

265
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
information collected from the

266
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
application level login is found in this

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
table

268
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
so then let us move on to the evaluation

269
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
about counter measure against

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,480
os finger printing so we actually did a

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
finger printing using nmap

272
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
against our

273
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
virtual ied which is shown on the top

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,360
and rear ied and we also show the result

275
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,000
of

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
the fingerprinting of the original ied

277
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,440
implementation so as can be seen

278
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,720
initial ied implementation shows a

279
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
totally different fingerprint compared

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
to the real ied

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
on the other hand real ied and our

282
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,120
improved ied

283
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,839
shows a very similar fingerprints

284
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
but still there are some difference as

285
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
you can see

286
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
however so the sp isr and ss

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
these numbers are changes for each

288
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,000
scanning so

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
meaning the value fractured within a

290
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,880
certain range

291
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,200
so it is not a critical factor to

292
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,959
differentiating

293
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,079
virtual ied from a real ied so one

294
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
consistent difference may be seen

295
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,440
in a value called ipl but

296
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,959
this ipl value is different for

297
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
each model of the smart grid devices say

298
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:23,600
certain

299
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
certain model of the ied may have to 240

300
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
as shown here but

301
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,959
another type of smart grid device has a

302
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
164 actually

303
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
and there may be some other devices with

304
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,920
a different

305
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,040
number so in this sense without

306
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
a result of very detailed complete

307
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
knowledge about the exact model of the

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
device deployed in a target

309
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
infrastructure attacker cannot tell

310
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
based on the ipo whether uh this device

311
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
is fake or real

312
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,440
so regarding the uh os finger printing

313
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
of the active devices we

314
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
attempted the end map as well as the

315
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,880
pier

316
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
p0f which is a passive waste

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
fingerprinting tool

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
so for the uh

319
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
result with the end map we do not see

320
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,560
a significant difference and

321
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,839
regarding the pp0 fingerprinting result

322
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
we see difference in uh

323
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,839
message segment maximum segment size

324
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,519
element but

325
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,120
this number changes over the changes

326
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,399
depending on the network link so it is

327
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:38,880
not

328
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,920
again a critical differentiating factor

329
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,519
okay so uh let me conclude our

330
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,720
presentation

331
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,760
so uh in in this project we designed and

332
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
implemented a honeypot that emulates a

333
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,480
comprehensive smart with infrastructure

334
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,880
and

335
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
we presented the evaluation enhancement

336
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,800
procedure

337
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
uh by using a penetration testing

338
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,839
and we publish the outcome of the

339
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,279
project including

340
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,279
the virtual machine images on our

341
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,360
website

342
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
so regarding the future we plan to

343
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
conduct further evaluation with more

344
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,880
participants

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,760
for example by means of capture the flag

346
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
