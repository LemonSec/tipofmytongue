00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,840
hi

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,000
i'm rick derbasher and today i will be

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,719
giving you a brief overview of our paper

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,440
ics test bed tetris practical building

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
blocks towards a cyber security resource

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
the paper was a collaborative effort

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,480
between the seven authors listed here

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
all of whom are members of the security

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,080
lancaster institute at lancaster

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,800
university

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
in the united kingdom the core focus of

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,440
this work

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
is around the creation of a high-level

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
flexible model

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
used to support industrial control

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
system test bed design

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,719
however i will first provide an

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,640
introduction into industrial control

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,360
systems

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
before describing related work in the

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
space

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
this helps set the scene with regards to

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,000
the challenges we hope this paper

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,840
addresses

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
i will then move on to some initial

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,280
design considerations based on our

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,559
previous work

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,160
before introducing the experiment life

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
cycle which is used to support

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
discussions around our model's construct

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
and use

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
i will then cover the model before

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,360
breaking it down into

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
building blocks providing a bridge

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
between what can be considered a

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
theoretical concept and development

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
activities

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
this forms a structure to then describe

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,000
our baseline practical implementation

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
options

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
before introducing the concept of an

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
online living resource

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
and its future integration with the tide

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,520
h platform

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
for those of you who are unfamiliar with

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
industrial control systems

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
they are essentially a set of

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
computational resources used to monitor

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
control and automate industrial

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,320
processes

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
some of these underpin elements of

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
critical national infrastructure

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,439
including water treatment and energy

54
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
distribution

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
the figure here is cisco's extended

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,680
version of the purdue enterprise

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
reference architecture

58
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,880
commonly known as the purgey model

59
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,399
this is often used to provide a

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
high-level view of an industrial control

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
system's fundamental features

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,920
separated into distinct zones a safety

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,038
zone to manage

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,520
safety from functions a manufacturing

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
zone to monitor control and automate

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
operational processes

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,400
a demilitarized zone to provide a buffer

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
between the manufacturing zone

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,319
and the enterprise zone and finally the

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,200
enterprise zone providing i.t services

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680
and access to operational data via the

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
demilitarized zone

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,480
in order to explore in-depth side ics

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
cyber security challenges

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
testbeds are an essentials tool avoiding

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
the need to experiment exclusively on

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,599
live systems

78
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
making work in this space extremely

79
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
important across the cyber security

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
community

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,640
over the last six years or so the

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
security lancaster institute has been

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
involved in the design and build of ics

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
testbets

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
this has included links with both public

86
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
and private sectors

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
through collaborative engagement as you

88
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
can see from the list provided here

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,239
we currently have five existing

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
publications in this area

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
these span a number of themes from

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
design considerations to lessons learned

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,319
however if we look more broadly into

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,360
this space

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
we can find we can typically categorize

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
existing work into three topic areas

97
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,799
surveys theoretical concepts and

98
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,280
practical implementation

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
all of these add value to those looking

100
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
to develop their own test bets

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
but don't provide a single point of

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
reference

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,159
we often find that surveys are quite

104
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
high level and abstract

105
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
theoretical concepts can be rigid and

106
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,480
unclear from an implementation

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,599
perspective

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,519
and practical implementation work can be

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
narrow in scope often aligned to how the

110
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,319
authors have built their own facilities

111
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,840
these are the challenges that we wanted

112
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
to address in this paper

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,280
through the introduction of a high level

114
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,840
model and associated implementation

115
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,319
guidance

116
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,959
before moving on to our high level model

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,879
it's worth exploring key testbed

118
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
characteristics you may wish to consider

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,920
prior to designing and building a test

120
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
bed

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
this table is taken from a survey paper

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,200
of ours with the characteristics

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,279
extracted from a broad set of existing

124
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,238
literature

125
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,358
underlined to testbot objectives tbo

126
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,400
testbook architecture tba and testbed

127
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,840
evaluation process

128
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,199
tbe the value placed

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
on each characteristic should be driven

130
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
by end user requirements

131
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,080
for example the uk office for nuclear

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,120
regulation

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
provides a set of security assessment

134
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
principles which operators must

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,639
incorporate into their systems and

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,919
processes

137
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,440
this involves a requirement for

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
exercising established processes

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,919
using live scenarios where practical

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,720
dependent on

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
upon exercise aims developing a

142
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
comprehensive test bed across each

143
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,080
characteristic

144
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
may not be necessary for example with

145
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
the focus of an exercise is aligned to

146
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
human response a test bed's fidelity

147
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,759
requirements could be lower than an

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,840
exercise focusing on the use of security

149
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,039
tooling

150
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,800
once you have an idea on required

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
characteristics

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,639
it's time to move on to testbed design

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
and implementation

154
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
this can be a challenge and this is

155
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
where our model comes in

156
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,720
providing a high level starting point in

157
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
a minute i'll describe

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
each of the models layers in relation to

159
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
the experiment life cycle

160
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
this is made up of four key components

161
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
shown here

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
design instantiation execution and

163
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
analysis

164
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,000
these are quite self-explanatory

165
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
essentially

166
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
design involves a consideration of core

167
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
experiment objectives

168
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,400
and how the experiment needs to be

169
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
formulated to support them

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
including required equipment and

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
associated setup parameters

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
instantiation involves taking our

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,039
initial design

174
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,280
and realizing it through the setup of

175
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
our experimental infrastructure

176
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
execution is where we run our experiment

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
with analysis

178
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
taking experiment outputs and examining

179
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
them to meet our initial objective

180
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,759
if you're more interested in this

181
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
concept the publication

182
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
referenced here provides a more

183
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,240
comprehensive overview

184
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,520
so this is our model made up of four

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
independent layers and an infrastructure

186
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,080
bridge

187
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
with a safety and security wrap around

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
starting with the management layer this

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
acts as a central point from which

190
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
oversight of a test bed can be

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
established

192
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,639
this includes general functionality from

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
server management to network management

194
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
but extends to include the safety and

195
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
security wraparound

196
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
experiment instantiation and execution

197
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
is partially covered

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
by this layer for example management

199
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,080
access

200
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
to a hypervisor can be used to deploy

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
virtual machines within the experimental

202
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,400
layer

203
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
based on experimental design

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,319
requirements

205
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,919
moving on to the user layer this

206
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
presents an opportunity to centralize

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,039
and manage a set

208
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,800
of resources which testbed users may

209
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
require to spot experiment design

210
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
and to capture and analyze experiment

211
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
data

212
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
the functionality of this layer can be

213
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
viewed as the management of experiment

214
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
tooling and systems with visibility over

215
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,639
the experimental layer

216
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,440
as such experiment instantiation and

217
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
execution are also supported by this

218
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,000
layer

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
through access into the experimental

220
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
layer via the infrastructure bridge

221
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
for example this could include accessing

222
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
configuring enabling

223
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
and orchestrating the operation of

224
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
experimental layer devices

225
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,160
based on experiment design requirements

226
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
the infrastructure bridge simply

227
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
provides a

228
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
network infrastructure to control the

229
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
flow of data

230
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
between the upper layer and the

231
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
experimental layer

232
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
this can be a benefit when conducting

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
high risk research within the

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,280
experimental layer

235
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,639
limiting the spread of malicious

236
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,160
artifacts onto the user layer systems

237
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
forming the core element of any ics

238
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,800
testbed is the experimental layer

239
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,520
where all ics components are deployed

240
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
supporting experimental instantiation

241
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,840
and execution again based on design

242
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,759
requirements in addition to ics we also

243
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
consider related and emerging

244
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,400
technologies

245
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
such as building management systems the

246
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,759
internet of things

247
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,000
and the industrial internet of things

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
and so on

249
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
essentially anything encroaching into

250
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
the ics space

251
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
finally based on size and access

252
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,320
requirements a remote access layer can

253
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,919
be implemented accommodating

254
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
interconnectivity to the management

255
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,039
user and experimental layers it is

256
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,080
important to note

257
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
that just like the purdue model which as

258
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,599
discussed earlier

259
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,839
is used to compartmentalize core ics

260
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,920
elements into discrete zones

261
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
our model layers are not mandatory the

262
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
model is simply suggestive

263
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
with end users being able to pick and

264
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
choose capabilities to support their

265
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
objectives

266
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,360
as we noted earlier with the related

267
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
work abstract theoretical concepts can

268
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,519
be hard to implement

269
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,160
so what we decided to do was create this

270
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
figure

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,680
breaking each model layer down into a

272
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
set of practical building blocks

273
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
this is to provide a bridge between what

274
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
we can what can be considered

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
a theoretical concept and practical

276
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,920
implementation

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
currently these building blocks are

278
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
based on the research and experience of

279
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,519
those within the security lancaster

280
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,399
institute

281
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
but we wish to expand these through

282
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,080
broader community engagement which i'll

283
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,959
discuss shortly

284
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,120
using our model and its associated

285
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
building blocks as a foundational

286
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
structure

287
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,279
our paper provides practical baseline

288
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,160
implementation guidance

289
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,080
using the ics building block within our

290
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,600
model as an example

291
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
we know we'll need to consider some form

292
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
of physical process

293
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,320
this can be achieved through the

294
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
procurement of large-scale physical

295
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,959
systems

296
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,120
or small-scale models such as the two

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
pictured on the left from gunton fischer

298
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
technic

299
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
alternatively simulation software may be

300
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
more appropriate

301
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
which can be purchased from companies

302
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,079
like factory io or self-developed using

303
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,800
relevant software libraries this is a

304
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
very basic example

305
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
but hopefully you can see how the paper

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
has taken an initial starting point

307
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
with a set of design considerations from

308
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,399
our previous work

309
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
proposed a high level model aligned to

310
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
the experiment life cycle

311
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
logically broken it down into building

312
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,040
blocks and finally offered associated

313
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,800
practical implementation options with

314
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,720
supporting references we believe this

315
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
overcomes the challenge identified in

316
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,839
existing work

317
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,600
where information can be either too high

318
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
level focused on one implementation

319
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,480
approach

320
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
or lack sufficient detail for practical

321
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
application

322
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
however there is still one significant

323
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
problem that needs to be addressed

324
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
as a publication cannot contain

325
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
comprehensive overview of all practical

326
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
practical implementation options and it

327
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
would age over time

328
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
we propose a concept of an online living

329
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
resource

330
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
using our model and current building

331
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,160
blocks as a base

332
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
we have created a website which is shown

333
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
on the slide

334
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
this website contains our model with

335
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600
associated descriptions of each layer

336
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
current building blocks and all of the

337
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
baseline practical implementation

338
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
options described within the paper

339
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,600
in addition we've included a broader

340
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,519
range of implementation options based on

341
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
our own research and experience

342
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
as our testbed evolves we will continue

343
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
to update this resource

344
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
however we believe it provides the

345
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
foundation for something bigger

346
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
a community where others who have also

347
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,760
created ics test beds

348
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
can submit suggestions for adding

349
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,279
additional building blocks and

350
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,000
implementation

351
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
guidance currently this can be done by

352
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
sending us an email

353
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
to the address which is also shown on

354
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,399
the slide

355
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,600
moving on to future work to better

356
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
support a broader level

357
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,279
of community engagement the security

358
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,720
lancaster institute

359
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,680
is currently building tide age a threat

360
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,399
intelligence

361
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,279
data exchange hub we will look to port

362
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
our current living resource

363
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
over to this platform this will afford

364
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
us with the ability

365
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
to build something more comprehensive

366
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
we are hoping uh so we are open to

367
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
suggestions on

368
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
what this could look like perhaps a wiki

369
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,800
page or some kind of forum

370
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,360
tied h could also include elements such

371
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
as configuration files aligned to

372
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
implementation options or network

373
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,040
traffic captures

374
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,639
again this is something we want your

375
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,480
feedback on

376
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,880
with our current model acting as a

377
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,680
foundation

378
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
we believe the evolution of its

379
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
constituent building blocks and

380
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,120
associated practical guidance

381
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
can significantly reduce the barriers

382
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
faced when building

383
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,040
and developing ics test beds but we need

384
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
help from the community to do this in a

385
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
meaningful way that is sustainable

386
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
long term thank you for watching

387
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,079
we hope to see you on the 10th and we

388
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
very much hope to

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
enjoy your collaboration uh with the

390
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,360
online

391
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
living resource thank you
