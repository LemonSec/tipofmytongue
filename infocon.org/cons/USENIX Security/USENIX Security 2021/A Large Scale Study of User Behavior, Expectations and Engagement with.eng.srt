00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everyone my name is wei chon tao

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
and we are team of researchers from the

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,240
university of toronto and google i'm

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
really excited to present our paper

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,760
today which is called a large-scale

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,119
study of user behavior expectations and

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,800
engagement with android permission

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
we study the android permission system

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
because it is one of the key mechanisms

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
that users can use to control their

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,280
private data and how is it shared

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
the android permission system allows

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
user to grant and deny a permission via

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
runtime permission request prompt as

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,399
well as the settings menu

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
from a user standpoint a lot of factors

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,480
can go into users decision to grant or

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
deny a permission

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
these factors include how users use the

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,039
app

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
their expectations of the permissions

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,960
required by apps

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,280
whether app explains why a permission is

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,559
needed

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
users privacy attitudes

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,879
as well as demographics

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
prior work usually focuses on one or a

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,280
few of these factors or the interaction

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
between a few a couple of them but not

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,040
all of them

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,439
so our goal is to study the interplay of

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
all these factors and the effects of one

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
factor while controlling for others

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
with our goal there are also challenges

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
the first challenge is to collect data

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
of all these factors from the same

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,920
individuals this requires us to collect

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,159
both behavioral data as well as survey

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,360
responses

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
the second challenge is to gather data

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
from an international base of

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
participants without physically meeting

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
or even contacting them

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,400
therefore

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
we implemented an android application

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
called private droid as our experiment

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
tool and they use mobile online

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
advertising to recruit participants

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
we published our advertising materials

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,479
on google

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,360
reddit and facebook platforms user

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
clicked on the ass got directed to

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
privilege google play store page and

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
install and join our experiments if they

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,000
were interested

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
upon joining our

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,360
study participants need to answer a few

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,199
demographic questions

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
purple joys records the apps

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
participants installed and permissions

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
they grant are denied when running in

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
the background on their phones

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
upon deducting a permission decision

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
private joy collects participants

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
expectations

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,599
and decisions rationale through in situ

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,640
surveys

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
we adopted the rationales from a study

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
done four years ago to draw comparisons

70
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
and to see if the trends stayed the same

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,319
today

72
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,319
prima joy also records any permission

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,120
explanations provided by app

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
before requesting a permission

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
to measure users privacy sensitivity we

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
asked the participants about their

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,560
attitudes towards mobile privacy with a

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,040
modified version of the questions in the

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
iuipc scale

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
we collected data for six months between

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,599
november 2019 and may 2020 a total of

82
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,599
1719 participants from 10 countries and

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
regions remain in the study for the

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
required 30-day

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,319
period

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,560
over the course of our study

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
privilege observed over 36 000

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
permission decision events across all

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,959
permission types

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,040
deny rates vary a lot based on the

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
individual permission types as you can

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
see in the right plot

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
a microphone calendar and contacts have

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
the highest deny rates of 30 percent 25

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
percent and 19

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
respectively

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
the average deny rate across all

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
permission requests was 16.7 percent

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
which did not change much from a study

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,319
done four years ago and only in the us

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,560
some maps will explain why they need a

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
permission before actually requesting it

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,120
for example facebook wants to access

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,599
users location information and explain

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
why it needs that permission here

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
only after user acknowledged the

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
explanation message where facebook

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,120
actually requests the permissions

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
preparatory also collects dialogues that

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
have a single continue button or no

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
button at all

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,519
to understand if explanation affects

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
user's name behavior private joint text

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,798
permission explanation messages before a

115
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
runtime permission prompt using

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,680
heuristic

117
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
we define an explanation to be a text

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,919
view that contains a data collection

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
related keyword and a permission type

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
related keyword

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
our heuristic might result in

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
underestimating the presence of

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,639
explanations

124
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
so using this heuristic we observed that

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
the deny rate for permission request

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,880
that had an explanation before it is 7.1

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
percent less than half of the denier

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
rate of permission request without any

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
explanation

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
to determine if the presence of

131
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,919
explanation affects participants

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,560
decisions to deny a permission we use

133
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,960
the mixed effects logistic regression to

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,919
verify that having an explanation indeed

135
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
reduce the chance of permissions getting

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,479
denied

137
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
we measure user's expectation at two

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
points the first one is at install time

139
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
when users install an app we ask them

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,479
why they install the app and to list the

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,880
permissions they think the app requires

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
the second one is at runtime right after

143
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
a permission request occurs we asked

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
them if they expected the app to request

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
that permission

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,639
here we show the deny rates of the

147
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
permission request for which user

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,800
expected and did not expect it at around

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,680
time

150
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
as you can see in the plot for all

151
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
permissions the deny rate rates more

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
than doubled when user did not expect

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
the permission request

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
our mixed effects logistic regression

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
model also shows that unexpected runtime

156
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
permission requests are more likely to

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
be denied even when controlling for

158
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
other factors

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,520
now we look at behaviors according to

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,080
country and regional differences

161
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
we acknowledge that understanding

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
country to country comparison is

163
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,960
challenging because there are so many

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
influencing factors

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,440
our analysis with one analysis we did

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
was try to find similarity in permission

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
denied behaviors among all the countries

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
especially if participants from two

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,840
countries

170
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
are drawn from the population with the

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
same mean denial rates

172
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,800
we perform a country pairwise anova test

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
on the denier distributions and identify

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,240
two distinct clicks of countries

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
so countries seen within the same clique

176
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
in this context are similar with respect

177
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
to their mean deny rates

178
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,800
however for all pairs of countries from

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
the two distinct clicks that the null

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,479
hypothesis is rejected indicating their

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
populations have different mean demand

182
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,759
rates

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,400
us india and south africa formed one

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,639
click and these countries have an

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
average denial rate of 13 percent

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,880
canada spain argentina and france belong

187
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
to the second click with an average deny

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,639
rate of 21.6

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
singapore and the uk do not fit cleaning

190
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,000
it to either click

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
in this section we discuss the influence

192
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,479
of each of the dozen factors collected

193
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,639
in the study while controlling for other

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
factors in our mixed effects logistic

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,639
regression model

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,039
the model includes numerical privacy

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,440
sensitivity values calculated based on

198
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,160
privacy attitude survey along four

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
dimensions

200
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,599
there are also three binary values

201
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,479
representing the presence of explanation

202
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,120
whether participants expected a runtime

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
permission request or not and whether

204
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
the permission decision is in the

205
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
settings menu

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
four demographic variables are included

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
in the model with references levels

208
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
we also add a permission type as a fixed

209
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,919
effects in the model to control the

210
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,319
influence of different numbers of events

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,080
for each permission

212
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,639
participant and app are included as

213
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
random effects so that the latent

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,319
individual differences between

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
participants and apps are taken into

216
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,639
account

217
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
the result i'll mix the effects logistic

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
regression and analysis with all the 12

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,160
features and the random effects are

220
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,759
shown in the table

221
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,919
each row contains a variable

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
its accepted values

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
the identified coefficient value

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
indicating the directional change in the

225
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
permission deny rate with respect to the

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
baseline of a given factor

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
and the p-value indicating statistical

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,360
significance

229
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
many factors have statistical

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,159
significance as you can see such as

231
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
explanations our model shows that

232
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,279
providing a permission explanation makes

233
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,679
it less likely to deny the permission

234
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
request even when contributing for other

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
factors

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
when we look at the influence of

237
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,440
demographic factors such as country

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
compared to a user in the us those

239
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,880
coming from argentina canada spain

240
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
france and uk are more likely to deny

241
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,560
permission

242
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
india and south africa don't exhibit

243
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
statistical significant differences

244
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
compared to the reference country u.s

245
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,360
perhaps because they are both from the

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
same click

247
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
when comparing across different

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,360
permission types our model shows that

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,399
user's behavior does vary by permission

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,040
we we see that contacts and microphone

251
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
are generally denied more often than

252
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
location and overall participants deny

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
storage less often than any other

254
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
permission

255
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
there are also some limitations to our

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
study the first limitation is

257
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
participant selection bias due to the

258
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,360
nature of our participant recruitment

259
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
our study is biased towards users who

260
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
interact with online s and are also

261
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
willing to install an app that collects

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
data about their phone usage

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
also we chose not to scale the

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
participant rewards by country so the

265
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,040
compensation may look more attractive in

266
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,160
some countries

267
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,519
than others

268
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
the second limitation is that privilege

269
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
cannot collect data on app install or

270
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
permission events that occurred before

271
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
it was installed

272
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
therefore the pre-installed apps and

273
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
popular apps might be underrepresented

274
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,720
in our data

275
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
even though 36 permission 36 000

276
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
permission events may seem a lot of data

277
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
we have very little data when look when

278
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
we look at individual apps for example

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
the largest number of permission events

280
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
with an explanation for a single app in

281
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,160
our data set is only 5 55 or 54

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
which does not allow us to analyze users

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,160
behavior on individual apps

284
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,399
in conclusion we show that the online

285
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,480
mobile advertising is effective in

286
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
recruiting hundreds of participants for

287
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
cross-country user study

288
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
we used mixed effects logistical

289
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
regression to show that having a

290
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
permission explanation message reduced

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,959
the denial rate by more than half

292
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
we also showed that for permission

293
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,920
requests the user did not expect

294
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
it's more likely to be denied and this

295
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,079
holds true even when controlling for

296
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
other factors such as demographics and

297
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
the permission type

298
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
lastly we show that many factors

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,079
influence users decision to deny a

300
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,120
permission

301
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
these factors include users demographics

302
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
their privacy sensitivities

303
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
expectation of the permission

304
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,399
whether app provides an explanation and

305
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,839
permission types

306
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,920
that's all for this presentation thank

307
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,240
you for listening

308
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,560
you
