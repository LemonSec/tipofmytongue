00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
my name is nitya i'm phd student from

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,519
national university of singapore i'll be

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
presenting my work a stealthy location

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,840
identification attack exploiting career

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,400
aggregation in cellular network

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
there's a joint work with nishant

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,640
manchun and my supervisor minsuk anjun

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,199
location information is highly sensitive

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
and any leakage can cause serious

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
privacy threat

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,600
multiple works have shown that existing

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
lte network leaks location information

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
one such work demonstrates how the

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
attacker infers a driving route of a

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
victim by just observing the power

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
consumed by the phone

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
the main limitation here is that the

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,000
adversary needs to install a malware on

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,239
the victim's phone

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,559
another work shows how the adversary can

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,559
infer if a victim is in the same cell

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,079
area or not

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,920
the limitation here is that the

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,239
adversary obtains only cos grain

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
location information

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
in this work we try to answer the

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
following question

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,400
can an adversary identify a more fine

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
grain path without any malware

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
installation

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
the answer is yes

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
we propose a novel location

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
identification attack that overcomes a

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
limitation of the previous work

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,240
our attack infers a walking path of the

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,439
victim in outdoor and indoor multi-story

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,600
environment without requiring any

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
malware to be installed on the victim's

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,400
phone

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,159
how do we do this

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
we exploit a new side channel in career

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
aggregation feature in modern cellular

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,079
network

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,640
in modern cellular network the users are

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,439
served by multiple cells that is one

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,079
primary cell and multiple secondary cell

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,479
that supplements the primary cell

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,880
carrier aggregation feature combines

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,119
bandwidth across multiple cells to

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,439
increase the bandwidth

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
we discover a new side channel in the

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
carrier aggregation feature namely the

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
number of actively transmitting cell

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
at any given point of time

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
in this example the site channel value

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
is three that is one primary cell and

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
two secondary cell

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
so the next obvious question is

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,760
how can such seemingly not so useful

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
information be used to identify the

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,599
walking path

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
we introduce slick which is a stealthy

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
location identification attack

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
exploiting carrier aggregation and show

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
that slick identifies a walking path

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
using the side channel i'll now

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,319
illustrate how slick does this

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
to enable carrier aggregation user

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,680
equipment or ue measures the channel of

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
the secondary cell and sends a

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
measurement report to the primary cell

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
the primary cell then configures the

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
secondary cell using the configuration

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,800
message

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
this message is sent encrypted so

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
the adversary will not be able to read

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
the cell id assigned to the user

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
providing location privacy however the

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,239
side channel get leaked when ue has some

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,920
downlink activity

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,800
how

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
whenever ue has some downlink activity

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
the primary cell activates one or more

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
secondary cell by using this activation

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
bitmap message

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
this message is sent unencrypted hence

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
the adversary will be able to read the

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
bitmap message

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,799
as mentioned earlier the side channel

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
here is a number of activated secondary

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,760
cell hence the adversary observes two

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
secondary cell being activated for this

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
particular user

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
now as the user walks new set of

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,640
secondary cell gets configured and

96
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,599
activated now the adversary sees the

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
change in the number of secondary cell

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,599
from 2 to 4.

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
as the user walks further the new set

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,120
again gets configured and activated and

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,959
adversary sees a change from 4 to 3.

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
in this work we show that this variation

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
in the side channel can be used to

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
identify the walking path

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
i'll now present the threat model of

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
slick

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
the goal is to identify path among the

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
set of all candidate working path

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
slick adversary has a minimal capability

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
of passively monitoring the downlink

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,440
channel and a ue with career aggregation

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,360
capability

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,520
we assume the victim is on foot with

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,080
some downlink activity and the network

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
identity which is the tim c is already

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
mapped to the real world identity using

117
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
one of the previous attacks

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
slick is conducted in two phases

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,160
the first phase is the recognizance

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
phase where the adversary walks the path

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
of the victim multiple times to obtain

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
the labeled record

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,600
the adversary collects the record for

124
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
all k possible part of the victim

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,479
in the attack phase the adversary

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,240
monitors the downlink channel of the

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
victim to obtain the victim's record

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
which he compares with the labeled

129
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
record to finally identify the path the

130
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
victim is on slick has three main

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,560
challenges

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
the first challenge is

133
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,639
noisy side channel due to limited

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
downlink

135
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,919
the side channel can become noisy when

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,440
the number of secondary cell in the

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
label record is different from the

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
number of secondary cell in the victims

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,520
record for example the label record may

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
have four activated secondary cell but

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
the victim record may have only one due

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
to low data usage thereby making the

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
side channel noisy

144
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
the second challenge is different

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
walking speeds of the adversary and the

146
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,759
victim it's possible that the walking

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
speed of the adversary in the

148
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,280
recognizance phase is different from the

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
walking speed of the victim in the

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
attack phase

151
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
this can cause two different

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
measurements on the same path due to

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
which direct comparison may not work

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,080
the third and final challenge is related

155
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
to the evaluation of slick

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
the existing lte network typically

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
supports only three or four ca

158
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,400
while this is sufficient for slick to

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
work the attack effectiveness of slick

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
will improve further in the near future

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
cellular network which will have more

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,960
cas

163
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,759
so the third challenge is how do we test

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
slick in such near future cellular

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
network which does not yet exist

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
to solve the first challenge of noisy

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,680
side channel we propose to calibrate the

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,960
record to match the victim's record

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,160
that is we calibrate all labeled record

170
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
such that the maximum number of

171
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
secondary cell in the label record is

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
same as that of the victim's record for

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
example in this plot the x-axis

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,039
represents time and the y-axis represent

175
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
the number of secondary cells the

176
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,039
maximum number of activated cell in the

177
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,919
victim's record here is four hence we

178
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
cap the label record to have four as

179
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,880
well

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
this newly calibrated record closely

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
matches the victim's record thereby

182
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,120
reducing the noise to solve the second

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
challenge of different walking speed we

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
employ absolute value dynamic time

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
warping technique

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,080
absolute value dtw technique is a

187
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,880
variation of the standard dtw technique

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
that finds the best alignment between

189
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
two walks on the same path even when the

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
walking speeds are different

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
the main difference is that we do not

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
normalize the side channel value instead

193
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,120
use the absolute value

194
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
this is because absolute value leaks

195
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,560
location information for example when a

196
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,199
value of 6 is seen it means that there

197
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
is a spot in the walking path which has

198
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
6 secondary cell thereby leaking that

199
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,039
information

200
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
to solve the third challenge of near

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
future cellular network

202
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
we emulate with existing wi-fi network

203
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,039
details of how we do this can be found

204
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,360
in the paper

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
now i'll first summarize evaluation

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
result of slick and then present the

207
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,350
main results

208
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,919
[Music]

209
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
we conduct two types of experiments one

210
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
is a large scale experiment in the near

211
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
future cellular network

212
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
we evaluate slick when all parts are

213
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,720
fingerprinted when only some parts are

214
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
fingerprinted for different building

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
types and for limited downlink activity

216
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
and show that slick is highly effective

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
under all this condition

218
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,319
for the second type we conduct small

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,639
scale experiment in the current lte

220
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
cellular network and show the

221
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
feasibility of slick

222
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,200
so i'll now discuss the main result of

223
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,159
slick only due to the time constraint

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
please read the paper for the rest of

225
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,799
the results

226
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
for the large scale experiment we

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
collect four to six short indoor path

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
segments into multi-floor buildings in

229
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
our university

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
we then synthesize hundred to three

231
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
hundred parts by combining these path

232
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
segments of varying distance

233
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
[Music]

234
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,279
this plot shows the performance of slick

235
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
when adversary fingerprints all the path

236
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,519
in the system

237
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,160
x axis is the part distance and y axis

238
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,279
is the path identification accuracy

239
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
slick achieves 94 percent

240
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,519
400 parts of distance 200 to 250 meters

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,480
this increases to 98.4 percent when

242
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,120
longer paths is considered

243
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,680
the result clearly shows that slick is

244
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
highly effective in indoor multi-story

245
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,279
building in near future cellular network

246
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
now let me discuss three possible

247
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,320
counter measures against slick the first

248
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
counter measure

249
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,360
removes the discovered side channel

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
information completely by encrypting the

251
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,240
activation bitmap messages

252
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
although it is fundamental solution to

253
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
slick it requires some changes to the

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,519
standard

255
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,920
the second counter measure instead

256
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
reduces the side channel information by

257
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
adding noise bits to the activation

258
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
bitmap message

259
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,080
the solution can be readily deployable

260
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
but it is only partially effective

261
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
there is another counter measure that is

262
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,040
orthogonal to the earlier solution that

263
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,880
is to make the devices less identifiable

264
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
by changing the team sees more

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,839
frequently

266
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
it is however very well known that

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,360
achieving this in 4g is difficult 5g

268
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,519
seems to be doing much better

269
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
please check these recent attacks and

270
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,120
security patches in 5g

271
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
in conclusion

272
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
we discover a new side channel in

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,519
carrier aggregation feature

274
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
slick identifies fine-grained walking

275
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
path with 98.4 percent accuracy in near

276
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
future cellular network

277
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
we propose long-term and short-term

278
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
counter measure

279
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,600
and we have disclosed the one 1dt to

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
gsma who have acknowledged them

281
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,120
thank you
