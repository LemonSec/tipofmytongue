1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,360
hi my name is alison mcdonald i'm going

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
to be presenting work i did with my

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,280
colleagues on how sex workers stay safe

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
online

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
so first some context for the study

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,439
sex work is broadly defined as the

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000
exchange of sexual services for money

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
and like most other professions

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
different parts of the work have

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
migrated online in the last few decades

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,199
so for example sex workers may see

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,880
clients in person but use the internet

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
to advertise or collect payment

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,480
they may use the internet to build

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
community with other sex workers and

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,640
some psycho workers may work exclusively

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
online for example by doing live erotic

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
shows on camera

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,879
however sex work is still criminalized

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,480
in most of the world and highly

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
stigmatized

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,280
this means that in addition to the

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,360
general risks that safe sex workers are

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
going to be managing like aggressive or

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,360
obsessive clients they may also be

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,120
facing harassment police violence and

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
discrimination all of which may happen

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
online or be exacerbated by technology

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
so we wanted to investigate how this

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
population which has a significant need

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
to stay safe online

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
thinks about safety with the major

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
barriers to staying safe online are

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,119
and the strategies that they use to meet

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
these safety goals so with this we hope

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,560
to better support sex workers and

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
staying safe as well as learn how

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
security tools and strategies succeed or

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
fail for highly motivated users who

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
depend on them

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
we began this investigation through

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
semi-structured interviews with 29 sex

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
workers in germany and switzerland where

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
sex work is legal but regulated

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,360
we conducted these interviews in german

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
and english over an end-to-end encrypted

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
video conferencing service and allowed

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
participants to choose whether the

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560
interview was over video voice or chat

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
based on some of the emergent themes in

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
our interviews we designed a follow-up

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
survey which was completed by 65 sex

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,079
workers in germany switzerland and the

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
uk

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
which is also a region where sex work is

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,799
legal but regulated

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
we asked several closed response

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
questions about common protective

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
strategies to get a sense of their

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
prevalence

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,878
and one open-ended question about how

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,720
they define safety which we analyzed

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,400
with our interview responses to the same

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
question

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
all of our study protocols were also

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
reviewed by a sex worker consultant for

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,959
appropriateness

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
so first i want to present our synthesis

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
of how participants

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
define safety

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,879
we ask this question in both interviews

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,879
and surveys because knowing the holistic

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
safety priorities of sex workers is

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,319
central to understanding their decisions

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,560
around how to protect themselves

76
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
we identified seven dimensions of safety

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
physical safety

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
financial security

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,080
being able to set clear boundaries

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
respect both interpersonally and from

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
society

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,599
privacy legality and access to community

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,800
so we identify these different

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
dimensions but most important to know is

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,720
that they are very intertwined with one

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
another

87
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
the ability to meet one of these goals

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,840
may depend on multiple others so i'll

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,720
give an example of how that works

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,319
so this participant said if i had the

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,000
financial pressure to accept jobs

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
against my better judgment like someone

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
demanding a service i don't offer i

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
would be unsafe

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
so in this case the financial security

96
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,879
is necessary in order to maintain

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
boundaries with clients and to ensure

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
their physical safety

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
because these goals can be intentioned

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,799
we heard throughout our interviews that

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
participants sometimes compromise on one

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
safety goal to ensure another for

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
example using a letter an electronic

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
payment service rather than cash even

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
though it might expose their legal name

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,279
to a client

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
so next i'm going to discuss a few

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
sources of risk to these privacy goals

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
unsurprisingly clients can pose a major

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,799
source of risk they can be aggressive

111
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,480
and invade a sex worker's privacy

112
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,879
the sex work advertising ecosystem can

113
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,519
also be predatory um some platforms

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,360
steal and republish content without the

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
worker's permission leading to unwanted

116
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
exposure

117
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
what we heard from our participants and

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,560
also from the literature more broadly is

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
that

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
the more sex work is legal the safer sex

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
workers are because they can access

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
social services report bad dates to

123
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079
police and so on

124
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
but even laws that regulate businesses

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
generally and the internet can be a

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,680
source of risk

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
so for example germany has an imprint

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,919
requirement which says that businesses

129
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,680
must disclose their name address and

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
contact information somewhere on their

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
website

132
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
this means that sex workers with

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
websites must either disclose sensitive

134
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,759
information or risk violating the law

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
and finally other online platforms like

136
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
payment processors and social media

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
platforms make staying safe online

138
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
difficult for sex workers

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
some platforms discriminate against sex

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,199
workers outright

141
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,560
so for example

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
several participants described being

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
banned from airbnb despite never using

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,199
the platform for anything related to sex

145
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,400
work

146
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
in this example the participants said

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
that they used different photos

148
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
different email addresses and different

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
phone numbers and they still ended up

150
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,280
banned

151
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
in this case the source of the

152
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,199
information leak is not clear making

153
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
defending against this type of exposure

154
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
really difficult

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
we had similar problems with social

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
media platforms making inferences behind

157
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,080
the scenes resulting in for example

158
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
family finding work accounts or clients

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
finding a personal account despite the

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
worker taking every effort to keep these

161
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,400
accounts separate

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,919
and finally i'm going to highlight some

163
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,600
of the strategies that sex workers have

164
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
used to stay safe

165
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
several of these strategies were offline

166
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
strategies that are just augmented by

167
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
the internet so covering or checking in

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
with a friend or colleague before and

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
after an appointment for example may now

170
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
happen over video call

171
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
and similarly sex workers have always

172
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,199
had methods for warning each other about

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,720
bad clients

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,280
but now some of that has moved online

175
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,520
like through private groups or regional

176
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,919
forums

177
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
we asked directly about security and

178
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
privacy settings but by and large they

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
were not considered useful

180
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,840
among our survey respondents only 35

181
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
percent said that they depended on

182
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,639
security settings to stay safe

183
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,800
um frequently this was attributed to a

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
lack of trust in the tech

185
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
and this lack of trust led to alternate

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,319
uh often more manual solutions so for

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,479
example this participant removes phones

188
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,759
from the room whenever they're talking

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
about a sensitive topic

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
similarly few sex workers use security

191
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
tools we asked about encrypted chat vpn

192
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
encrypted email which could be both pgp

193
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
but also protonmail

194
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,160
tor password managers and cryptocurrency

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
some of the reasons given for not using

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,599
these tools were similar to what's been

197
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
found in other studies

198
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
that they were too much effort or not

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
visibly effective

200
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
but for our participants

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
some of them wanted to use these tools

202
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
but they interfered with other safety

203
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
goals they were trying to meet

204
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,160
so for example one participant said that

205
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,479
they wanted to use a vpn but the

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
advertising service they used required

207
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
you to log in from an ip in the country

208
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
in which you were advertising which just

209
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,599
made using a vpn difficult

210
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,840
this is a good example of how sometimes

211
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,639
not using a privacy tool like a bpm

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,400
is not a failure to take a protective

213
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
measure but a calculated safety decision

214
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
that also takes financial opportunity

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,520
into account

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,360
another challenge with these tools is

217
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,520
that many of them depend on clients to

218
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
participate in order to work so for

219
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
example if a client is non-signal the

220
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
sex worker can't use signal for work

221
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
either

222
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
so although sex workers by and large

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,039
weren't using security and privacy tools

224
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,240
they did have highly developed

225
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
strategies for staying safe online

226
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,160
and identity management was a big

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,599
component to this

228
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
many sex workers discuss how keeping

229
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,879
their work and personal personas

230
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,400
separate online was critical for

231
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,080
maintaining privacy boundaries and

232
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
physical safety

233
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
so this might work for example through

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
using an alias for work or keeping

235
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
separate accounts and devices

236
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,639
however this separation was often

237
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,520
difficult to maintain over time

238
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
so this participant says that it's time

239
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
consuming annoying and stressful to have

240
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
all these phones and personas and things

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
i have to remember

242
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
over time it just becomes more and more

243
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
likely that they're going to make a

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,719
mistake which could out them as a sex

245
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,640
worker to family or expose private

246
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
information to clients

247
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
and as in the airbnb example even when

248
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
they do everything as perfectly as

249
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
possible their accounts and identities

250
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
might still be linked through

251
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,839
unintelligible data aggregation

252
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,480
our participants also talked about

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
various forms of self-censorship like

254
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
editing images to remove their faces and

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
identifying tattoos and opting out of

256
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
personal social media rather than

257
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,240
trusting platform privacy settings

258
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
in another example of a manual solution

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
preferred over settings

260
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
occasionally they may even completely

261
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
delete work accounts so this participant

262
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
explains that even though they work

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
legally

264
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,279
they are worried about being banned from

265
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
countries that don't like sex work and

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
so they delete work accounts websites

267
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
and completely wipe their phone before

268
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
traveling

269
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,519
and finally a prevalent theme from our

270
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
interviews was that many participants

271
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,240
felt resigned to unwanted exposure

272
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
this participant said that despite the

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,240
fact they know the consequences could be

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
getting killed or deported

275
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,680
they still mixed up devices and accounts

276
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
past mistakes are also hard to undo so

277
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
participants sometimes dismissed the

278
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
idea of adopting security tools going

279
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
forward because they had already

280
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
intermingled their accounts and they

281
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,399
felt that there was no going back

282
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,440
so to return to our question of how to

283
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
support sex workers it's important to

284
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,640
note that

285
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
most of the most serious risks are not

286
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
solvable with technology

287
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,240
stigma risky laws and discrimination

288
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,160
but we can identify a few common ways

289
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,920
that existing security tools fail to

290
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
meet the needs of this population and

291
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,640
i'll mention two here

292
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
first most tools aren't built for users

293
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,959
with multiple personas

294
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
this is a documented risk for other

295
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
users as well for example trans people

296
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
may use different names for different

297
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,360
audiences as they're coming out

298
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
intentionally allowing users to have

299
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
multiple siloed accounts would go a long

300
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
way to helping users stay safe with less

301
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
effort

302
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,640
in a similar vein uh transparent or more

303
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,720
restrictive data use policies that allow

304
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
users to understand how their own

305
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
accounts may be connected or how

306
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
platforms label uh might be labeling

307
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
them behind the scenes

308
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,160
is as critical or more important than

309
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,839
having intuitive privacy settings

310
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,440
but just because they weren't using

311
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
security tools doesn't mean that sex

312
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
workers didn't have sophisticated

313
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
protective strategies

314
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,399
our participants highlighted several new

315
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,399
technical sex work tools that could help

316
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
them in particular like improved client

317
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
vetting systems and covering apps

318
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
but especially in light of how existing

319
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
tools fail to consider the holistic

320
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
needs of high-risk populations it's

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
important the tools built for sex work

322
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
are led by sex workers who have the best

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
knowledge of their needs

324
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,240
so in summary

325
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
digital safety has multiple

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
interdependent axes and sex workers are

327
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
optimizing their safety across all of

328
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
these axes in some cases technical tools

329
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
are falling short and are largely

330
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
untrusted and so sex workers have

331
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,560
developed

332
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,959
sophisticated alternate digital safety

333
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
strategies they're using instead

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,160
thank you for listening
