00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,719
hi and welcome to our talk on our paper

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,799
it's the company the government you and

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,519
i

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,440
user perceptions of responsibility for

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
smart home privacy and security

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
this papers joint work with julie haney

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,359
and suzanne ferman from the national

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,439
institute of standards and technology

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,680
and myself yasmin ajar from lightning

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,279
university hanover and the max planck

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,720
institute for security and privacy

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
smart home devices are commonly used for

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
attacks by malicious entities

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
privacy violations of failures to

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
adequately protect user privacy often

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,839
make the news

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
and users struggle to configure their

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,480
smart home devices

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
a question often asked in research is

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,399
how can we help users better configure

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
smart home devices

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,359
so that

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,120
so that their security and privacy can

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,760
be better protected however we've also

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
seen that users may be unable to learn

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
to do this because of non-existent

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,799
controls

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,400
and also because options are often

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
limited so in our research we go beyond

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
what can users themselves do and ask a

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,520
different question

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
in this research we ask the question

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
where do users see responsibility for

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
smart home security and privacy

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,439
and second what's the relationship if

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,960
any between perceptions of

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
responsibility concern and taking

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
mitigated action

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
so let's get a quick overview of our

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
methods

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,799
for a qualitative sample of 40 interview

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
participants we aim to recruit diversely

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
across gender and ages primary users and

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
secondary users for this we used a

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,799
recruitment firm participants qualified

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
for interview if they had at least two

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
smart home devices we ended up with 32

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
administrators and eight secondary smart

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
home users

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
our semi-structed interviews were

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,119
conducted in person by one or two

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
interviewers and lasted on average 41

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
minutes we asked questions about

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
concerns mitigations and responsibility

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
for smart home device security and

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
privacy

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,239
all three authors then conducted the

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
qualitative analysis we read and

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
annotated the transcripts developed a

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
code book coded the transcripts

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
developed teams around responsibility

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
and discussed implications grounded in

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
our data

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
for our results i'll hand over to julie

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
we asked our participants about their

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
privacy and security concerns related to

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,440
their smart home devices

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
about two-thirds voiced some kind of

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
concern for example fear of others

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,760
getting audio or video access or concern

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,599
about hacking being a threat to physical

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,720
safety

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
we also asked what type of actions they

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
take to address their concerns if any

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
with the exception of a few more

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
advanced mitigations implemented by

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200
technology savvy participants most

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,879
mitigations were simplistic or

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,640
non-technical in nature

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
for example the most frequently

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
mentioned mitigation was setting a

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,440
password on the companion device app

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
despite participants having security and

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
privacy concerns we found that concern

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
didn't always translate into action

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
for many smart home ownership was viewed

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
as a trade-off although participants

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
knew there were privacy and security

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
issues they were willing to accept the

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,080
risk for the benefits the devices

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,319
provided

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
others didn't know if or how they could

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,400
take any action some did not have the

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
knowledge to take action which was

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,159
especially true with security or they

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,599
didn't know what options were even

97
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
available

98
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
there was also a sense of resignation

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
that data is already out there via other

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
means like social media so it doesn't

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,440
matter what they do with their smart

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,159
home devices

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,640
we asked participants who they thought

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
was responsible for the privacy and

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
security of their smart home devices

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
which is the focus of our paper

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
they also expressed views related to

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
responsibility during other questions

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
throughout the interview for example

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,519
when initially asked what general

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
hesitations or concerns they had about

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,439
the devices

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,840
participants responses primarily fell

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,560
into three different categories users in

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
other words personal responsibility

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,478
manufacturers and government or

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,320
regulatory bodies

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
many times they viewed responsibility as

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
being shared among some combination of

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
these

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
18 participants claimed at least partial

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
responsibility for privacy and 28 for

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,400
security

124
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
we found three views of personal

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
responsibility

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,240
first some viewed taking responsibility

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,919
as holding themselves accountable for

128
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,360
accepting risk

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
as one participant expressed

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
if you don't want your stuff exposed you

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
shouldn't have those devices in your

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
home to begin with

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,520
others took responsibility as a

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
justification for an action

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
they accepted personal blame for their

136
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
own perceived deficiencies such as not

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
taking the time to learn what options

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
are available

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
one participant who accepted personal

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
responsibility didn't take mitigative

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,960
action because as he said

142
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
i'm not going to educate myself on

143
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
network security i'm very accepting to

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
the fact that it is what it is

145
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,880
finally for some responsibility means

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
taking an active role as one participant

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,639
said

148
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
i feel like the default is always full

149
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
access so you have to really look for

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
and pursue stricter settings

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
manufacturer responsibility was the most

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,440
frequently mentioned response with 28

153
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
saying that manufacturers were at least

154
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,440
partially responsible for privacy and 30

155
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
for security

156
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
we observed an attitude that

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,440
manufacturers have an obligation to

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,080
protect consumer security and privacy it

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
was an unstated manufactured consumer

160
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
contract put in place a time of device

161
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,280
purchase

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
as one participant said they the

163
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,440
manufacturers need to do everything

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,039
since they're taking so much money for

165
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
all that

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
yet there were varying levels of trust

167
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,639
of manufacturers

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
some participants do trust them based on

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
things like company reputation and

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
sometimes they felt it was in the best

171
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
interest of the company to implement

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
strong security and privacy as one

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
participant said

174
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
if they have a bunch of massive security

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,199
breaches people are going to stop buying

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,039
their products so our interests are

177
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,880
aligned there

178
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,639
however others while believing

179
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
manufacturers should implement adequate

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,360
security and privacy were not certain

181
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
they would or could

182
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
as one person said

183
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
i don't have much trust in what

184
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
companies say they collect and don't

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,680
collect i think they collect what they

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
can and use it

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
15 participants mention the government

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
or regulators as being responsible for

189
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
smart privacy only five thought the

190
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,759
government was responsible for smart

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,919
home security

192
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
a participant saw government regulation

193
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
of smart home privacy as being a

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
consumer safety issue and said there's

195
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,400
other safety precautions put in other

196
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
industries i don't see why that

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
shouldn't be something applied to this

198
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
industry as well

199
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
one participant didn't think the

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
government would do the best job but

201
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
felt that regulation had some benefit

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
she said

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
we've got to do something to protect

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
people's information or at least make

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,560
them more aware of what exactly is being

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,520
utilized and sold

207
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,639
finally over half the participants

208
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,479
viewed responsibility as being shared

209
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
between some combination of users

210
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
manufacturers and the government

211
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
for example

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
one participant viewed responsibility as

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,160
being shared between the manufacturer

214
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
and himself

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,840
and he said i'd like to see the vendors

216
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
take more responsibility and take more

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
action to secure their own devices but

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
because they don't always do that and i

219
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
don't always necessarily trust them to

220
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
do that i take it upon myself to be

221
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
responsible for the security of these

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
systems

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,240
now for the implications of our research

224
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,759
i'll turn it back over to yasmin

225
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
thank you julie we see opportunities for

226
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
improvement with and in the interactions

227
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,160
between users manufacturers and

228
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,479
government or third parties

229
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
users can make risk-based decisions that

230
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
protect data devices and the whole

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
network manufacturers can make sure that

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
they implement privacy and security by

233
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,199
design and meet standards and

234
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,560
regulations

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
governments and third parties can

236
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
coordinate guidance and enact security

237
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
and privacy policy and regulation

238
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
talking about interactions users can

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
inform manufacturers about their

240
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,039
challenges and perspectives on security

241
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,440
and privacy manufacturers can listen to

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
users provide usable controls

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
transparency and tips

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
users can also inform government and

245
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
third parties about challenges and share

246
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
their perspectives

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
where those have to listen inquire and

248
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,920
provide assurance and education finally

249
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
manufacturers can participate in

250
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
guidance development working closely

251
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
with government and third parties who

252
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
can provide standards

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
guidance and regulations to

254
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,680
manufacturers

255
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
to summarize we talked about the

256
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
responsibility for smart home security

257
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
and privacy where in a qualitative

258
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
survey of 40 smart home users we

259
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
identified that users think that

260
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
responsibility for smart home security

261
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,959
and privacy is shared by users

262
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,399
manufacturers

263
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
third parties and government and that

264
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
there are opportunities to do better

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,160
when these parties collaborate and

266
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
support one another thank you and we're

267
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,279
ready to take questions

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
you
