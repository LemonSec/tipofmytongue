00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,679
hello everyone my name is fong i'm a phd

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,200
candidate at stony brook university

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
today i will be presenting our paper

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
which title how great is the great five

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
words measuring china the next

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
censorship this is a joint work with

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
researchers at stony brook university

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,560
umass amherst the citizen lab and uc

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
berkeley

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,199
since the internet has become an

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,920
important means of modern communications

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,519
governments around the world are

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
increasingly controlling the free flow

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,520
of information on internet china and

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
russia are some notorious country where

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
internet are heavily censored preventing

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
their citizens from accessing numerous

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
websites and online services so when it

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,079
comes to internet censorship china's

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,840
great fireworks is known to be one of

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
the most sophisticated censorship system

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
on internet which has been developed for

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
more than two decades and as you can see

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
this earlier article about the great

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,039
fireworks was from 1997 and even until

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,680
today the great fireworks is still being

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,199
sturdy and sometimes occupy the

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,438
headlines of several newspapers this is

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,799
because the great firewall is still

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,200
being actively developed and updated on

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,520
a regular basis to allow the chinese

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,760
government to control over what can and

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,600
cannot be assessed by internet users

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
inside china

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,799
so there are several filtering

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,799
techniques used by the great fireworks

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,600
including dns tampering ip blocking

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,560
keyword filtering and active dropping of

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
this technique dns tampering plays an

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
important role in china internet

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
censorship because almost every online

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
activity announced that they start with

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
a dns lookup and this censorship

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
technique will also be the focus of our

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,759
study

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,920
as you can see from the network trace i

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
have here which i capture a dns lookup

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
for the domain getitp

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,880
dot net from a machine i have in china

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
for those who are not familiar with itp

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
this is one of the popular anonymity

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
networks on the internet

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
since get i2p is sensors two factoriness

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
responses were injected and the

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
correctness response still arrived at my

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
computer but after the two fact response

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
have already arrived and therefore

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,239
poisoning my dns resolutions and from

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
this censorship case we draw some

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,879
initial observations about china's dna

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,599
censorship behavior first multiple fact

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
dns responses are injected and the

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
forced ip addresses are publicly

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,959
valuable and they dynamically change and

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
mostly managed by

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
u.s organizations including facebook

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
twitter or ibm

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
so those unit

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
filtering behavior have motivated us to

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,360
conduct a measurement study to

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
understand more about china's dna

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,360
censorship and we are interested in

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
answering these research questions like

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,840
how many sensors do men are there what

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
are the fact ip addresses used in dns

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
injections and are they totally random

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
or is there a set of ip addresses that

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
are being used by the great fireworks

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,080
and more importantly we want to evaluate

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
the impact of the great fireworks the

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
next censorship on the global internet

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,200
and finally based on the findings of the

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
about three questions we want to

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
investigate how to effectively detect

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,080
and circumvent the great fireworks dna

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
censorship

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
so when building our measurement system

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
we have these requirements in mind first

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
it should be able to discover as many

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
possible

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
sensor domains in fact ip address and in

92
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
a timely manner

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,599
second it should be able to obtain and

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
test new domains as they appear on the

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,239
internet and third as a longitudinal

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,319
measurement platform once a domain is

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,400
discovered to be censored the system

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
should continuously keep track of the

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
domain's blocking status and to see if

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
the domain stays sensors or become

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
unsensor at some point in the future and

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
finally by measuring

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
many domains with sufficient frequencies

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
the system should provide us with a good

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,000
view into the pool of fact ip addresses

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
used by the gratified work which then

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
can be used to design effective

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
circumvention tools

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
so to that end we designed a measurement

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
system

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
called gradify watch

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
with our test list curated from dns zone

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
files and updated every day this allows

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
us to obtain new domains as they appear

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,799
on the internet however zone files along

116
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,000
contain only second level domains and we

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
may not be able to observe the blocking

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
of other subdomains so we complement our

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
datasets with domain from the citizenlab

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,759
test list the trend copies and finally

121
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,160
domains from the common core projects

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
this way we can cover as many

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
supplements as possible and from our

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,960
machines located in an unsensor network

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,840
we send dns queries heading two word

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,919
machines under our control

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
located inside china and this machine

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
they don't have any dns resolutions

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
ability

130
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
and now at this dns queries passing

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
through the great firewall inspect

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
structure which has been shown to be

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
near the border gateways of china any

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,680
packets carrying a sensor's domain would

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
trigger effect response

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,160
so this way we can be sure that any dns

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
responses returned to our machine in the

138
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,600
u.s

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
is a bad one so it's important to note

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
that we could do this experiment because

141
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
a very well-known behavior of the great

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
firework which is bi-directional dns

143
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
filtering

144
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,440
in a similar manner once we found sensor

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
domain by probing from outside we

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,440
transfer this domain to our machine

147
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
inside china and problem again from

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,360
inside to validate our fightings and

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
also to detect if there's any change in

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,639
the bi-directional filtering behavior

151
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
so over the nine-month period of our

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,440
study

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
we

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,520
detected 311 000 domains that trigger

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
great fireworks dns censorship and in

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
this plot we note that there was a shaft

157
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,520
increase around august 31st and we found

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,320
that this is because of an addition of

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
more than 30 thousands subdomain from

160
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,039
the previously sensor's namespace with

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,120
our

162
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,199
googlevideo.com and appspot.com and as a

163
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,280
result we need a better accounting

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
process to not overcount different

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
domain sensors under

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,800
the same and more general domains

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,199
so that motivates us to find a better

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,080
way to count and our goal is to find the

169
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
shortest domain that can trigger

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,880
blockings and for each

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
sensor domain we test eight different

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
permutations concatenate with random

173
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
string and this way

174
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,720
help us to improve the accuracies of our

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
counting process and here is how we do

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
it first we concatenate the sensors

177
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
domain with the random string put it in

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,240
front of it with and without the

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
delimiter dot

180
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
and similarly we put their sensor domain

181
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
after the random string with and without

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
the dot and finally we put the sensors

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
domain in the middle of the random

184
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
string under four different permutations

185
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
so

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
any domains blocked under rule threes is

187
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,639
considered as blocked as intended

188
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,880
because any domains fall under this rule

189
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
a legitimate subdomain of sensor's

190
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
domain

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
similarly domains block under group 1

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
and 5 can also be considered as blocked

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
as intended because these are the form

194
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,759
of a domain

195
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
with different top-level domains for

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,440
example we have google.com and

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,199
google.com.au

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,599
however any domain sensor under other

199
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,080
rules are overblocked

200
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,319
so with this new counting method we

201
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,440
discovered a total of 138

202
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
thousand space sensor domains from 311

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,960
sensor domain file earlier

204
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
also based on the new cutting process we

205
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
found many innovative domains being

206
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
overblocked a notorious case is that the

207
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
torah project domain is blocked on the

208
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,919
root 4

209
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
like this so as a result any domains

210
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
ending with torprojection.org are also

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
censored for example we have the

212
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,479
ventilatorproject.org and the

213
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,080
mandaprojects.org are also blocked

214
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
so with the new counting process we

215
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,879
found 41 000 innocuous domains being

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
overblocked most of them are blocked

217
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,840
under

218
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,400
this rule and this table lists the top

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,879
five base sensor domains that impact the

220
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
largest number of innocuous domains and

221
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
as you can see here there are also

222
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,919
internationalized domains that are being

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
impacted by this overblocking group

224
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
so during the course of nine months of

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
our study we also discover a new

226
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
behavior of the great fireworks which is

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
designed for geoblocking so what is it

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
on august 8 2020

229
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
we detected the blockers of this domain

230
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,399
belong to the chinese government this

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
website offered a service to allow

232
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
website owner to obtain and verify their

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,679
website internet content provider's

234
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,480
license what is obligated to legally

235
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
upgraded

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,440
a website in china

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
so this domain has two authority name

238
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
servers and

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
all of them are hosted inside china and

240
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
as a result dns queries for these

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,120
domains from outside china

242
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
will always be poisons because the

243
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
resolution path always crossed the great

244
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
fireworks and this is what we get back

245
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,080
for visiting this website from outside

246
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
china if you can recall from earlier

247
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,800
slides the great fireworks use public

248
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
routable ip address of many us companies

249
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,920
including facebook in the dns injections

250
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,160
so this is why we are seeing the arrow

251
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,399
page from facebook

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
and how can we be sure that this is a

253
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,399
jeep walking case because visiting the

254
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,640
same website from inside china we still

255
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,519
get the normal website so this geo

256
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,160
blocking behavior is widespread as we

257
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
have identified almost 62 000 domains

258
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,920
maybe geoblock because at least one of

259
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,080
their name servers is located inside

260
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
china and our fighting helped to

261
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
partially answer a long-standing

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
question of why china's great fireworks

263
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
there's bi-directional censorship this

264
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
evidence showed us the great fireworks

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
is not only used to prevent users in

266
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
china from accessing sensor content

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
outside china but also used for

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
geo-blocking of china-based website

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
so the bidirectional dns tampering

270
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,839
behavior of the great fireworks has

271
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,320
caused cash pollutions in many public

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
dns resolvers around the world so this

273
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
slide showed the top 10 public resolvers

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
with the highest number of sensor

275
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,360
domains whose poison records have

276
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
polluted their catch

277
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
and this necessitates a sanitization

278
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
mechanism to assure the quality of the

279
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,120
next resolutions and many other dns

280
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
related services on the internet

281
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
so we next analyzed the fact ib

282
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,200
addresses used in dns injections

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
and we fire a total of 1781

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
ford's ipv4s most of which belong to u.s

285
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,640
companies and

286
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,600
1799 ipv6 all of which are bogus

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
territorial addresses

288
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,959
so during the nine months of our

289
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
measurements there are

290
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
three different periods during which we

291
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
observe different numbers of forced ip

292
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,920
addresses and analyzing these periods

293
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,720
independently and as a whole we find

294
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,519
that not all ip addresses are equally

295
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,160
injected in sensory responses

296
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,440
in april and from may to august there's

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
only around 200 ips are used in more

298
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,800
than 99

299
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,079
of sensor responses and since september

300
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
2020

301
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,640
there are 600 ip address

302
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
that are being used in more than 99

303
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,519
of sensor responses so these findings

304
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
show that there is a pool of ip

305
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
addresses from which the great fireworks

306
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,560
frequently used for dns injections and

307
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
the discovery of this pool of ip

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
addresses can help to effectively

309
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,399
circumvent china dna censorship more

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
than 99 of the time so in summary the

311
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
outgrade 5 watch measurements platform

312
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
has made these contributions

313
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
the system exposed china censorship

314
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
policies in a timely manner it also

315
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
discovered unknown dns blocking

316
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
behaviors of great fireworks including

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
overblocking geoblocking and the

318
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,680
injection patterns of facts ip addresses

319
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
and the collected sensors domains and

320
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
forced ip addresses can be used to

321
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,720
assist in the sanitization of poisoned

322
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,519
records from public dns resolver cash

323
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,160
and finally they can also help with the

324
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,279
development of effective strategies

325
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
for detecting and circumventing china

326
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,720
dns censorship

327
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
so we thank the open technologies fund

328
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
for supporting this study and thank you

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,959
for your attention

330
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
you
