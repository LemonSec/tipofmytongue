00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,360
hello everyone i'm takami sato a phd

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,759
student from ucla supervised by

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,759
professor g alfred chen

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,640
today i represent our work that the lord

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
can attack security of deep

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,960
learning-based automated land centering

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,199
under fiscal world attack this is a

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,359
joint work among the asca research group

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,240
at ucry by dance and north eastern

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,879
university

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
automated lens entering system alc is a

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
level 2 driving automation technology

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,280
that can automatically steer a vehicle

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,079
to keep it centered in the traffic lane

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,879
alc is widely available in many recent

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,399
vehicles as shown in the slide

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
in this study we married target an open

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,640
source production alc called open pilot

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,879
which has representative design

20
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,680
dna-based camera lane detection

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
and reported to have closed performance

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
to tesla autopilot and gm supercruise

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
open pilot can support over 80 popular

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
vehicle models by installing a dashcam

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,479
on the windshield and override the

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
cruise mode of the beaker as shown in

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,560
the photo

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,520
as in the videos open files can handle a

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
wide variety of driving scenarios

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,479
an open part is

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
very stable in diverse traffic and

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
environmental conditions

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,520
alc is very convenient for human drivers

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,240
however it is also higher security and

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
safety critical listener the

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
vulnerability of dn models are widely

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,399
reported

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
so we wonder whether such dna level

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,439
vulnerability can lead to the whole alc

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,240
system level attack effect

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
to answer this in this work we are the

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
first to systematically study the

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,479
security of dn based alc in the designed

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,119
operational domains basically load with

45
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
landlines and the fiscal world

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
adversarial attacks

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
while we know dn models are vulnerable

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
in general

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
there are three challenges before we can

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
understand the arc system level

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
vulnerability

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,720
first

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,640
there is no domain specific and

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,160
deployable attack vector for alc

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
for example we cannot use low side

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,760
objects such as stop signs or billboards

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
since it will not be included in the

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,000
model input area or region of the

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,599
interest or roi

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,959
based on the detected landlines the lrc

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,959
actuates a vehicle in a continuous

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,480
closed loop lateral control process

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,360
here

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
attack on the single frame can only

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
cause mirror metal level lateral

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
deviation

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
to make attack effects on continuous

68
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,519
frame

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
we need to handle camera frame content

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,319
interdependency due to attack

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,920
which we will detail later

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,879
further we actually don't even have an

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,280
applicable attack objective function for

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
alc

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,640
as prior designs for image

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
classification and object detection

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,519
focus on changing class level or

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
bounding boxes

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
but we need to change the landline

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
shapes

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
beyond that we also need to make it

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
differentiable for effective

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,799
optimization

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
now let's talk about the first one

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,920
at the high level this is to handle the

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,239
semantic gaps from the perturbation in

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
the physical world driving environment

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,799
to those at the model input level

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
as we said earlier the model input area

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
or roi is focusing on the low surface

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,519
so our question is

92
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,840
what on the low surface can be both

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
seemingly benign and possible for attack

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,560
purposes

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
one things come into our mind is these

96
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,239
dirty road patterns

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,159
which can commonly appear on the low

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,200
surface

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,120
and can have large and complex patterns

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,079
but can it attack afc

101
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
to explore this we design a deployable

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
attack vector for dirty load patterns

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,639
30 row patch or double attack

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
that products pretend to be benign low

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,639
patch but the surface patterns are

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
designed for adversarial attacks

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
the left one is an example of double

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,639
attack

109
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,040
to pretend to be benign low patch we

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
design various stealthiness constraints

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
such as only in a gray scale and

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,800
preserving the original landlines

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
as in the light such patches can be

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
quickly deployable

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
let me show some demo to concrete's

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
attack idea

117
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,639
first is in a miniature scale physical

118
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,919
world setup

119
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,479
we printed a small patch and press it on

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,280
the load texture

121
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,560
and this is official openbar.com

122
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
now we move it forward

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,400
as we can see

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
the length detection results are always

125
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,000
significantly bent to the left

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
without the patch the open pilot

127
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
detection is actually pretty robust as

128
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,000
shown this attack is also robust against

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
different viewing angles

130
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
when we move the dashcam to the left

131
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,440
until light in the lane

132
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,080
as we can see the attack impact is

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
always significant

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
while it's indeed a severe crash

135
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,840
it is still simulation so maybe in the

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
real world driving other driving

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,840
features such as aeb can prevent this

138
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,800
attack thus

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
we further perform a rear vehicle

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,199
experiment to understand this

141
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
we first obtain the attacked model

142
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
output trace from the simulator

143
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
then inject them during the real-world

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
driving test

145
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
here is a video

146
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
all safety features like aev are active

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
but it still crashes into the cardboard

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,919
boxes we tried 10 times but did not

149
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,720
observe aeb in any of them

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
we do of the pre-collision wiring sound

151
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
but it's usually immediately before the

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,160
crash like 0.74 seconds here

153
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
which is very hard for driver to react

154
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,199
in time

155
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
to eventually make the attack work like

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
that is not so easy as we said before

157
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
one challenge is about the handling

158
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
camera frame contain interdependency to

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
make the attack continuously effective

160
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,759
let me illustrate here

161
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
to generate the attack

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
attackers first need to correct the

163
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
camera frame content of the attack

164
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
location

165
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,479
however if attackers place the patch on

166
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,639
the load

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,919
the press the patch changes the three

168
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,560
and the decision of alc and the camera

169
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,479
frame content will be different from

170
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
when they are corrected

171
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
this causes the perturbation areas in

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
the frames to be very different

173
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,360
which directly affects the attack

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,240
generation during the optimization

175
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
but

176
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
how to obtain attack influence the

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
content on the fly during the

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
optimization

179
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
there is a query on information loss

180
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
here

181
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
here we notice an interesting

182
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,160
opportunity due to roi

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
the model input only use the center area

184
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,800
of the camera input

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
so the law images actually do contain

186
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
the missing information in the attack

187
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,080
influenced frame

188
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,879
this may make it possible to synthesize

189
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
such content update dynamically during

190
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,520
the optimization

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
to achieve that

192
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,759
here is our method

193
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,759
we first obtain attack influence the

194
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,039
stair angle from alc

195
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,440
second we calculate the vehicle position

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,759
on the heading in the next frame with

197
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,319
bigger motion model

198
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,199
then

199
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
we synthesize the content inside roi

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,319
with perspective transformation

201
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,879
which is like this for position shifting

202
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
and heading angle changes

203
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
then we have the attack influencer model

204
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,958
input in the roi box here

205
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,599
this approach outperforms naive eot

206
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
based attack by more than 46 percent

207
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
and also allow us to more directly judge

208
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
the system level attack success during

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
the optimization

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
because

211
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,480
it can translate the model output level

212
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,839
changes to system level

213
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,360
the last challenge is about the

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
objective function design we need to

215
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
design something specific for changing

216
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
lane line shapes and also make it

217
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
differentiable

218
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,040
due to the time limit i will only talk

219
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,279
about the high level idea

220
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
basically the key idea is to maximize or

221
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
minimize the derivatives of each

222
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,600
waypoint

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
as the derivatives can be seen as a

224
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,480
stereo angles when the vehicle can

225
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,040
follow the waypoint strictly

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
which thus can be a differentiable

227
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
surrogate loss function for lateral

228
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
control level changes

229
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
we call this lane bending objective

230
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
function

231
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,160
and more details are in our paper

232
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
combining all three designs we generate

233
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,959
the patch by alternatively updating the

234
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,680
patch on the bigger trajectory there are

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
a lot of more details behind this please

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
refer to our paper

237
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
we perform the evaluation from various

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,839
aspects for example using real-world

239
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,640
traces vintage skill physical was set up

240
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,279
and simulation setup as i demonstrated

241
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,240
before

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,800
and also combined with the baseline and

243
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
still serious with the user study

244
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
our attack is shown to be effective in

245
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
this various evaluation setup with less

246
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,720
than one second success time

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,560
from the user study

248
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,959
the patch is stealthy from the driver's

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,320
view due to the time limit please refer

250
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
to more detail in our paper

251
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
we also evolved and discussed possible

252
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
defenses for dna model level defenses we

253
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
avoid 5 popular defenses that are

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
directly applicable

255
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
but none of them can defense against our

256
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,640
attack without having normal driving

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,240
another direction is fusing with html

258
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
however creating and maintaining such

259
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
maps are time-consuming costly and hard

260
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,200
to scale

261
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
which is just explicitly avoided by the

262
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
companies like tesla

263
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
however for the security purpose maybe

264
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
this is necessary

265
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,519
as a short-term mitigation we suggest to

266
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
at least put 30 load or 30-load patch

267
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
into the list of 100 scenarios so that

268
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,440
users are aware of the such limitations

269
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
we checked the alc manuals from 11

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
companies but none of them missed the

271
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
limitation today

272
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
we also conducted responsible 1vt

273
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,160
disclosure we involved 30 companies

274
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
developing alc systems

275
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
and they have replied and started

276
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,959
investigation

277
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,320
in conclusion

278
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
we are the first to systematically study

279
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,680
the security of dn based alc in the

280
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
designed operational domain under

281
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,399
physical world adversarial attacks

282
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,040
we propose a novel attack vector

283
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
overcome various design challenges

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
and perform comprehensive evaluations

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,440
using dial traces simulation and

286
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
physical world setups

287
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,880
we also perform responsible

288
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
vulnerability disclosure

289
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
thank you for joining our talk now i'm

290
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,040
open to questions
