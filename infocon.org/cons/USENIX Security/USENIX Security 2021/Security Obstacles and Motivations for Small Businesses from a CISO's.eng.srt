00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,759
hello usenix my name is flynn wolf

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,960
from the university of maryland

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,280
baltimore county or umbc presenting a

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
paper co-authored with my colleagues

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
adam aviv from george washington

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,199
university and robbie cooper also of the

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,560
university of maryland and baltimore

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,560
county paper is entitled security

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,160
obstacles and motivations for small

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
businesses from a cso's perspective

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,840
so we're interested in looking at small

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
businesses for reasons that are probably

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,520
very familiar they're often noted to be

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
a a large and also very vulnerable

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
population in terms of being unprepared

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
in terms of i.t resources and knowledge

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
about online threats things like hacking

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,920
and data breaches or ransomware

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,360
they're often

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
found to have limited resources for

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,120
recovery from adverse events so the

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,520
outcomes can be very dire

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
we also know that they're increasingly

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
targeted by cyber crime

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,559
so the perspective of csos or chief

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,720
information security officers

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
as advisors to small businesses is

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,600
pretty interesting because they're

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
essentially translating an advanced

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
mental model of those online threats to

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
non-expert small business management

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,119
this also fits into

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,280
ongoing research we've done on

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,119
mental models of

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,799
online threats amongst expert

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
populations

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
so uh we were interested in trying to to

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
answer a couple of questions how do um

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
security expert csos translate their

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
model of risk for non-expert small

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
business management um from the

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
perspective of those csos with direct

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
small business exposure what factors are

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
important to small business security in

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,360
terms of like i.t factors or knowledge

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
and how well

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
are those factors understood

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
security guidance was an important proxy

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
for in this relationship either as

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
evidence for csos to convince small

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
businesses uh or stand in for the

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
guidance of csos themselves um so what

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
what resources are available and how

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
effective are they

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
and also what practices are important to

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
trying to put small businesses onto a

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,639
better footing

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,840
in terms of their i.t security

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
to approach this we began with an

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
exploratory semi-structured

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
interview based study using qualitative

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
methods with a sample of eight small

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
business experienced csos

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
they were private federal and state and

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,040
county level csos who had worked

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
directly with small businesses uh and

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
they told us a number of things

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
some of what you would expect but there

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
was some sort of interesting context in

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
the details um

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
so first of all they they confirmed what

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
you might expect that small businesses

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
were generally very vulnerable

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,319
and unaware about the their i.t security

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,239
risks um

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
csos were somewhat divided however on

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
who was responsible for this whether it

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
was the small businesses not doing

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,319
enough themselves um or whether it was a

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
consequence of i.t being given to the

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
small business sector um that is often

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,800
not configured adequately

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
in terms of that importance or factor of

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,840
guidance um the source mattered a lot

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,720
government uh guidance was was deemed to

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,000
be thorough but sort of impractical uh

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,080
whereas commercial guidance could be

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,920
more

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,159
written in layman's terms easy to use

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,080
but also often was aimed at selling a

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,599
solution

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
and again csos also offered us

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
perspectives on on what practices were

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,399
important

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,720
they also felt that uh small businesses

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
were often reactive um after it was too

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
late security events um a contrary sort

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
of opinion here was that in some cases

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
small businesses because they start out

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
operating uh

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
at spark at starbucks and on airplanes

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,200
basically using uh public wi-fi and open

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
source tools and things like that that

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
they might learn from the get-go to be

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
more cautious uh but often that's not

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
the case um

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
it was also found that small businesses

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
might receive improvements sort of

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
incidentally through it upgrades they

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,519
might be motivated

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,239
by

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
uh from without by regulation and their

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
domain um

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,519
and also again that there are

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
limitations in what they can learn from

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,040
security guidance depending on the

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
source

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,918
and also contractual obligations were

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
sometimes a motivating factor but that

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
effect could be limited

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
um

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
we sought to uh extend this our

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
understanding of those themes in a

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
larger study so we carried out

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
structured interviews which i'll talk a

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
little more about the

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
how those questions were

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
set up in a moment

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,520
we recruited a non-overlapping sample of

130
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
19 csos

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
i'll note that it was a challenging

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,479
recruitment process

133
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,560
csos can be kind of guarded

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,199
in general and as you might expect and

135
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
also trying to filter for direct small

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
business experience and avoiding

137
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
regional sampling effects and things

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,479
like that made this quite difficult

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,759
there were some demographic

140
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,320
characteristic characteristics

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
unfortunately it trended

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
largely male

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
favorably however they it was a well

144
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
qualified sample in terms of their

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
experience with network security

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,360
and they also on average had worked

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
most recently with a company of about 44

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
employees

149
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,479
which meant that they had a good direct

150
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,120
experience with resource constraint

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
examples and things like that which made

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
for some interesting context

153
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
so again we chose a number of themes

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
from the first study

155
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,880
including the motivations that small

156
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,479
businesses might identify with for

157
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,199
making improvements um what what

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,280
resources they might use to learn about

159
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
uh security factors uh what they

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,560
understood about those factors

161
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
how those sources of that guidance might

162
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
make a difference on what they uh took

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,039
away from it and also there's just the

164
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,000
the factors that were um influences on

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
on small businesses when it came to

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
making improvements um we we put those

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
themes forward first of all as a prompt

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,319
and asked

169
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,240
study two csos to respond in terms of

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,479
their sentiment and also to discuss it

171
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,600
we then

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
carried out inductive thematic coding of

173
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,240
that discussion uh the paper presents

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
both types of data i'm gonna focus for

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
time here

176
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,919
on the thematic conclusions

177
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,720
so

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,919
first of all in terms of those

179
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,520
motivations for i.t improvements

180
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
obviously csos and study two confirmed

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,520
as you might expect that small

182
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
businesses

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
were suffering from a lack of resources

184
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,560
and a lack of knowledge about what

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
needed to be done to protect themselves

186
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,199
better

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,560
and again there was sort of a divided

188
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
view on the responsibility for this on

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
the one hand small businesses might be

190
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
focused on short-term profitability but

191
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,319
also when they did make investments

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,680
often

193
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
the software that the csos were

194
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
preparing

195
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,639
for small businesses was often found to

196
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,440
be poorly configured out of the box

197
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
uh

198
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
small businesses also might

199
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
be motivated or enabled by other things

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
including it upgrades or hopefully

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
contracting with vendors for cloud-based

202
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
software as a service

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,880
tax incentives were noted all although

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
they were largely unfamiliar

205
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
it was noted particularly that small

206
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
businesses might be influenced by news

207
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
reports about hacking uh events and also

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
by fear of of in their local business

209
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
community not being perceived as a

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
victim

211
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,479
again that relationship to guidance was

212
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,840
found to be very important but it

213
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
depended a lot on the source government

214
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,919
guidance could be

215
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,039
lengthy and hard to parse

216
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
when cso noted you might not know what

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,240
the protocols you're reading actually

218
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
mean until you're audited

219
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,479
others described it in very colorful

220
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,639
colorful terms about it being uh

221
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
brutality to read and so on um on the

222
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
other hand commercial guidance was noted

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
um that you often again had to parse um

224
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
a sales motive in what you were reading

225
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
which which made for extra work and

226
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
interpretation

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,000
um in terms of formats for

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,800
education and security practices there

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
were some interesting observations that

230
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
were offered um practices like

231
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
checklists were found to be very

232
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
important and commonplace but also could

233
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
be limited their brevity on the one hand

234
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
made them easy to carry out but it could

235
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
also make the intent of the checklist

236
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
hard to interpret

237
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
team-based exercises again could bring

238
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,160
to life

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,120
concepts for both i.t and

240
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
management

241
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
but also if they were

242
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,479
not grounded in reality they could be

243
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
kind of a

244
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
costly and ineffective in terms of a

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
learning process

246
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,399
so um based on those thematic

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
conclusions we were able to derive some

248
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,800
some interesting suggestions um about

249
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
practices that can help small businesses

250
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
so first of all we were um talking just

251
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
now about checklists so um

252
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,920
again the brevity could

253
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
could be counter productive so there

254
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
were some suggestions about

255
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
how to counteract that

256
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,640
so essentially providing more context

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
footnotes if you will

258
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
in that kind of a

259
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,160
guidance structure providing examples

260
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
and references so the intent behind

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
actions is clear it's also noted that

262
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
small businesses often can't afford to

263
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
do everything so providing a basis for

264
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
prioritization and checklist actions

265
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,120
could be helpful

266
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,680
similarly uh small businesses often you

267
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
know they can't spend the money they

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
don't have so uh sort of timing of uh

269
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
guidance given to small businesses was

270
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,000
important um in terms of short-term

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
business processes trying to get ahead

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
of

273
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
it security issues by interjecting them

274
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
into preparation for things like hiring

275
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,760
and making upgrade purchases um also in

276
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,880
in longer term processes um trying to

277
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
interject security messaging to uh

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,959
management uh

279
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
after tax projections annually are

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
complete and the company knows what they

281
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,959
have to spend um in longer term

282
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,560
investment cycles but the second or

283
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
third round company may have

284
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
settled a little bit and know what again

285
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,760
they have to spend on on security

286
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
improvements and also after product

287
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
delivery when the company may be looking

288
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,640
to

289
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
again make internal investments it's

290
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
also noted that small businesses may be

291
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
acclimated to considering emergency

292
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
planning for commonplace things like

293
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,160
fires

294
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,000
or natural disaster

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,680
and that i.t improvements for things

296
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
like data backups and recovery can be

297
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
folded into that

298
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
it was also noted that small businesses

299
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
are often overwhelmed at the start when

300
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
they're looking for guidance so labeling

301
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,560
guidance

302
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
that's being offered to them in terms of

303
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
things like i.t experience that's

304
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
required to use the guidance the it

305
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
resources or the business domain that

306
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,440
might be specific to the guidance can

307
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
help them

308
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
parse that search

309
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
and again supporting prioritization of

310
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,959
the items in the guidance could make it

311
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
easier to interpret

312
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
again team-based exercises were reviewed

313
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
as an important learning practice

314
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,240
but there were some factors that could

315
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,519
help them

316
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
be more effective and worth the

317
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
investment

318
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
so again vertically integrating

319
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
management i.t so they can witness each

320
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,240
other's decision-making and learn from

321
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,120
that and also particularly grounding the

322
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
scenarios in the team-based exercises

323
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
very closely in the financial specifics

324
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
of the business

325
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
and the business domain that applies to

326
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
that business were very important in

327
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,240
making the practice worthwhile

328
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,320
so i'll stop there and thank you for

329
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
your time

330
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,880
questions are welcome thank you
