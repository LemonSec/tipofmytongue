1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
hello i'm gingerly from the university

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
of wisconsin madison today i'm glad to

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
talk about our work later which is a

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,520
real compressive protection system for

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
eye checking applications

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
so first what is ios king and why should

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
we care about iot key nitrating the

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
user's eye gas location or attention is

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
being checked continuously on a visual

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,119
scene by vision cameras for example when

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
you are visiting vancouver virtually for

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,000
using this conference

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
the isokin is an emerging human computer

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,280
interface and it is equipped with a lot

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
of rising mixed reactive platforms such

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,760
as microsoft polylines

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
the ihk enables hands-free interaction

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
between the human and the machine

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,440
the applications include

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
social avatar for video rendering event

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,800
triggering and so on that can improve

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,280
the user's experience in mixed reality

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,280
so what's the concern of using eye

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,680
tracking data before going to the detail

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
i would like to talk about some

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,760
backgrounds about itching data

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,240
the ips data is essentially a streaming

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,439
data type of timestamp location tuples

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,360
and the region of interest on a video

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
thing such as the web elements can

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,720
attract human eye gas attention

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,680
the aggregate data is characterized into

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,240
two major types of events the first one

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,880
is the fixation which is a cluster of

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
concentrated eigens that represent the

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,159
human tension

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,159
and the second one is the second which

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,400
are greatest travelling rapidly from one

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
fixation to the next

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,280
so what's the concern here actually the

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,000
icy clean data is telling us information

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
more than necessary

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
this could be exploited by the attacker

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
by looking at the spatial distribution

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,320
of absolute gate's position on certain

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
visual scene for example by looking at

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
this eye tracking heat map on this web

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
page the hacker could learn the user's

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,159
implicit interest

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,920
also the tiger could exploit the

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
aggregate statistic of distribution of a

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
gas or the features of eiges over time

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,720
for example the second event

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
and this can enable the modeling of the

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
user and makes a lot of psychological

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
and physiological change the

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
psychological change include the user

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,520
interest inclusivity and the cultural

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
background and also personality traits

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
and etc

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
this could enable the precision

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
advertisement even without a user's

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
consent

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,599
on the other hand

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,360
the physiological shapes include health

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
conditions such as alzheimer's or vision

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
creation condition also biometric

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
identity and those are really private to

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,879
the user as well

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
so here we know that there's a lot of

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
price concerns or threats when using eye

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
tracking data but still we want to enjoy

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
the real-time utility of igp

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
so

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
how can we have a generalizable action

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
control for to protect the privacy

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,319
however the ec scene designed to protect

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,959
the privacy of itunes data provide no

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
formal guarantee or only allow offline

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
release

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
for example they may rely on the

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
aggregation of all the user's isogame

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,599
features

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
and add noise on the features before

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
releasing the noisy feature to the

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,159
application across the truss boundary so

87
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
this is not suitable for real-time

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
applications

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
therefore we formulate our research

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
question for kaleido that is how can we

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,080
control the privacy while preserving the

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
real-time utility of ishiki

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
here is an overview of kaleidos function

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
the user is interacting with the system

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,560
that collected low streaming eye gaze

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
and caledo will add noise in an online

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,840
manner

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
on the individual against through the

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
law streaming data

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,200
and the creator can relate the noisy

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
extreme elegance across the trans

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
boundary to the application

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
so the application can see the data with

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
the same format as before

105
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
so this will enable the application to

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
offer the real-time utility to the user

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
in parallel

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
so we can enjoy the form of price

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
guarantee on eight strings by local

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
differential privacy in caledo

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,440
and collateral can be seamlessly

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,959
integrated with real-time eye-checking

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
applications in the nowadays ecosystems

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,639
and it's easy to use by automated

115
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,960
privacy configuration

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
how can we define the privacy for

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,800
kaleido

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,840
recall that the format of action data or

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,800
i case data is essentially a location

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
here i'll show an example in 2d

121
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
so the calendar's premise guarantee is

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
focusing on the spatial information of

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
eiges which is a primary source of

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
sensitive attributes and information

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
we develop and leverage a slight

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
variance of the geoe distinguishability

127
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,919
local differential privacy framework

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,240
that has a noisy mechanism to ensure

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
that for all pairs of inputs or gaze

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,680
locations within a certain distance of r

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
which is also the radius of the corki

132
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,600
region that the inputs can enjoy the

133
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,440
indicability with the probability

134
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,919
allowed by the standard privacy epsilon

135
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,960
or the price budget

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
on the other hand

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,039
we're not just focusing on protected

138
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,440
privacy of one single ios

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
the released data format is extremely

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
eye gaze

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
so we are protecting the privacy for the

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
stream

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
how can we achieve that the challenge is

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
we're dealing with a non-deterministic

145
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
exchange in the real-time utility and

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
interaction

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
by leveraging the wbm privacy with the

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
dual distinguishability framework we can

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
protect the spatial distribution of any

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
gate's trajectory from over any sliding

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
window of direction w

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,520
through the infinite stream

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
with the privacy definition in hand how

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,960
do we implement collateral in the real

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
system

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
the calendar has four major blocks the

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
first one is configuration manager that

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
sets the price budget absolute according

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
to the user need as well as the window

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
lens w according to the scene trench

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
frequency in the video stream as well as

162
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
the location indistinguishability radius

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
r according to the spatial

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,840
characteristic of the roi in the

165
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
keyframes and then the count test

166
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
processing code can extract the ri for

167
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
setting the radius r

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
with the pricing parametric configured

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
we have this noisy gates generation

170
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
algorithm that annoys each broker online

171
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
the challenge here is the eye gaze data

172
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
is sampled at a high rate in the real

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
world setting

174
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
so a naive badge allocation for the

175
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
privacy project

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
will harm the utility of the eye

177
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,560
checking data with the dp banner

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
hence by constructing the dp allocation

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,120
algorithm

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
with the semantics of humanities in hand

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
in mind

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,919
we only release the noise noisy eye gaze

183
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,720
when a new fixation is detected in a dp

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
manner

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,720
hence we can preserve the utility of

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,680
ionic data by saving the price budget

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,199
while preserving

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,479
and holding the price guarantee

189
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
then we have the noisy gaze processor

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,919
that allows local post processing such

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
as smoothing before offloading the data

192
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,680
to the untrust applications

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,479
here

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,160
i intuitively show the effect of kaleido

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
against the one without the privacy

196
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,440
enabled

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
using the visualization of eye tracking

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,280
data heat map on the web page

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
we can visually see the differences

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
between different setups with and

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319
without privacy

202
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,520
however

203
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,919
we are also interested in the systematic

204
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,599
evaluation of kaleido in different

205
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,000
focuses the first one is the user

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
perception in real world utility with

207
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
kaleido

208
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
and the second one is impact of

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
collateral on system performance

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,759
and the last one recall that the

211
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,840
coyote's price guarantee is on the

212
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,800
spatial information of gay streams

213
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,039
here we evaluate the effectiveness

214
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,440
against attack that utilize the spatial

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,680
temporal features of iges which are the

216
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
realistic analytics of an attacks in the

217
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
reverse

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,479
setting

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
we are interested to see how our press

220
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,879
guarantee translates to the

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
effectiveness against the real world

222
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,720
text

223
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
first we show our setup for the user

224
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,840
study

225
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
here we consider that the actual kingdom

226
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,479
is a good example to yet evaluate the

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
perception in the real world

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,519
hence we construct our ig king gangs

229
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,120
with kaleido using unity

230
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,160
the game

231
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
in the game the user's target is to take

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,560
down the zombie rapid using the laser

233
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
beam and and direct by the eye gaze due

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
to the cov19 constraint we can start a

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,880
remote user study with the pc webcam eye

236
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
tracking game approved by our irb

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
and we recruit 11 users each with a

238
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,600
study session about 35 minutes in total

239
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
we have five private settings invalid in

240
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
a normalized and randomized order except

241
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
for the controller setup where we allow

242
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
the users to change their price setting

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,000
during the gameplay

244
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,120
to evaluate perception results we first

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
asked the user to report their

246
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
subjective enjoyment level for the game

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
with different settings and then we

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
record game score or the numbers of

249
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,920
graphics

250
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
taken during the game for each user

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
so from the result takeaway is we

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
observe a negligible experience

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
degradation with low privacy setup

254
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,959
even with high price setup title pose

255
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,760
minor impact on the user's perception

256
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
and the game performance

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
how about the system impact

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
we use a commodity pc platform to run as

259
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
q collateral

260
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,640
here comparing to the context processing

261
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
the noising step of collateral takes

262
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
negligible latency the context

263
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
processing include the keyframe

264
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
detection and the ri detection on the

265
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,000
keyframe using neural network

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
but the performance is not degraded

267
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,519
greatly even at a really frequent

268
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,440
context update rate of 8 hertz

269
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,839
then how about the effectiveness against

270
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
spatial temporal features attacks from

271
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
user interest and biomachine first we

272
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
can start attack on user interest using

273
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,399
the data set of pc i shooting for

274
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
viewing 30 unique images each set with

275
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
at least 19 users

276
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
the goal is to identify the users with

277
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
distinct attention partners per image by

278
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
clustering or outlay detection

279
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
the conclusion from here is the

280
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
attacker's success is brought to random

281
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,160
guests at high frequency settings

282
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
high privacy settings even low privacy

283
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
setting towards category

284
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
on the other hand how about the

285
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
biometric text the data side we're using

286
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
here is the vr action data set during

287
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
video sessions for 12 unique videos with

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,399
multiple users

289
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,600
and we are

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
set attacker to identify the user trace

291
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
by classified random biometry features

292
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
in unseen sessions with kaleido

293
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
to learn their balance identity as well

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
as the vision correction condition the

295
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
takeaway is the attacker's success

296
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,480
export to rental gas again even with low

297
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
privacy configuration for both

298
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
trades

299
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
to conclude kailedo is the first system

300
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
to protect the privacy of real-time

301
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,760
eye-checking

302
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,839
and by deploying differential privacy we

303
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,279
can leverage and we leverage the

304
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,160
semantics of eye gaze so that kaido can

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
be seamlessly integrated with existing

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,760
eye checking ecosystems

307
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
