1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,000
welcome i'm lia a phd student from

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,559
indiana university bloomington an

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,080
institute of information engineering cis

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
i'm presenting today our study on the

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
work of understanding and discovering

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
attacks on ethereum decentralized

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
applications

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,640
first of all i'd like to introduce the

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,119
background of eastern eastern is a

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,440
public blockchain based distributed

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,760
computing platform it's just like

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
commuter programs on the blockchain on

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,040
usrim there are two types of accounts

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
externally owned accounts we call it as

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
eoa that controlled by private keys and

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,800
contract accounts controlled by code

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,079
which are known as smart contracts

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,680
issuing the apps are public

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,480
decentralized applications that interact

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
with easing block team providing

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,359
services such as gambling online voting

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,960
token system

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,280
the apps use a set of smart contract as

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
its on-chain backhands will also have

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
option all components

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,920
as the largest dm market israel has

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,799
faced quite a few high impact tax on the

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
apps resulting in millions of dollars

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
losses

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,759
in our research we consider ms krantz

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
who launched attacks on isram bs for

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,439
profit

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
the missed clients conduct several types

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
of attacks on the app's contract by

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
calling smart contracts

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,960
such as exploding with randomness or

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
performing integer overflow and the flow

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
to manipulate money transfer

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
online statistics showed that till

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
november the 5th 2019

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,159
more than 3000 the apps on each room are

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
selling 63 000 active users every day

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,479
containing 1 million transactions that

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,079
involve over 7 million us dollars in our

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,520
study ms krantz took 14 000 users from

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
the victim formal 3d app with this

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
right the community's understanding

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,760
about the new type of cyber crimes is

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
still very limited to the best of our

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
knowledge no extensive francis analysis

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,840
and they have an attacks ever been

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
reported so we started by wondering to

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,239
find out what like and how the attacks

54
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
launched on real world the apps how to

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
automatically reconstruct the app tags

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
how to find new attacks and zero day

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
victim d apps

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
to answer those research questions in

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,160
our research we found that while the app

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
be exploded or francis evidence such as

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,440
attack traces will be kept in related

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
transactions which can later be used to

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
analyze a type

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,959
during interim operations the eastern

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
blockchain treats every constant which

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,239
is recorded in a transaction a

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
transaction is a same data package which

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
carry multiple fields like 2 from value

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,599
etc

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
during all transaction a contract is run

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
by the using viral machine the contract

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
may communicate internally with other

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,920
eos and contracts

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
to understand what data has been

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
modified or what external contracts have

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
been invoked the transaction execution

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,200
can be retraced via re-executing

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,000
transactions under all historical states

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,480
for example in this figure a country

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
country's transaction includes nine

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,360
execution traces which is sent from 0x73

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
to call the function sql as a content of

83
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
0x504

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,480
the transaction has triggered a set of

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
execution traces such as an internal

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
call agile port which is a vulnerable

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
functions

88
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,080
here we elaborate the design

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
implementation for methodology that it

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
turns extends limited information from

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,000
technic blocks and reports to tens of

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
thousand transactions related to a time

93
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
incidence and further analyzer type

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,799
operations

95
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
our approach first reconstruct

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
real-world user df incidents from

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
technic blocks news posts and security

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
reports

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,639
extract all transactions eos and exploit

100
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
contracts

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
then to understand attack operation

102
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
operations related to the explore

103
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
transactions we model execution

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
behaviors using their execution traces

105
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,400
and further determine their operational

106
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,560
semantics by clustering the explorer

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
transactions based upon the similarity

108
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
and timings

109
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,080
more specifically we review these

110
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,639
incident reports to identify immutable

111
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,840
attack related information at sea site

112
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,720
including victim deaf addresses exploit

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440
control addresses attacker eos and

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
exploit transaction hashes in this way

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,919
we identify 42 the apple tank incidents

116
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,440
which inconsist 77 exploit transactions

117
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
we look into all transactions to

118
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
reconstruct the reporting incidents

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,639
which were issued by attacker eos or

120
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,039
exploit contracts to interact with the

121
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
victim d-apps

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,520
we extended a data set with 58 550 file

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
transactions

124
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
before coming to the details of our

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
findings first summarize the footprints

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,520
of a typical diaper time which consists

127
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,560
of four stages attack preparation

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
exploitation attack propagation and

129
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,800
mission completion

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
in the attack preparation stage a dhab

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
attack starts with several transactions

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,320
calling the victim dm from supply

133
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,360
developers to test exploit codes

134
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
meanwhile we observe that money managers

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,320
transfer attack costs into the exploit

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
contracts

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
this is done through money meals to

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
conceive the manager's eos

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
then in the exploitation stage multiple

140
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
time operators involve the exploit

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
contracts to attack the victim of the

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,479
app and gain profit

143
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,800
after the attack in the type propagation

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
stage we found that the operators at the

145
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,759
reuse of further adjust the exploit

146
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,400
contract to explore other similar diaps

147
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
during the mission condition stage the

148
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
tige operators destruct the exploit

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
contracts and withdraw a tight profits

150
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
below we elaborate our measurement study

151
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
and forensics analyze on real-world

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
diaper tags

153
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
in the preparation stage we found that

154
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
the tiger transactions mainly sold to

155
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
purpose

156
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
first testing the exploit contracts and

157
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,160
the second transferring funds to

158
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
bootstrap their attacks

159
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,039
as an example i've seen the figure

160
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,280
before attacking the vulnerabilities in

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
the two formal 3d functions the tiger

162
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
created two test contracts to evaluate

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
air drop port and contract creation

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,400
functions

165
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
apparently the adversary performed his

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,160
own software integration testing

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
in this way we found such appropriation

168
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
stage exists in 85

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
of an attack incident

170
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,840
with average 23 transactions

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,400
in exploitation stage the adversary

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,360
tends to rapidly involve his strategies

173
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
during take

174
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
for example in the bed running but

175
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
random needs attack on formal 3d the

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
first explorer version simply created

177
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
mining new contracts to predict the

178
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
function's output using the block

179
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
information and the public logic of

180
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
their job in order to improve the first

181
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,720
version the second one evaluating

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
existing contract blocks and utilize a

183
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
contract on the winning blocks to

184
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
generate a temporary contract to trigger

185
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
air job so as to save the cost for

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,639
contract creation

187
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,280
in the last wording so the wall street

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
collects all information from existing

189
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
contracts and makes the prediction

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
option before combining the most

191
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,639
compromising contract to invoke airdrop

192
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,199
given this new cyber strike intelligence

193
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
discovers we build a detection tool

194
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
differ to find new attacks including

195
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,440
those on zero-day victim dfs

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,919
defer used a sequence of transactions

197
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
and operations to recover a tight

198
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,559
footprint and determine the stage of

199
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,839
exploit

200
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
different includes two components

201
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
pre-processing and sequence based

202
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
classification

203
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
preprocessing automatically extends the

204
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,440
site to include those indirectly related

205
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,160
to the bi and then cluster the similar

206
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,839
transactions

207
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
operational intent sometimes consists of

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,519
several transactions from multiple eoas

209
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
to find the transaction clusters and the

210
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,800
same operational context we utilize the

211
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
algorithm described as a function to

212
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
group the transactions

213
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
transactions with similar execution

214
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
traces or happen within a small time a

215
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,560
clustered

216
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,279
for each sequence of transactions we

217
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,680
propose a novel in binding technique to

218
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
convert the sequence into a feature

219
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
vector that captures a lighting intent

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
of sequence

221
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,560
those vectors are then go through a s

222
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
model to analyze the relation between

223
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,399
the vectors

224
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,880
then a multi-layer perceptual classifier

225
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,360
model outputs attack stage they belong

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,640
to

227
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
the transaction execution can be too

228
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
df-specific and noisy to capture the

229
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
operational intent

230
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
since the execution trace may contain

231
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
mining operations that happen inside the

232
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,120
app for example invocation of the deaf's

233
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
internal libraries

234
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
to address this issue we employ an eoa

235
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
deaf execution attention model to

236
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
highlight the useful information related

237
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,760
to the eos intent under the app

238
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,480
we evaluate differ over the ground trust

239
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
data side built by ourselves defer shows

240
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
a microprocession of 98

241
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,240
and micro recall for 98

242
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
we collected 104 popular dfs and their

243
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
corresponding contract addresses

244
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
different inspected these transactions

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,079
and label four hundred thousand of them

246
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,240
with one of the tax stages

247
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
these transactions are related to

248
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
attacks

249
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
eighty five week team dfs

250
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
for each week in the app we randomly

251
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
sample four percent of the reported

252
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
transactions

253
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,680
in total we manually investigated four

254
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
hundred thousand transaction clusters

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and get a micro precision of 91 percent

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
this table summarize our findings our

257
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
study reveals that either the abs

258
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
attacks are indeed prevalent

259
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,680
compromising various kind of de-absolute

260
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
different attack vectors

261
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
finally to summarize we did the first

262
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,079
measurement study and francis analyzed

263
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,480
on real world diabetics our new

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
understanding and cyberstroke

265
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
intelligence guideward can help mitigate

266
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
the strategy apps

267
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,680
running deeper on 140 apps we were able

268
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,040
to discover 400 000 exploit transactions

269
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
on 80 file targets

270
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,079
in particular reported 70 failed zero

271
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,640
day victim apps

272
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
