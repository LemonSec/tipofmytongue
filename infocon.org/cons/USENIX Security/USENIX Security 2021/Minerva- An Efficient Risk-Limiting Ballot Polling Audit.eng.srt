1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
hello thank you for joining um i'm going

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,280
to talk about minerva and efficient risk

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
limiting about polling audit and this is

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,199
joint work uh

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,680
uh with grant mclaren uh sarah morin and

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
neil mcburnett and poor vivora i'm

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,519
philipp zagorski

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,279
um i'm gonna briefly talk about risk to

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,119
meeting counties in general and then i

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,240
will focus my your attention to bravo

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,040
and then we'll go and talk about minerva

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,239
um

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
there are many different uh voting

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,559
technologies uh out there uh some of

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,559
them are fully electronic like there is

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,920
machines and most of the internet voting

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,039
solutions

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,640
there are some hybrid

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,320
and fortunately most of the

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,160
voting systems use paper ballots

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,239
but because

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
paper ballots uh and about design can be

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,960
really uh complicated um

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,720
even if uh uh bouts are cast uh and

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,840
marked by uh by my hand um voters

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,080
um these bottles are scanned and telled

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
by computers uh so we are back

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
in a computer security uh problem um

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
because we cannot be sure if bulbs are

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,840
tell it correctly uh so certification is

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
of course not an answer uh because what

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
is important uh is we should focus our

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
attention on uh evidence-based elections

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,119
so we should be

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,520
interested in

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,439
in the correctness of results so we

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,479
should also ask a question uh

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,439
if a scanning or tiling machine uh

39
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
runs correctly on election night not at

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
the time when it was certified

41
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
and the accounting mistakes uh

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,280
can have different sources uh it can be

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
uh backs it can be configuration orders

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,479
or

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,920
it can be a result of hacking so uh what

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
everyone should do is

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
everyone should focus on

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,598
uh

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,280
performing post-election tabulation

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
audits um and uh

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
to do it even in a slightly better way

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,920
uh to focus on our risk emitting audits

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
so recently meeting audis are a post

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
tabulation outlets

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
that manually check random sample

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,319
of uh

57
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
voter's bullets uh so you need to start

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
from a reliable uh voter verified paper

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,519
trade so just after election results are

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,040
announced uh

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
and you start your audit what you do is

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
you sample ballots at random and then

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,239
basically what you do is you check if

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,720
sample is statistically similar to the

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,400
announced tally

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
and your audit can stop and say yes um

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
it is similar so the tally is correct

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
and then you stop without it

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
but you can say no uh it's incorrect and

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,319
in that case you proceed to uh complete

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,120
hand count uh or you can say um i don't

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
know yet uh

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
and in this situation you just draw uh

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
some more samples so you go back to

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
step number two

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,080
risk limiting audits uh have a very nice

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,519
property

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
and rla has a known chance of correcting

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
the reported outcome if the reported

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,040
outcome is wrong so if you set a risk

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,319
limit to 5

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
then if outcome is wrong

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
then there is a 95

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,720
chance that the rla will detect that

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,920
so i will briefly say about the

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
model and notation that we will use uh

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
here so uh and we will focus our

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,360
attention on two candidates uh so we

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
have just only two candidates and we

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,560
have one declared winner um but this

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
everything what i'm going to say is

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,560
easily extended to multiple candidates

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
or winners

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,959
uh so let w be a true winner a wa

95
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,200
announced winner p is announced

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
fractional tally for

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,839
wa so a p is from one half uh

98
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,918
to one uh h0 is now hypothesis um it is

99
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,320
the closest possible incorrect outcome

100
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,960
which is uh that there was a tie between

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
these two candidates so there is no

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
winner and

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
h a is the alternate hypothesis that

104
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
the election outcome is correct

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
um

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,560
x is the entire

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,919
sample drawn so far xj is entire sample

108
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,800
drone up to jtround

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,759
and a is the statistical test

110
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
and we focus here our attention on on

111
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
one

112
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
type one error

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
and this is uh the case when uh the test

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,440
says that everything is fine uh while uh

115
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
the underlying uh

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
sample comes from the

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,639
uh

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,520
tight uh distribution and then this is

119
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,639
the problem

120
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
um we can also uh compare different

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,800
tests and consider also a type two error

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
and then it influences the

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
efficiency um but we don't have time

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
for that so uh

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,560
an audit a is a risky meeting with risk

126
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
limit alpha if and only if uh

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,240
probability of missing uh the correct uh

128
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,199
answer is less than of

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
uh i will uh

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,039
use uh

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,320
examples to explain uh our work uh so uh

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
for this presentation we will have uh

133
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
the situation when the announced winner

134
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,080
uh won with 75 percent uh of all votes

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,919
cast and we will consider a risk

136
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
claiming uh of ten percent

137
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
okay so uh what a risky meeting object

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,479
does uh it uh

139
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,039
you sample some ballots you can mark how

140
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,919
many ballots are for the winner and then

141
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,400
at some point you need to say uh if the

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
sample comes from uh

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,880
from h0 or uh from uh h

144
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
a

145
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
distribution so basically you need to

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,039
you need to say

147
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
in which words you are in um

148
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,720
and then there are different uh ways of

149
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
looking at this or making these

150
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,000
decisions so

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,039
uh one way of doing it uh is is called

152
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,120
bravo and bravo is an rla that was uh

153
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
proposed in 2012 by uh

154
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,759
mark lindemann philippe stark and

155
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
vincent yates um

156
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,318
and

157
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
this is uh the sequential uh

158
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
followed by ballot uh

159
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
sequential ratio uh

160
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,880
test

161
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,039
that is the extension of

162
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,479
classic work of abraham

163
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,440
and

164
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,880
it what it does it

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,680
takes a sample takes a look at where we

166
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
are at

167
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
at a given point of uh

168
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,919
of the something procedure and then it

169
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
compares uh to uh and computes uh ratio

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
of two two probabilities uh so one is

171
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
the probability that uh

172
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
that our observation is uh from the

173
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,080
uh

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
alternate uh hypothesis uh

175
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
here uh or uh

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
uh

177
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
h0 and then the ratio tells us

178
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
where we are and the decision is that

179
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
the ratio should be larger than one over

180
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,039
alpha which is one over the risk limit

181
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,040
so in our case when alpha is

182
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,199
[Music]

183
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
point one uh

184
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
we would need to to wait till the

185
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
situation team uh till we get uh

186
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
this ratio over

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
um ten

188
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,919
okay so uh

189
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,840
we are not successful so we we are in

190
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
this undetermined state and we need to

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
draw uh some more samples and then we uh

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,599
compute this ratio over and over again

193
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,479
um and uh hopefully at some point of

194
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
time uh

195
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
we have enough evidence

196
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,440
uh to confirm that the results are

197
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
exactly as announced

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039
um

199
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
how this can last longer or uh shorter

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
period of time and the interesting and

201
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
important thing is that when the sample

202
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,958
comes not from the announced

203
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,720
distribution but from the type

204
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,839
distribution then usually uh

205
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
uh

206
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,440
out it will never stop and you basically

207
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
do the the the full hand code uh or it

208
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,080
uh when it stops it stops only uh with

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,040
uh

210
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
less than your risk limit

211
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
um

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
so for for bravo everything is uh

213
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
computed so you can you can figure it

214
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,519
out what is the expected number of

215
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
ballots given a given um

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,360
victory margin uh you can say okay uh

217
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
let me if i want to finish with uh

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
ninety percent uh uh cases then given

219
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,040
the

220
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
margin of victory

221
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
i need to to to do uh

222
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,399
on average uh that number of uh

223
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,360
uh this is the my my sample size um but

224
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
the problem uh with uh with this

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
approach is that uh

226
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,080
in fact audits are not done about by

227
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,800
boat uh because you need to go to to a

228
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
box uh then you need to uh

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
pull the the ballot that you uh are

230
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
supposed to to sample and it takes time

231
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,600
so in fact what uh what people do during

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
audits is they don't perform uh

233
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
by ballot they do it round by round and

234
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
then the problem is that when you do it

235
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,680
round by

236
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
round

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,320
um the numbers that you that you have

238
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
from this table that you that you saw a

239
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,760
couple slides back uh are uh are not

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
correct uh so uh you would expect that

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
the number of uh of steps that that you

242
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
need to do in order to finish your

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
outfit

244
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
is smaller than actually what what is

245
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,440
needed so end of round uh bravo uh takes

246
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
a longer time and it has completely

247
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,839
different probabilities of stopping than

248
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,360
uh the original

249
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
bravo

250
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
okay so you lose expected probability of

251
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,240
stopping and you

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
you need to sample much more balance

253
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
so we came up with a

254
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
minerva and minerva um

255
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
takes a slightly different approach and

256
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
it doesn't compare uh the probabilities

257
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
of being exactly at that given point but

258
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
it takes into account uh let's say area

259
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,360
uh that we are at a given point and or

260
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
above and we also take into account this

261
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
ratio so the ratio that uh let's say

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
after something 36 ballots

263
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
and we have at least 25 for the winner

264
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
we compute this probability and then we

265
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,640
divide it by

266
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
uh by the probability uh from from this

267
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,279
distribution and if uh

268
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
if this ratio is above our threshold

269
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,360
then we then we stop the audit and

270
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,160
and we are good

271
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
this gives us

272
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,640
efficiency boost so minerva takes on

273
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
average

274
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
much

275
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
less bullets than end of round bravo and

276
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
also fewer bullets than uh

277
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,480
original bravo

278
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,839
um

279
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,600
and in fact what we've uh what we've

280
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
chosen what with what we've

281
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,040
showed was

282
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
the following we've

283
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
presented

284
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
that ballot by ballot decisions in

285
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
round-by-baron procedures are

286
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,560
inefficient and then we showed that

287
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
minerva is risky meeting uh

288
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,320
is at at least as efficient as end of

289
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,959
round bravo or selection order bravo uh

290
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,240
we also provide open source uh software

291
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
uh pilot rla of primaries uh was

292
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
performed in montgomery county ohio in

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
may 2020 by mark lindemann

294
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
and minerva is integrated with

295
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
voting works

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
that's the

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
open source

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,760
vote auditing software from

299
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
arlo

300
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,160
thank you very much
