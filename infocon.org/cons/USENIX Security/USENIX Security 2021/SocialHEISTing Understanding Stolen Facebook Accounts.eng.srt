00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,519
hello

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,920
i'm jeremiah nolapo from the university

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,280
of vermont

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,679
and i'll be presenting our work

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,560
on

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,600
stolen facebook accounts to you

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
this is for the 2021 use next security

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
symposium

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,840
as we all know

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
social accounts often display

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920
demographic attributes such as age

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
gender location

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
and so many others

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
and over time

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
the value of social accounts actually

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
rises because a lot of interesting

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
content accumulates in there

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
including personal information

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
and demographic attributes and sensitive

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
information

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
in social accounts can be abused by

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
malicious parties in fact

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
such content has been abused by

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
malicious partners

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,320
our goal in this work is to understand

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,360
the influence of demographic attributes

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,240
such as the ones i mentioned previously

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
on attacker behavior installing social

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,600
accounts

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,799
now that must be done without harming

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
any real users

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
i want to note here that this is

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
different from a general understanding

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,479
of attacker behavior in stolen accounts

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
in this study we focus specifically on

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,960
the influence of demographic attributes

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,119
on the behavior of criminals

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,479
in other words

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
when criminals connect to accounts

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,320
how do the demographic attributes of the

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
accounts the compromised accounts

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,360
influence the behavior of attackers

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,200
in such accounts

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
so uh we start by creating and

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
populating fake accounts otherwise known

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
as honey accounts

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
now why fake accounts

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,399
well as i mentioned before studies like

49
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
this must be carried out without harming

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,399
any real users

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,399
instead of using real accounts that

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
belong to real people we use fake

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,560
accounts instead

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
but then we populate those fake accounts

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
otherwise known as honey accounts

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
with data to the point

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,680
at which those planning accounts look

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
realistic and then we set up a system

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
otherwise known as the monetary

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,200
infrastructure to observe what happens

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
within those accounts

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
we leak credentials that point to those

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,280
honey accounts

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,480
at venues where criminals are known to

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
leak

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
credentials

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
and then we record and analyze data that

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
accrues from the honey accounts

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
and then shed light on the behavior of

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,640
criminals within stolen accounts

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
now this is an overview of our system

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,840
so before uh describing the monitor

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
infrastructure itself i want to talk a

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
bit about dyi archives in facebook

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,599
accounts

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,400
now each facebook account has this

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,159
feature known as dyi which stands for

78
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,720
download your information

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
now this archive contains a record of

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,200
activity within each account

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
so each account has one and uh

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,920
the dyi archive a contains information

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,280
for example about timeline posts

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
uh including the content of such posts

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
and the time they were created and so on

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
uh so at the end of experiments we

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
download the dyi archives of all the

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
accounts

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
and analyze that data offline

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,400
also uh we

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
set up a mail server

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
to receive email email notifications

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
from the facebook accounts that was set

94
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
up now such email notifications get sent

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,040
for example when someone tries to change

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
the password of an account so the

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,319
account automatically sends out

98
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
an email about password change

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
so we set up more than a thousand

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
realistic facebook accounts

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
and uh we distributed evenly the age and

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,479
gender demographic attributes

103
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
across those accounts

104
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,759
as i mentioned before we populated the

105
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
accounts with realistic data and we

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
sourced the data publicly so we used

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
publicly available data no private data

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
was involved in this process

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
to lure criminals into interacting with

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
the accounts

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,720
we linked credentials

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
pointing to to thoughts of the accounts

113
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
on the surface web and the dark web

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
so we linked those credentials on paste

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,919
sites

116
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
uh at those uh places

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
and then we monitored the accounts for

118
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
six months

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,919
so what did we observe

120
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
in total we observed more than 300

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
unique accesses

122
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,320
with

123
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
records of cookies which are unique

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
identifiers

125
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,759
now those accesses were observed in more

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
than 200 accounts

127
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
and those accesses resulted in more than

128
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
a thousand actions

129
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
now there are various types of actions

130
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,120
where you consider facebook accounts

131
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
in this work we labeled those actions in

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,840
different ways

133
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
for example if an attacker logs on to an

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,080
account and then does nothing afterwards

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
we leave out that as a curious action if

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
another attacker

137
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
logs onto an account

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
and uses the facebook search bar to

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,160
search for terms of interest we leave

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
out that as a searcher action

141
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
if another attacker logs on to some

142
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
facebook account

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
and

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
writes a message for example a private

145
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,199
message to another account

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,960
then we label that as a chatty action

147
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,240
and we observe that curious searcher and

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
chatty activity

149
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
actually dominated the actions table

150
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
now let's talk about the age of uh of

151
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,319
accounts

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,960
so when criminals connect

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
to

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
uh adult accounts in our data set

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,280
they

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
do more of adding and removing of

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
friends than they do when they connect

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,319
to teen accounts

159
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,160
on the other hand when they connect to

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,520
team accounts they do more profile

161
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,160
editing in those accounts than they do

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
in adult accounts

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
also

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
they do more of chatting and post

165
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,440
creation in teen accounts than they do

166
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
in adult accounts

167
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,400
so this indicates already that there are

168
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
differences

169
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,160
along the age dimension there are

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
differences in the behavior of criminals

171
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,599
depending on the demographic attributes

172
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,240
in the accounts that they preach

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
now let's talk about gender

174
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
we observed that when criminals breach

175
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,440
accounts that belong to women or girls

176
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
they do more of adding than removing of

177
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
friends in such accounts than they do

178
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,039
in mail accounts

179
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,039
interestingly

180
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,000
we observed that when they connect in

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
our data set when they connect to

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
accounts that belong to women or girls

183
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
these criminals don't do any profile

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,879
editing

185
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,520
but they edit the profiles of mail

186
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,120
accounts

187
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,240
also

188
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,599
criminals

189
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
do more of search activity

190
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
in mail accounts than they do in female

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
accounts

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
so having observed those differences we

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,360
went further

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
and constructed graphs

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
from the actions we've observed

196
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
so uh we constructed those graphs from

197
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
the timestamp timestamp information

198
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,479
of the actions we recorded

199
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,280
and uh we'll see

200
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
differences once again

201
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
in

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
the actions the transitions between

203
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,599
actions

204
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,760
in uh the female accounts versus the

205
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,320
mail accounts as we can see here

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
as i mentioned before none of the

207
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,599
funeral accounts recorded profile edits

208
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,200
and that is why we have that

209
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,160
disconnected pro note up there

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
as you can see that is much different

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
from what we observe

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,880
in the mail accounts profile editing

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,800
happens frequently in the mail accounts

214
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,640
so uh

215
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,959
talking about where the accesses were

216
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,680
recorded came from

217
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
we recorded 415

218
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
ip addresses

219
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,279
that connected to the accounts

220
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,000
and those ip addresses originated from

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
53 different countries

222
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
so when we checked those ip addresses

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,440
against lists of torxed nodes we found

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
that 39 of them

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
actually

226
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
were tore exit nodes

227
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
now i must mention at this point that

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
although these ip addresses appear

229
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
to be geographically present in 53

230
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
different countries

231
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
it is possible

232
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
that some of them

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,360
were vpns and proxies so we may not be

234
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
seeing the exact geographical location

235
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
of these ip addresses

236
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,399
having said that

237
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,480
uh we actually plotted out the uh

238
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
locations from which these ip addresses

239
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
showed up and as you can see

240
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
the ip addresses in the united states

241
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
tend to be clustered around the coasts

242
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
the coastal areas

243
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,680
and we see a dense cluster of ip

244
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
addresses from europe

245
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
also india

246
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,560
uh

247
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
we recorded a good number of ip

248
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
addresses from india

249
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
perhaps not too surprisingly we didn't

250
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
record any access from china this is

251
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,519
because

252
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
facebook is banned in china

253
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
so what does all of this actually mean

254
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,680
it means we need to rethink the systems

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,640
that detect and mitigate malicious

256
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
accesses in online accounts and in fact

257
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
we need to

258
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
factor in demographic attributes and

259
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
possibly other attributes

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,279
it's our hope that this work

261
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
will actually constitute a foundation

262
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
on which further work

263
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
in this area will be done

264
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
now talking about ethics we thought very

265
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,160
carefully about ethics while setting up

266
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
this uh project and as a result we used

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,279
test accounts instead of real accounts

268
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,760
we used publicly available data

269
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,079
and we asked our contacts at facebook to

270
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,240
keep an eye on their accounts

271
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
and we obtained ethics approval from our

272
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
institution

273
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,399
and that's it

274
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
thank you very much for listening my

275
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
contact details are as listed on the

276
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,680
screen

277
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,560
i'd also like to thank my co-authors

278
