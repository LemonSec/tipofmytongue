00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,640
the online payment services have become

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
ubiquitous in our daily life however the

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
barrier to injury is quite high for many

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
small business

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,360
first individual payment accounts on

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
this platform are not designed to handle

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
large volume of transactions

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
which incurs configurable delay in

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,079
applications

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,800
lastly is also a non-trivial upfront

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
cost commitment to getting started

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
realizing these limitations a new form

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
of payment management services have

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
emerged to serve as a broker between the

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
buyer and the seller

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,200
we call this new paradigm the personal

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
payment system it covers the personal

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
money transfer functions provided by

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,520
existing third-party cad server with the

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,159
order management platform developed by

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,000
the payments

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
provider itself

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
there are four interest involved in the

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
merchant client

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
where the user brought the merchandise

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
and make orders

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,479
the merchant server that holds the

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,079
client of accountant

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,000
a third-party platform measures the

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
money transactions between different

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,799
accounts

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,880
and their personal payment systems order

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,079
management

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
platform offers commercial payment

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
functionalities

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
the additional of this independent

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
platform in the order and payment

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,360
management process is the unique design

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
in this ecosystem

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
compared to the

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,159
traditional payment systems

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,080
the transactional flow in the personal

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
payment system can be summarized at the

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
right figure

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
a merchant needs to register two

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
accounts one personal account at the

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
third party payment platform and the

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
merchant commercial count as the

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,120
management systems after the buyer place

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
the order the payment information will

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,879
be sent to the cash server while the

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
order information is transmitted to the

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
management platform

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,959
while the whole payment and all the

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
information will be sent to the cash

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,640
server in the traditional third-party

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
platform

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
when the contract payments is made at

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
the test server and monitored by the

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
management platform it will send the

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
notification to the merchant server to

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,840
continue the order

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,000
process next we talk in details about

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
the transaction flows in personal

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
payment systems

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
the enrollment process starts with the

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
initial key distribution a unique case

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
generated for each merchant's account

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
this key is distributed by the merchant

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
account web page

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,519
on the personal payment system website

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,120
after receiving

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
the order request from the merchant card

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
the merchant service will generate the

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200
order package with the detailed

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
information and the token is also

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
calculated using the key with some hash

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
functions

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
the merchant client

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,920
will receive the order sent from the

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,720
merchant server and send this order also

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,280
to the personal management platform

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
this this platform will look up the

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
stored key for the merchant and

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
recalculate the tokens

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
for verifying the integrity of the order

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,400
package

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,319
after that the payment account

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
information such as the qr code of the

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
merchant account is sent to the machine

104
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,519
client

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
then the buyer pays the required amount

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,200
and the management platform keeps

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
monitoring the money flow

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
finally a notification is sent to the

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
merchant server and merchant account

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
management client for further

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,799
application behavior

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
recall that such independent

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
payment management enable the personal

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
money transfer transfer to realize a

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,120
commercial account behaviors however the

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,199
separation of other information and

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,680
monitored payment information leaves the

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
chance for malicious attack

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
first problem is the unprotected key

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
changing api

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
this api allows pre-authenticated

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
requests to change the key

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,759
in most systems this api only requires

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
the motion id the atlas motion id is not

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,960
a secret by design and can be directly

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
obtained by examining the other package

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
in some personal payment systems the new

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
key is included either directly in the

129
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
changing replies using the new key

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,919
attacker can make arm3 modifications

131
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,280
unfortunately the https do not protect

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,199
this attack since the attacker is the

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
party making the request instead of

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
launching the main middle attack

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
in other personal payment systems the

136
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
new kia not directly included in the

137
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
reply the attacker can

138
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,320
frequently

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
call the key checks to disturb the

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
merchant operations to achieve the deny

141
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
of service attack

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
the second problem lies in the

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
vulnerable auto generation with two

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
sub-problems first is the local

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,840
generation which implies that attacker

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
can tamper with some fields

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
of a locally stored order

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
besides to enable the local order

149
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
generation some merchant clients store

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,520
the key in local storage for convenience

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
this allows the attacker to easily

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
obtain the merchant key by reverse

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,479
engineering the merchant client program

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
with this key the acceptor can actually

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
modification modify the order package

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
with a lower price

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,639
the third problem focuses on the package

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,440
signature generation token is generated

159
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,240
by combination all items in the orders

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
with a key into a

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
string and inputting these strings into

162
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
the md5 algorithm

163
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,880
some systems simply combination of field

164
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,520
without any denominators as a result

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
when the surface of one field is shifted

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,479
to the prefix of the next field the

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,800
generated token does not change for

168
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
example we assume the price is 100. in

169
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,440
this attack the attacker modifies the

170
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,560
order package by moving the last 0

171
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,919
to the url the the modified package will

172
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
include a new price of turn while do not

173
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
influence the token calculation

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
the second vulnerabilities is from the

175
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
use of weak md5 hash function

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
the chosen prefix collision attack

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
allows the attacker to change the prefix

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
part of the input but still generated

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
the same md5 output as true in this

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
figure an attacker can modify some of

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
the field in the other package such as

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
the price

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
and the two prefix but still generating

184
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
the same token

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,759
while the generated collision block can

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
be put in some optional fields such as

187
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
the url without influencing the other

188
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,199
json package parts

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,120
the last problem is the vulnerable

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
payment account delivery some systems

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
only display the price on their id in

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
the qr code

193
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
while the order id is the only clue a

194
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,759
buyer can use to associate the payments

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,479
with his item however a long complicated

196
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,960
id is hard for the user to identify his

197
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
order then the attacker can perform the

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
main the middle attack to block the

199
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
order sent from the victim's merchant

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
clients

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,319
and then substitute the other

202
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
information with hits

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
then the big term user will pay for the

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
order but cannot get his purchased item

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
as a summary we focus our analysis on

206
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
the unique design of personal payment

207
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
systems

208
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
as shown in this figure there are four

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
messages as previously described from

210
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
the t distribution

211
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,919
to the nullification

212
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,120
we found six unique vulnerabilities

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
and based on these vulnerabilities we

214
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,759
have also created five proof of concept

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,160
attempts

216
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
next

217
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
we will discuss our empirical study to

218
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
analyze the payment services from the

219
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
personal payment systems our goal is

220
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
twofold first we investigate the usage

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
of personal payment system the second we

222
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
expose their security issues

223
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
first the personal payment systems are

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
currently used in both websites and

225
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,479
mobile apps

226
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
and the web application is the

227
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
best recommended method of deployment

228
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,120
so our study shows that these systems

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
with webpacks have been downloaded over

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
20 thousand times according to the

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
statics from the wordpress and the

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
packages

233
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
besides the data from the personal

234
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
payments website

235
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,920
shows that over ten thousands merchants

236
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,440
and ten and 20 million customers have

237
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
enabled in enrolled

238
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,480
personal payment services

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,399
besides we also found that over 500 apps

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
adopting these systems

241
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
with over two million installations

242
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,279
here we summarize the collected

243
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
aids personal payment system providers

244
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,959
and their vulnerability distributions

245
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,480
to our surprise we can observe that this

246
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
the security vulnerabilities professor

247
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,279
pervasively looked in this new payment

248
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
paradigm to cause a severe real-world

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
issues

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,680
from this figure we can see that

251
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,399
the

252
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
note with the

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
brown colors

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
is the problem that fixed after our

255
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
reported to the provider

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,320
since these possibilities have pervasive

257
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
real-world impact we also conduct the

258
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
case studies to

259
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,560
demonstrate that they will cause real

260
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
world

261
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,519
laws

262
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,600
the first is a string shifty attack we

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,880
will charge

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
30 a month to our registered account on

265
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
the page api website but only pay

266
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
3

267
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
the second is the key changing attack

268
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
we're disabling the merchant services on

269
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,680
the pace api website of our own tested

270
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
account

271
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
and also we can fill in the new key on

272
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
the shim pay website

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
the third is the payment substitution

274
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,480
attack we let the weak team pay turnwear

275
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
on a resource website for the attacker's

276
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
order

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,959
the last is the md5 collision attack we

278
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,480
only pay 0.01 donation amount

279
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
personal payment system in george block

280
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,800
with expected 0.02

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,079
this calculation costed a lot a lot of

282
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
competition resources and also took

283
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,920
seven days to find a feasible collision

284
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,399
from our his study you can see that we

285
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
carefully design and conduct our case

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
study to avoid impact on real world

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
entities during these experiments we

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,320
make use of our test accounts

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
for demonstrating these attacks and

290
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,240
always let the authority to know our

291
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
attack

292
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
besides we reported all our fundings to

293
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,920
the personal payment system providers

294
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,880
and the two supervisor platform in china

295
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
the security response center of transit

296
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,120
and alibaba security response center

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
we hope that our effort can help improve

298
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
the security of mobile payment

299
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,079
ecosystems

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,120
thank you

301
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,160
that is all of our paper

302
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
you
