00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,480
this paper on collective information

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,240
security and large-scale urban protest

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,920
the case of hong kong is co-authored

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,480
with three great people well i'm a

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,560
qualitative social scientist i'm reagan

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
my co-authors are photographers and

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,039
computer scientists martin albrecht

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
jorge blasko and lincoln maricopa

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,800
and

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
the underlying premise of this paper is

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,159
is that in order to design secure

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,120
communication technologies um that meet

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
the needs of people participants in

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,040
large-scale urban protests in our case

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,800
we need to understand what those needs

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
actually are and so this means engaging

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
with people in protest to understand how

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
they use security technologies in these

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,399
settings where these technologies

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,480
succeed and where they fail

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,960
and also how existing technologies are

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,680
appropriated for the social environments

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,280
within which they're being used so this

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
is really kind of what we set out to do

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
in this paper

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,199
so why are we focusing on hong kong well

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,199
the anti-extradition law amendment bill

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,200
protests or the anti-elect protests in

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
2019 and 20 are useful as a case study

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,159
to unearth very specific security needs

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
of protesters for a number of reasons so

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
first these protests were highly

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,159
digitalized

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,320
most activities had additional component

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
in the form of different modes of visual

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
communication and technologies but also

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,720
these protests were highly mobile and

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
this form of mobility uh was partly

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,000
facilitated by digital technology such

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
as for instance measured messaging

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
applications and online forums

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,240
and the process were also seen as

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
innovative in their protest tactics so

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,399
for example the use of the term

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
frontliner to denote someone who is

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
likely to see engagement with law

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,399
enforcement and notions of pop-up

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
protests or flash mods for also a

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
particular innovative approaches

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
um and while it's really important to

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
stress that these that our findings are

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
specific to to the the setting of hong

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,799
kong we know that the tactics that were

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
developed in these protests have also

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
been imitated by protest movements

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
elsewhere such as in india in zimbabwe

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,000
and by blm protesters

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,959
um

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,120
in terms of the methodology for our

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
study we designed it around

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
semi-structured interviews with

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,959
participants in these protests and they

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
were all done online we did interviews

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680
with 11 participants um seven of these

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
had primary process experience which

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
were more or less front liners they were

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
active members of

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
protest groups but online and offline

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
four had secondary experience of protest

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
so they haven't been on the front line

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
but they're still taking part in the

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
protests and our study in terms of

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
ethics was approved for cell

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
certification through the research

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,319
ethics committee of our institution and

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
we designed our study so that it would

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
minimize the collection of personally

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
identifiable information which is

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
absolutely key

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,800
um and finally data was analyzed through

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
inductive

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
and adoptive approach so we coded our

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480
data through three coding cycle using um

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
individual 12 which is qualitative data

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,640
analysis software and then absolutely

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
importantly um about our methodology is

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,319
that it's explorative rather than

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
explanatory so it provides depth rather

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
than scale which was evident from from

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
the table and

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
the types of interviews that we that we

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
did

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,239
so we of course

94
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
set up our set out our research findings

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,440
in the paper as well and i will of

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
course encourage everyone to to read the

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,159
paper but um just to note that the

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,239
quotes that we kind of bring out in this

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,159
presentation i won't read them out but

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
they're illustrative of of wider

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
findings um as well

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,959
and

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
in terms of the tools the protest tools

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
used by our participants they're very

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,799
much dominated by telegram and whatsapp

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,840
um

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
whatsapp in the telegram in particular

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
was seen to give participants more

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
security and key functionality in terms

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
of being able to create both small close

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
groups and large public groups that each

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,200
help very specific uh functions for them

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
which you'll come back to

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,159
and

115
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,000
whatsapp was seen as particularly useful

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,439
because it was already widely used in

117
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,959
hong kong at the start of the protest

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
and therefore enabled participants to

119
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,560
form these small trusted affinity groups

120
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
very early on

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
and then signal while it was mentioned

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,280
by participants it wasn't widely adopted

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
or it wasn't really adopted as part of

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
the protests um

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
because it required phone numbers and

126
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,720
and of course whatsapp also requires

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
phone numbers but because it was widely

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
used by participants before the protest

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
they felt confident and and hence also

130
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
secure using this tool which they were

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,639
already familiar with so signal just

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,120
didn't it wasn't seen to give them any

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
more

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,639
any additional security or required

135
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,639
key functionality

136
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
we also found that participants

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
appropriate different consumer apps to

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,560
meet their specific needs

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,440
a key finding that kind of emerged

140
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
through our data analysis was social

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
organization or

142
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,919
underground organization and it centers

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
on a number of key security requirements

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,120
articulated by the participants

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
so first um in in relation to group

146
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
types two types emerged in in the data

147
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
on the one hand large public groups that

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
were necessary for organizing and

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,639
information sharing as well as

150
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,960
collective decision making and these and

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
then

152
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
secondly these small close-knit affinity

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
groups that were among front-line

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
protesters they were built around trust

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
relations they were established offline

156
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,039
security notions largely depended on

157
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,840
group types so anonymity in the large

158
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
groups which were assumed to be

159
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,919
infiltrated by for example cops

160
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,240
and confidentiality in small close-knit

161
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,199
groups

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,440
and all participants who had primary

163
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
protest experience um in our study spoke

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
of the challenges of onboarding new

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,400
members into these close-knit affinity

166
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
groups and specific

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
strategies were adopted by different

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
groups but they were all grounded in

169
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
offline relations so

170
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
meeting people face to face at the size

171
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
of protests before being accepted into a

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,240
group was key and decisions about group

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
members

174
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
group membership was very much a

175
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
collective one

176
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,919
um

177
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,880
and then finally on social organization

178
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
um for participants uh the ability to

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
make collective decisions on on protest

180
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
tactics was essential um examples

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
include real-time voting in these big

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
telegram channels

183
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
but also collective decision making was

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
a mechanism for ensuring security

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,000
numbers as well as tactical buy-in for

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
future protest activities such as

187
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,759
where to go next

188
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,479
and

189
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,560
for the participants this also meant

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
that group administrators of these large

191
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
public groups on telegram

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
which facilitated collective decision

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
making and also collective security then

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
became anonymous leaders of these

195
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
protests and they often managed several

196
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
accounts at the same time

197
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
and kind of leading on from that um

198
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,720
being able to detect if a group member

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
was arrested was a key functionality and

200
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
a key security requirement um this is

201
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,919
evident throughout the data and through

202
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,520
the tools that

203
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
protests relied upon and also their

204
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
particular monitoring practices which

205
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
while they differed between groups they

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
in general in general um when group

207
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,919
members went out to protest some group

208
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,880
members would stay behind to monitor um

209
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,639
their whereabouts

210
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
and these

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
were all these practices were all aimed

212
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,720
at detecting arrests so groups would use

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
specific specific monitoring apps so

214
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
through whatsapp live location sharing

215
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,960
function other groups would use

216
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
scheduled messages or regular text

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
messages

218
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,560
but the main reason we wanted to detect

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
the rest relate to different

220
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
post-compromised practices as we call it

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
this included rendering legal aid but

222
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
importantly to also to protect group

223
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
members um so this was done through two

224
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
practices um

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
it was done through remote message

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
deletion and also remote removal of

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,319
group members so where where group

228
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,720
administrators of more in one group

229
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
would remove would delete messages and

230
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
remove group members who were suspected

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,680
arrested

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
and then we set out a number of

233
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
discussion points in our paper i'll

234
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,800
focus on two high-level ones here

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,319
firstly

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
collectivity was key in our

237
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,679
findings usable security studies often

238
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,839
focus on individual users and the

239
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
participants in our studies however

240
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
overwhelmingly

241
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,599
noted how security practices were

242
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,519
collective in nature and they

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
demonstrated how information in person

244
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
rests on these collective practices to

245
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
meet the security needs of groups

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
information security is is different

247
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
negotiated between group members um

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
but also linked to this notion of

249
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
collectivity is um is grounding our

250
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240
understanding of security needs in the

251
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,839
specific social settings of distinct

252
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,440
populations so different high-risk

253
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
groups will experience distinct security

254
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
needs that are very much rooted in their

255
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
social environment so

256
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
one of the one of our arguments is that

257
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
we need to move beyond the interview

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
studies like this one and actually

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
employ ethnographic methods

260
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,839
of inquiry for example to understand the

261
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,640
actual security needs through immersion

262
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
in the groups that we we aim to study

263
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
and then

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,279
finally um

265
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
our study also has implications for

266
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
design and that if we want to meet the

267
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,080
security needs of protesters so first

268
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
telegrams empty proto protocol

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,920
particular regard to

270
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
group chats is a pressing

271
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,560
target for cryptanalysis

272
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
second participants in our study rely

273
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,920
heavily on trusted third parties

274
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,959
thirdly

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
a participant's notion of forward

276
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,600
secrecy and post compromise security

277
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
very much different from those in the

278
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
cryptographic literature and of course

279
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
vice versa

280
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,079
and then finally we do set out a number

281
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,959
of

282
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
design goals for secure messaging in our

283
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,519
paper firstly to support

284
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
support for both small private

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,000
groups and large public groups where we

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
have confidentiality in the first one

287
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
anonymity in the second one

288
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
that we avoid personally identifiable

289
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
information such as phone numbers when

290
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
we design secure messaging and also that

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
we allow group administrators to control

292
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
membership and also messages within the

293
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,320
groups

294
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
and we also have a number of broader

295
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
design goals such as for instance the

296
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,440
ability to share live locations securely

297
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
um

298
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
with with members of groups and finally

299
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,959
but importantly um

300
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,120
there are a number of limitations to to

301
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
this study as with with all studies of

302
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
this um

303
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
of this kind of quality and also in

304
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
terms of qualitative studies uh more

305
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,360
generally that we need to take into

306
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
account when we interpret our findings

307
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
so um

308
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,279
do have a look at those in our paper as

309
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
well um as they are important to keep in

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
mind when we when we interpret our

311
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,959
findings

312
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
that's all i have to say so the only

313
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,560
thing left to say is um thank you all

314
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
very much um but in particular thank you

315
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,839
to our participants who gave generously

316
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,680
of our their time

317
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
to engage with this study

318
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,200
so so thanks very much

319
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,959
you
