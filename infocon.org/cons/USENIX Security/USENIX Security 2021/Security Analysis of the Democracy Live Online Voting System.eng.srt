1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,880
hello everyone and thanks for tuning in

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
this is a security analysis the

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,559
democracy live online voting system i'm

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,160
mike spector and this is joint work with

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
jlx alderman

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,279
so this is is a security analysis of an

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,760
internet voting system used in the 2020

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,840
u.s federal elections

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
and to begin i'd like to start by

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,519
explaining a bit of a tyro back that we

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,199
have to do here

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,520
on one hand as researchers we have to be

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
able to critique the systems that we're

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
using in order to protect

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
voters and improve the democratic

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,559
process

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,559
on the other we have to be careful to

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,399
avoid allowing our work to be taken out

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,680
of context

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
and used to attack the very institutions

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
we're trying to protect

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,559
so here's a bit of a disclaimer

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,239
nothing in this work indicates that the

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,440
2020 presidential election was hacked

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
to the best of our knowledge omni ballot

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,800
the product that we're evaluating here

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,440
from democracy live was thankfully not

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,960
used in pennsylvania georgia or arizona

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
and we stand by the letter we signed

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
along with 50 other election security

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,439
researchers

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,880
stating that there is no compelling

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
evidence of computer fraud in the 2020

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
presidential election outcome

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
you can read more about that here

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
now with that out of the way why would

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,840
we want to do this analysis at

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,680
all so last year i presented a paper on

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,439
another internet voting system called

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
votes that was also used in u.s federal

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
elections and we found that votes

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
had vulnerabilities that would allow a

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,920
number of different kinds of adversaries

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
to alter stop or expose a user's vote

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
and as a result most of the counties

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,479
using votes actually abandoned the

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,000
product

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
this included a number of jurisdictions

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
in oregon and colorado as well as the

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,320
entire state of west virginia

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,040
unfortunately kova 19 caused states to

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
reconsider

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
and a number adopted new voting

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
mechanisms

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
and a few actually adopted yet another

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
internet voting system called democracy

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
lies omni ballot

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,800
now the system actually has seen some

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
adoption already uh in fact it was used

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
by seven state governments and 98

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,040
jurisdictions in 11 states but at a much

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,319
lower level

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
for instance the planned adoption for

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,200
the 2020 presidential primaries included

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
uh used by 22 percent of west virginia's

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,760
population which is uh significantly

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,599
higher than margin of error but as

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
though that's not enough delaware and

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
new jersey actually plan on using it for

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,760
uh the totality of their population

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,599
um so this leads to a very obvious

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,120
question right does democracy live

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
system actually fair any better than

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,239
votes

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
now there's a number of things that

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,440
actually made performing this analysis

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
somewhat difficult

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
and the first is that election systems

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,239
have a number of subtle security

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,800
requirements that are not seen in other

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
systems

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
uh and in fact electronic voting has

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,319
really been a topic of research since

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
the 80s in the academic cryptography and

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,920
system security literature

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,280
and as a result we have a pretty good

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
handle on the kind of definitions in the

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
cryptographic sense

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
for what we want so let's go through

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
those and it'll explain a little bit

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,920
about why the the requirements are

92
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
somewhat subtle

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
so the first two are relatively

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
straightforward uh there's correctness

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
and usability which states that a vote

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,400
is counted as cast cash is intended and

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
accessible to all eligible voters

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,440
the second is privacy which just states

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
that an attacker cannot learn a voter

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
selection okay so so far this is

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,920
straightforward

102
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
but then there's receipt freeness which

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,760
states that a voter cannot prove the way

104
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,280
that they voted after the fact and this

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
prevents uh vote selling actually

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
and there's coercion resistance which

107
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
states that a voter cannot cooperate

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,280
with an attacker to prove the way they

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
voted so they can't be forced into

110
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,120
voting in a way that an attacker wants

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
them to vote

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
finally there's this idea of n10

113
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,239
verifiability

114
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
which has actually been the main focus

115
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
of cryptography research

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
here voters are given some proof that

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
their vote was actually counted in the

118
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
final tally correctly

119
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,879
and this is considered a prerequisite

120
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
for internet voting as it allows us to

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
remove trust in the system's servers and

122
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,720
other infrastructure used to cast the

123
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
ballot

124
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,400
a further complication that we have to

125
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
contend with here is that we have to be

126
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
kind of careful in our analysis

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
democracy lives omni ballot has multiple

128
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
modes that have different threat models

129
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
for example there's ones that simply

130
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,440
just deliver the ballot in which case

131
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
the ballot is physically

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,919
marked printed and mailed back

133
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,440
then they have a remote accessible vote

134
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
by mail system which is sort of like a

135
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
ballot marking device but you're using

136
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
your computer and printing it out at

137
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
home instead of

138
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
going to a polling place so the ballot

139
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
here is marked electronically

140
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
but then physically printed and mailed

141
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
finally they have uh full-on internet

142
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
voting where the ballot is marked

143
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
electronically and sent back through

144
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
democracy live servers

145
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
so with all this in mind we really

146
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
wanted to know first how well does

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
democracy alive achieve those

148
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
correctness goals that we had before the

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
cryptographic goals that we had before

150
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
including correctness privacy receipt

151
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
freeness and coordination resistance

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
second is the system actually intent

153
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,520
verifiable right this is an internet

154
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,199
voting system after all and this is a

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,800
generally seen as a requirement for an

156
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
internet voting system to work

157
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960
second what are the non-ballot

158
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,639
privacy properties of the system right

159
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,759
because

160
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440
a voting system inherently gets a lot of

161
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
information about voters and

162
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
it would be very useful to know exactly

163
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,479
how

164
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,960
how it treats voter data

165
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
and third how well do these other modes

166
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
of democracy life fare and how does one

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
even begin to analyze them

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
now the final challenge we faced was the

169
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
general obnoxiousness of the system and

170
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
the the documentation involved and the

171
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
easiest way to explain this is by a

172
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
walkthrough of how the voter actually

173
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
ends up interacting with the product

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
so this is what you first see when you

175
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
begin to use omniballet

176
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
each instance of omnibot is actually

177
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
skinned to look like it is from the

178
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,759
department running the election not

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,360
democracy live

180
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
in this case this is from the state of

181
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360
delaware

182
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
first the user is asked to enter their

183
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
name and birth date followed by the last

184
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,600
four digits of their social security

185
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,639
number

186
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
now at this point they've already begun

187
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
sort of recording a lot of invasive

188
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
information about the voter and

189
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
naturally one would wonder what their

190
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
privacy policy says it looks like

191
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
there's one right here

192
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
except that this turns out to be

193
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,080
google's privacy policy not democracy

194
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
lives

195
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
and in fact there is no omni ballot

196
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,520
privacy policy

197
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
anyway after the voter has actually

198
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,160
authenticated uh they use they get to

199
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
see this following screen to select

200
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
uh which type of return

201
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,720
system that they would like so for

202
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
instance via fax by email or electronic

203
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,759
return

204
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
but what's really interesting here is

205
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,720
that there's this text that says please

206
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,759
note

207
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,600
and it ends with these ballots are

208
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
scanned for tabulation with other

209
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
absentee ballots no votes are counted

210
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,080
are cast online under any circumstances

211
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
and what's interesting here is that

212
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
literally right below this text there

213
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
are these two boxes that save high email

214
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,080
or electronic return

215
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,039
and

216
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
to put it charitably they have a very

217
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
seem to have a very

218
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,039
uh

219
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,039
odd interpretation of the term caste

220
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
finally uh the user is allowed to vote

221
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
and then confirm their vote

222
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
and uh they they're treated to this nice

223
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
success screen uh uh that has a number

224
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
of interesting features including this

225
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
nice link uh to technical support where

226
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
you can report a bug

227
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
uh so we found a few bugs in our

228
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
analysis and uh we actually like to see

229
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,720
what they what they have to say here um

230
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
and it turns out they do have like a

231
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
policy and let me read it to you

233
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
it says by submitting a report we agree

234
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
not to disclose the bug to any third

235
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
parties without the prior approval of

236
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
democracy live

237
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
well at least it's straightforward

238
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,840
but we can't really agree to this

239
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,879
and we can't really trust their

240
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
documentation because a lot of the

241
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
things we saw earlier were kind of

242
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
misleading

243
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
and we didn't really want to report

244
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
never report our findings so we actually

245
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,120
had to perform this analysis without

246
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
involvement of the company

247
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
and this led to a number of constraints

248
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,479
and a key challenge was that we actually

249
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,520
really couldn't touch their server

250
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
infrastructure for a number of legal and

251
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
ethical concerns

252
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,039
and therefore we had to make a number of

253
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,400
assumptions about how their back end

254
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
worked

255
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
and our solution here was to mainly

256
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
reverse engineer the client

257
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
and then iteratively re-implement the

258
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,599
server the server side to better

259
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,599
understand the protocol and to be

260
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,199
charitable to them we're going to assume

261
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
the best possible case for the backend

262
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
in our analysis and whenever we deviated

263
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,199
from this assumption we explicitly

264
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
discussed why in the paper

265
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
finally what i'm about to present is an

266
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
analysis of the system as of june 2020

267
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,679
and we make no claims about anything

268
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
they've done since

269
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
so what did we find well the system is a

270
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
large relatively complicated web app

271
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,120
that relies on a number of third parties

272
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
to perform its services

273
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,560
the app dynamically fetches and runs

274
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
javascript loaded from amazon

275
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,519
google cloud and cloudflare

276
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,040
making all three companies as well as

277
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
democracy live itself potential points

278
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,839
of compromise for the election system

279
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,279
we also found that the system is not

280
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,120
antenna verifiable and not coercion

281
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
resistant or receipt free

282
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,200
we found that attackers could manipulate

283
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
the ballot design compromise about

284
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,360
secrecy and invisibly change votes uh

285
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
and the only thing that really prevented

286
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,360
the client the server or

287
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
any of these third parties from doing so

288
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,760
uh was the use of physical media so for

289
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
instance blank ballot printing

290
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
the client the server or third parties

291
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,839
could very easily manipulate the ballot

292
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
design but couldn't necessarily

293
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,519
compromise ballot secrecy or invisibly

294
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,800
change votes because of course the

295
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
ballot is printed out and physically

296
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
marked and then mailed back

297
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,519
but of course marked ballot printing

298
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,040
when you do the remote accessible vote

299
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,839
by mail option uh could be manipulated

300
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
and uh the ballot design could be

301
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
manipulated and uh the secrecy of the

302
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,839
ballot was in fact compromised and

303
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,000
finally an on right line ballot return

304
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
there was nothing protecting the user

305
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
much at all

306
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
so how did well did democracy live fare

307
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,200
in in the realm of privacy well the

308
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
system collects the voters name address

309
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
date of birth and a partial social

310
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,399
security number but really interestingly

311
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
it also collects a browser fingerprint

312
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
which is a kind of tracking mechanism

313
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
that's sort of like a super cookie uh

314
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
it's something that you actually can't

315
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,079
delete

316
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,839
uh off your system at all even if you're

317
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
in like private browsing mode

318
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
uh it also uploads the voter's secret

319
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
ballot selections even if the voter

320
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,399
prints and physically mails in the

321
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,560
ballot so in the case where you mark the

322
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,680
ballot uh locally it actually ends up

323
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
serving your voters uh voter selections

324
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
their ballot selections

325
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,399
to democracy live servers

326
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,160
finally the system uses google analytics

327
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,920
and google gets your voter voter id and

328
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
therefore your party affiliation

329
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
and again there's no privacy policy and

330
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,560
no public restriction on any of the use

331
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,279
of any of this data

332
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,360
and to reiterate right this information

333
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,959
is highly valuable for political

334
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,839
purposes or for election interference

335
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,360
as it can be used to target ads or

336
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
disinformation campaigns based on the uh

337
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
voters find grain preferences and

338
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
there's no restriction on use of data

339
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
here which is very worrying

340
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
all right so we found all of this all

341
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
these these uh interesting properties of

342
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
the system uh what do we think about

343
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
this means in the larger picture

344
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
and really what i want to tell you about

345
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
is the fact that there have been five

346
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
uh security analyses of internet voting

347
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
systems used in real world high-stakes

348
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,600
elections and there appears to be an

349
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,720
ongoing pattern that i want to point out

350
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
the first is that they were all deployed

351
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,800
before public analysis was done

352
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,600
uh

353
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
all of them had significant barriers to

354
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,519
analysis and disclosure including the

355
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
need to reverse engineer or

356
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
code obfuscation or ndas and other

357
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
limitations

358
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
all of them had poor misleading

359
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,079
documentation of how the system worked

360
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
except the swiss post system

361
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,360
which was actually instrumental in

362
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
finding the vulnerabilities that they

363
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
found

364
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
and finally there were a number of all

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,160
of them suffered from implementation and

366
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
or design flaws

367
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
and my point is that there's clearly a

368
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
need for regulation requiring public

369
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
security analysis prior to these systems

370
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
being fielded in real elections

371
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,279
and in lieu of this regulation science

372
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,240
has been

373
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,160
stepping up to provide insight to help

374
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
regulators understand these risks and

375
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,079
really must continue to do so until ban

376
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,279
or other regulation is implemented

377
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
so to summarize

378
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
we presented here the first security

379
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
analysis of an internet

380
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,360
voting system in u.s federal elections

381
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
and in fact the first analysis of a

382
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,760
remote accessible vote by mail system

383
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,440
we found a number of security and

384
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
privacy issues that were then reported

385
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
both to the vendor and to

386
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,120
cisa and dhs and the uh affected parties

387
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
um what i'm really proud of though is

388
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
that new jersey and delaware actually

389
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,399
halted use of omnivallet for this

390
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,680
internet voting for the electronic

391
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
return

392
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
however the the system is still used in

393
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
west virginia and denver in november

394
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,639
2020.

395
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,079
so with that thank you so much for

396
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,600
tuning in and i look forward to hearing

397
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,760
your questions

398
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,240
you
