00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
this is our collaboration work with

molly mau

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
the connected vehicle technology has

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,239
been brought out for years in general

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,079
civic technology wirelessly connects

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,399
vehicles and infrastructures together to

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,559
share vehicle status and services in

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
real time it aims at enhancing the

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,440
safety mobility and convenience

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
as shown in this figure signals from the

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
responder vehicle inform oncoming

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,079
vehicles of a crash ahead it wants

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
drivers of lane closings and that they

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,840
should reduce speeds when approaching

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
the incident zoom

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,080
however the integrated communication

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,159
capability vertically increases the

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,320
attack surface of vehicles

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
since cv technology will be closely

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
connected to our daily life

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,479
it's highly desirable to systematically

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
understand design level flaws in the

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
current cv network stack as well as in

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
cv applications

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
and the corresponding security

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
consequences

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
when many target potential design flows

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
in the cv network stack and cv

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
applications because design flows can

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
affect all implementation solving them

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,320
can help us proactively address the

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
security problems before large scale

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
deployments to avoid unnecessary costs

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
among different security properties we

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
identified that availability is a

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,600
missing piece in the cv security

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
analysis

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
cv technology brings us different

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
services to enhance driving safety if

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,200
the services are not available the

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
benefits of cv technology no longer

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,920
exist therefore it's quite important for

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
us to guarantee the availability of cv

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,439
communication

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,360
in this graph the attacker can disable

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
signature verification such that all

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
incoming threats warnings will be

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
discarded and never reached to the

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
driver

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
before starting the security analysis

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
here is a list of limitations of

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
existing works first there are lack of

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
systematic approaches for attack

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
discovery and threat assessments and

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
rely on manual efforts

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
second they pay less attention to the

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800
availability threats

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
third they target on prior generations

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,080
of protocols ignoring the analysis of

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
serious applications

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,200
overall make four major contributions in

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
this work first we performed the first

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
security analysis on cv protocols

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,360
including the latest version of ie1609

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,519
protocol family and two platoon

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,160
management protocols second we show the

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
effectiveness of cv analyzer and find

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
multiple new denial service attacks

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
third to show its practicality we

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,519
implement validates all of them in the

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,920
real world testbed at last we also

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
discussed fundamental reasons and

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,959
proposed mitigation solutions

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
for the security analysis we follow the

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,840
same threat model as recent works we

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
assume that the attacker can fully

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
control a cv device and own valley

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,239
sleeve case therefore the attacker can

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,239
send arbitrary packets to surrounding

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,480
vehicles and passively e-withdraw all

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
packets from others

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
we do not consider any attacks against

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,680
the crypto

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
operations in other words the attacker

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
cannot break existing crypto algorithms

98
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
here is the overview of cv analyzer a

99
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,040
model checking based approach sieve

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,959
analyzer combines the general model

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,280
checker for vulnerability discovery and

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
the probabilistic model checker for

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,440
result assessment there are four steps

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
within our approach model construction

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
model checking to find count examples

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
result assessment to quantify

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
consequences of identified attacks and

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,879
attack validation we will briefly

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
introduce all four steps in the later

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
slides

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
the constructive model includes two

112
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,080
components

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
protocol state machine and the

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,360
environment

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,959
for the state machine we manually

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,440
extract model from specifications for

117
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
saving network particles or from code

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
bases for two platoon management

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,280
particles

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
we consider both packet type and packet

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
data in our model

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
the environment handles different events

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
incoming outgoing packets added deleted

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,960
expired timers the state machine will

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
first retrieve an event from the

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
environment and process it

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
then it may generate new events and

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
deliver them to the environment

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
which is the post-processing step we

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
place the attacker with the environment

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,919
so that

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
the attacker can inject arbitrary

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
packets to the environment and monitors

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
all transmitted packets

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
as we mentioned before we consider

136
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,720
packet data that usually has large data

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
domain

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
which largely increase the total number

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
of states for model checking therefore

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
we propose a state reduction approach to

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,639
eliminate

142
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
to eliminate unnecessary states while

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
still preserving soundness

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,039
our goal is to ensure that the content

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,520
example found in abstracted model is

146
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
still a valid example in the original

147
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,479
model

148
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,639
as indicated in the formula

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
if the identified context sample

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
violates property heads which is a

151
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
weakened property in the abstracted

152
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
model it will also validate the original

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
property and thus is a valid example in

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
the original model

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
our state reduction approach is built

156
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,360
upon two observations

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
first without the attacker not all state

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
transitions will be triggered therefore

159
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,639
we only keep a small set of them

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,199
second different attack inputs trigger

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
the same state transitions

162
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,919
thus we can reduce attack input space as

163
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
long as the attacker can trigger all

164
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,800
unique state transitions

165
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,280
after building the model and applying a

166
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
state reduction approach

167
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
we combine two different types of model

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
checkers for the general model checker

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,319
we choose tlc due to its

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
due to its expressiveness of

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,319
constructing the model we formulate the

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
availability property as a liveness

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
property here is a high level property

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,960
we used we want to ensure that the

175
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
application layer can always consume

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
valid incoming packets we further refine

177
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
this property for different protocols

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
by analyzing the generated code example

179
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,800
we can formulate the attack procedure

180
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
and analyze the fundamental reasons for

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
identified attacks which is helpful for

182
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,800
mitigation design

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,479
then we use a probabilistic model

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,360
checker prism for risk assessment

185
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
unlike the general model checker pmc

186
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
assigns probabilities for each state

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
transition

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
in our paper we assign uniform

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
probabilities to concurrent states

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
transitions

191
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
with probability information pmc can

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
help us generate quantitative results

193
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,759
like attack success rates and verified

194
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,800
time-related properties we only use pmc

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
to quantify the severity of

196
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
non-deterministic attacks which are

197
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,560
defined as attacks that may not always

198
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
succeed per attempt

199
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
this is a summary of our findings from

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
the general model checker we

201
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
successfully identified four new denial

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,960
service vulnerabilities in cv network

203
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
protocols and 15 attacks in platoon

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,880
management protocols

205
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
we also showed in our paper that some of

206
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
them can eliminate the benefits of cv

207
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
technology and further resulting traffic

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
collision

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
due to the time limit we will only

210
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
introduce one attack and three here this

211
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
is the pipeline of ppcd which stands for

212
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000
peer-to-peer certificate distribution is

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
a unique feature specified in cv

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
security services with the goal of

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
helping a cv device to learn unknown

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,599
certificates

217
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,080
in cv network all packets are required

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
to be signed and transmitted with a

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,199
digital signature which form the secured

220
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
protocol data units spdus

221
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
if the signing certificating the

222
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
received svdu is unknown to the cv

223
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
device it will record the unknown

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
certificate and send a learning request

225
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,080
to invoke pdpcd procedure by design once

226
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
a peer device then knows the

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,120
requested certificate observer request a

228
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,039
learning response will send to the

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
network then the cv device can store the

230
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
received certificates for future

231
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
verification

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
the attack goal of entry is to prevent

233
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
victim device from sending learning

234
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
requests

235
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
according to the protocol specification

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
if a cva device observes a learning

237
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,120
request to the same unknown certificate

238
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
it will discard its own request and wait

239
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,080
for responses from others

240
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
if the attacker sends a learning request

241
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,800
that the victim device will not send its

242
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
own however due to the broadcast nature

243
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
the learning request from the attacker

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,800
can still be received of a peer device

245
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
to achieve the attack goal the attacker

246
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
further explores unicast of cv

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,279
communication and only transmits the

248
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
learning request to the intended victim

249
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
in this case the

250
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
attacker can further block all future

251
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
steps in this ppcd pipeline the cv

252
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
device will not be able to learn unknown

253
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
certificates

254
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,000
therefore it cannot consume packets from

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
peer devices

256
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,320
we leverage pmc to quantify the severity

257
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,800
of non-deterministic attacks from n1 to

258
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
n4 we observe that ppcd attacks can

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
succeed only if managed packets are

260
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
delivered to the victim vehicle exactly

261
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
within the attack time window however

262
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,360
the attacker cannot precisely infer the

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
start and end of the time window then we

264
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,160
use pmc to quantify the severity based

265
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,720
on success rate and time delay as shown

266
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,880
in this table all four attacks can

267
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,160
achieve around 99 success rate for the

268
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
time delay 218 milliseconds is the one

269
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
time delay introduced by pvpc itself at

270
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
the worst case they can even double the

271
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
time delay

272
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
to show the practicality of identified

273
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
attacks we validate all of them in the

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
real world test method which is consists

275
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
of three obu's two of them are victim cv

276
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
device and one is the attack device

277
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,839
during the attack validation

278
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
we also find some implementation details

279
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
that makes our attacks easier for

280
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
example we found that n1 and n2 can

281
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
indefinitely block the cv communication

282
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,519
instead of waiting a specific time

283
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,480
period

284
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
we also demonstrate the attack impacts

285
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
of identified attacks for example ppcd

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
attacks can eliminate the benefits of cv

287
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
safety applications

288
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
leading to rare and decletion the

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
audience can refer to our paper for more

290
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
details

291
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
to defend against identified attacks we

292
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
have detailed discussion of fundamental

293
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
reasons in the paper and further

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
proposed mitigation solutions as listed

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
in this table

296
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
ppcd attacks from m1 to m4 are many due

297
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
to the optional verification of learning

298
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,399
responses truncated hash and the unicast

299
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,880
feature defined in cv network particles

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,680
solutions 1 to 3 together can defeat n1

301
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
to m4 for pmp attacks there are many

302
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
caused by the missing aero recovery

303
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,880
mechanisms which should not be ignored

304
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
by future civil applications

305
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,399
at last to conclude this presentation we

306
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
performed the first rigorous security

307
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
analysis to find denial service attacks

308
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
in civil network protocols and

309
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
applications

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
we discovered four new attacks in ppcd

311
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,959
and the 14 new pmp

312
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,760
attacks eliminating the benefits of cv

313
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,519
technology we demonstrate the

314
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
practicality of identified

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
vulnerabilities as well we discuss the

316
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
fundamental reasons and proposed

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
mitigation solutions

318
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
thanks everyone i'm open to any

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
questions
