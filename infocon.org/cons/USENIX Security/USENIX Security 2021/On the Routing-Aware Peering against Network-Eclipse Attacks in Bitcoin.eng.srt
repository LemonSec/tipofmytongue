00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,120
hello everyone my name is a final year

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
psd student from the national university

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,639
of singapore

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,039
i am going to present our papers on the

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,600
routing aware appearance against network

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
eclipse attacks in bitcoin

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,640
cds i work with access cenoi also from

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
the national university of singapore and

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
my advisors misukan we now at kais

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,040
when it comes to securities of

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
blockchain networks one of the most

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
dangerous threats is partitioning

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
attacks

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
in partitioning attacks the adversaries

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,879
isolate targeted victims from the rest

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,800
of the peer-to-peer networks

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
once the victim be isolated the

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,239
adversary can arbitrarily inject drop or

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,160
delay the communication between the

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
victim and the peer-to-peer networks and

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,280
launch several full-on attacks against

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,680
the victim such as double spending

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,719
attacks or censoring transaction

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,280
see what happened in 2020 in an

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
increased attacks against monero a

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,920
popular cryptocurrencies that dropped

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
the transition of several users

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
there are a few party sending attacks

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,159
introduced in the last few years and

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
most of them have been already mitigated

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
effectively

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,320
they include a botnet-based eclipse

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
attacks introduced at using security 15

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
which doesn't work anymore because to

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
that all exploited vulnerabilities have

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,759
been fixed

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,000
another existing work is a raw heisei

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
king attacks appear at iqex and p70

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,400
however

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
the attack is immediately detectable and

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
attributable

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,399
more recently we presented the ability

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
to argue smp 20.

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
the airbus attacks is stealthier than

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
existing actors and harder to prevent

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,119
in this talk we discuss the practical

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,200
culture measures to these airbus attacks

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
so elvis electronics is network equipped

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
attacks in bitcoin let me briefly

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
explain how it works

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,400
first you need to know that bitcoin

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
loads you an internal database to store

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
ip address of another node

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
and select its peers

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,239
second the errors attacker your

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
monitor's autonomous systems are a yes

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,000
in this segment the adversary spooked

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
the peer identities using the eyepiece

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,560
behind herself in the victim views

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,519
this

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,200
grids are shown at the top of the

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,840
figures on the left hand side are called

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
sado eyepiece

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
then the adversary slowly inserts shadow

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,080
ips

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,480
into victim database and waits for the

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,080
victim to select those subtle ips

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
when this happened

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
the rectangles become the man in the

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,760
middles of all peer connections of the

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,239
victim and the victim ea creeps

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
countering elbow syntax is challenging

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
because the attack curve with the

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
network capabilities only exploit the

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,319
permissible natures of bitcoin p2ps to

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,599
find meanings of style ips to eventually

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
eclipse the victim

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
compared to about 10 000 nodes in the

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
current bitcoin network millions of

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,680
identities in huge numbers

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
there already exists some approach for

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
countering the airbus attacks such as

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
some workaround like vpn

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
tall or wireless thing some reputable

85
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,959
node

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,920
however

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
such live solutions require

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
some external service in the current

89
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
bitcoin signal

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
also

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
the bitcoin communities has quickly

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
implemented some protocol tricks to make

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
the adversaries spend more

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,120
execution time such as increasing the

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
number of outbound connections from 8 to

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,519
10

97
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
or use ip2as mapping in the peer

98
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,319
database

99
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,080
however they are not complete solution

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,799
indeed we evaluate the effectiveness of

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
a variable protocol fixed and here are

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,639
the results

103
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,440
so why asus shows the exact success rate

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,639
of the reverse attacks and lower values

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
so method defense

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
for the accurate definition of the

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
attack success rate phrase referred to

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
our papers

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
here we evaluate some text on how psips

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,120
are managed in the database

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
and some tips that improve the peer

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
selection procedures

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
as we can see from the chart all

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
available protocon takes so only

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
marginal effectiveness or grains of

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,039
airbus attacks

117
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
knowing the limitation of existing power

118
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
measures we turn our attention to a

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
known solution from literature that has

120
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
been used to handle similar attacks

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
launched by network adversary

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
which is round away peering

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
while away purine or rug is frequently

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
used

125
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
to avoid on part neck adversary

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
especially in tall systems such as glass

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,479
store

128
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,680
or cartoraptor and so on

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,400
under rug pier are say based on the

130
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,120
routing parts to the peers let's see how

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
it works in bitcoin with the previous

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
example

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
here the victim used rough before

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,960
establishing the peering connections

135
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
rough calculate the routing parts from

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,440
the client to the peers and have to

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
detect attackers appearing on all the

138
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
part

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
so the errors attacker

140
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
can be easily detected as you can see

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
from this example

142
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,479
are we done

143
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,400
can wrap prevent everybody's attacks if

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
we like that

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,319
unexpectedly the answer is no

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,039
unfortunately we found a subtle problem

147
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,840
with this approach

148
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
as always the default in the details in

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
particular we found some non-identities

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
of rough implementation

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
assuming a victim node is getting the

152
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
routing part to the psi piece on the

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,639
right hand side

154
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,520
here

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,880
rob can get the roush by measuring

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,919
the

157
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
traffic's route using some probing tools

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
such as trace bar

159
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,720
however because the over sector curve e

160
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,199
on the part the reticle can easily

161
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,160
manipulate the reason or even drop the

162
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
probing

163
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,319
hence the round measurement cannot be

164
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
used in practice

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
alternatively the victim can estimate

166
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,160
the forwarding files occurring the route

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
from the local routing tables

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
however the estimation can be inaccurate

169
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,639
and mixed onboard attacker

170
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,520
and this little some cellular ip can be

171
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,319
misidentified

172
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,440
was

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
those miss identifies ip can be

174
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,759
exploited by airbus attacker we now

175
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
aware of this drop defense

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
in particular smarter airbus attackers

177
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,199
can use only misidentified cell ips to

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
undermine block

179
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
the attacker first select the

180
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
misidentified survivor piece by er

181
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
emulating

182
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
the best wrap implementation

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
then the average attacker inserts only

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,560
the misidentified solo ips to the victim

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
so canva prevents this smarter airbus

186
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
attacks

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,479
to answer this we perform a large-scale

188
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
experiment of about 6000 scenarios in

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
which the attackers are top one of those

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,120
ais and victims run at 59 different

191
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
locations such as

192
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
popular cloud networks

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
and here is a result

194
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
we find that the airbus attacks against

195
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,960
the baseline clan

196
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,319
are successful

197
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,120
in

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
55 of the cases

199
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,319
when the client implement rough the

200
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,840
attack success rate decreased but to 33

201
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,599
percent only

202
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
the reason so that in contrary to our

203
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
expectation rap alone is insufficient to

204
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,878
prevent the urban sectors

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,479
so

206
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
why the wrap network in bitcoin

207
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,400
first

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
round estimation is known to be

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,719
imperfect and even with the state of zs

210
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
implementation

211
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
here either evolving of some misread of

212
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,000
four state of the brow estimation

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
approach

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
is so that

215
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
there are at least six percent of the

216
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
silo ips are misidentified

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
and here

218
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
is the literature of the numbers of cyto

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
eyepiece and miss

220
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
identify solo ips

221
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,880
we can see that the number of

222
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
misidentified solo ips is significantly

223
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,959
smaller

224
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
than the number of solo ips however

225
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,959
the actual then can find tens of

226
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,440
thousands of spooked pi entities using

227
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
the misidentified cellular ipx

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
this explains the successful error

229
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
syntax that we saw in the previous slide

230
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
knowing that none of the defense is

231
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
sufficient alone we attempt to make the

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
best available solution

233
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
for the second comparison we saw again

234
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
the success rate of the attacks against

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,279
the baseline clan is 55 percent first we

236
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,240
find that wrap must be customized

237
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,200
accordingly to its bitcoin topological

238
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
location

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
for example we need different wrap

240
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
customization for two different notes in

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
which one node in a highly well

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,480
connected network while the other node

243
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,120
in a single hole network

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
please see our paper for more detail on

245
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,959
this

246
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,240
we find that

247
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
the location customized profiles can

248
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,440
reduce attack success rate to nine

249
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
percent

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
second we need to evaluate all

251
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
combinations of protocol tricks to find

252
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
out the most effective one because

253
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
adding more tweaks doesn't guarantee a

254
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
better defense

255
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
the most effective twist combination

256
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,880
that we can find reduce the attack

257
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
success rate to 21

258
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
and lastly we find that when combining

259
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
rough and twigs together we have the

260
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,079
most effective defense so far this has

261
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,920
made the attack success rate dropped to

262
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,199
only 3 percent

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
in conclusion contrary to our

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
expectation

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
uh rotting over peering or rub alone

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
insufficient to prevent the airbus

267
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
attacks

268
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
uh because there are no perfect euro

269
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
free route estimation for rough in

270
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
practice and smarter airbus attackers

271
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,560
can exploit rough grid slips to

272
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,480
undermine

273
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,200
however we saw that most bitcoin can be

274
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,519
protected from the airbus attacks when

275
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,800
wrap is customized for its bitcoin node

276
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,680
and

277
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
when is it combined with a variable

278
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
protocol text

279
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,160
for more updates on the deployments of

280
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,120
rap and other protocol takes phase visit

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
our website with a following link

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
and for that i conclude my presentation

283
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
