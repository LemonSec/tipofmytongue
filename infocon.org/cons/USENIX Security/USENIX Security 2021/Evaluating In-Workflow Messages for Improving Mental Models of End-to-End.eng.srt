1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
hello everyone welcome to this

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
presentation on evaluating in workflow

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,000
messages for improving mental models of

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,119
end-to-end encryption uh i'm ahmed uh i

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,439
did this work with my collaborators wei

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,080
and shuri uh and my advisor michelle we

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
were all at university of maryland when

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,599
we did this work but we is at google now

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,199
all right now we're going to talk a lot

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,280
about end-to-end encryption and end

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,399
users

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
and the relationship between them uh

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
and this work builds upon about two

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
decades worth of research of adoption of

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
uh internal encryption by general users

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
uh now these are everyday users they're

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
not any specific population like i don't

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
know refugees maybe lawyers anyone that

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
might need encryption more

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,399
now

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,160
initially the problem with internet

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
encryption adoption or encryption

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
adoption in general was ui design and

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,559
that got better over time later on

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
researchers found that key management

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,000
was a big issue private keys and public

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
keys well we've since moved on to

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,520
centralized key distribution systems

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,799
now

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
and then after that uh social norms was

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
an issue

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,799
and large-scale deployment of encrypted

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
messaging apps such as whatsapp and

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
imessage has

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
largely fixed that problem too but at

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,400
least one problem still remains and that

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
is mental models

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
recent research has identified that a

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,320
lot of people have uh perhaps

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,159
misaligned mental models with the real

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,479
threats out the real threat model out

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,280
there

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
some people think that encryption can be

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,159
trivially broken while others think that

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,079
it protects from everything both of

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,039
these are not true

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,360
some also think that

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,079
other communication services uh compared

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
to internet encryption are better such

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,439
as such as sms or even uh ones that are

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,920
not encrypted at all

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
now this all means that people

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
even though they've already adopted the

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
tools such as whatsapp and imessage

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
they can't confidently proactively and

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,360
correctly use it use these products they

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,599
don't know what they do

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,239
okay so our goal here is to fix this

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
problem a little bit and we want to

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
improve mental models naturally so we

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
want to change basic understandings of

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
the threats

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
just enough to make judgments about

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
these products about how to communicate

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,840
without turning people into crypto

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
experts having them sit through long

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
lectures

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
and our solution to this problem is to

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
place educational messages about

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,920
end-to-end encryption uh in a messaging

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
app uh where people can see them where

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
when they're already texting people

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
now uh in order to get to this goal of

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
embedding messaging

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
educational messages into an app we

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
follow a multi-stage effort the first

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
effort the first stage was published

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,800
somewhere else in europe 2nd 2020

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
and i'll cover that really quickly in a

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,519
second the second stage uh though so for

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,319
so

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,959
the first stage identified uh topics

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
that user were mo users were most

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
interested in and easily understood the

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
second stage uh is an isolated uh test

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
of messages that we create based on the

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
findings of

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,519
study one and then the final study is a

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
more environmentally valid city where we

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
actually embed successful messages into

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,920
a messaging app and test them out

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
now

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
just to recap study one uh we find in

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
that study uh that uh users care a lot

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,959
about confidentiality uh they care a lot

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
about the risks of antoine encryption uh

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,480
this uh this included uh comparing it to

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,879
an encryption encrypted uh communication

99
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
methods to uh

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
communication uh methods that are that

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
are not antoine encrypted uh but also

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
the weaknesses of menton encryption

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
itself so that's metadata risks or maybe

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
endpoint risks

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
such as malware on your phone or someone

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
stealing your phone

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
we also found that some pieces are not

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
worth mentioning because they were hard

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
to understand or hard to convey such as

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,879
integrity and authenticity just hard to

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
understand concepts and the technical

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,040
details of entrepreneur encryption

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
now taking these

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
takeaways these results we feed them

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
into study two and we wanna test actual

116
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
text we want we want to test messages

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,199
to try to shift user mental models

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
and we want to do this in isolation for

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,040
now to see if they work at all

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
and what we do is we

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
craft different lengths of messages

122
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
short medium along appropriate for

123
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,720
various uis in the app

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
and we want to see how effective what

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
versions of these messages are and for

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
what can we use them for

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
it's important to note here

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
that one of our goals is to not oversell

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
security until encryption is great but

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
it does has have its weaknesses

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
all right let's look at the setup well

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,039
it was a crowdsourced study we recruited

133
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
people from prolific

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
and we designed a bunch of messages to

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,800
show these people and compared to each

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
other uh all in the context of a

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,720
hypothetical and to an encrypted

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,880
messaging app called text lite we do

139
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,280
this to remove brand bias

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,639
we show one message per participant and

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
uh let's get into those messages

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
starting off with the short messages

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
the first one talked about how nobody

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
but you and the recipient can see the

145
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
content of the messages you send and

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
receive the second one talks about

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
metadata risks such as you know your isp

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,080
finding out who you're talking to uh

149
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,639
endpoint risks so that's again losing

150
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
your phone or maybe malware being

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
installed on your phone uh a key lock

152
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
metaphor to get into

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
some of the

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
the background the

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
um background of how end-to-end

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,639
encryption works but not actually

157
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,560
getting into any technical details and

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,039
finally comparing into an encryption to

159
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,840
uh tools that are not antoine

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,759
we have medium length messages which are

161
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
just various combinations of the short

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
messages a long message which covers all

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
the short talking points in more detail

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
with extra emphasis and a control

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
message that has nothing to do with

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,479
security or privacy

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
now uh this was what the users actually

168
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
saw they took a survey uh about

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
adversaries and their capabilities over

170
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,080
text light um they saw a message that

171
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,400
we've crafted here's a here's an example

172
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
messages and text light are entered and

173
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
encrypted before a message ever leaves

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
your device it's secured with the lock

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
and only you and your recipients have

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
the keys to open the message and read it

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
so this is the key lock metaphor uh it

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,120
gets into a little bit of the details

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
but not really

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,240
and then they take the same survey again

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
again this is attribute series and their

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
capabilities or text site

183
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
and our metric here of how successful

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
these messages are is the difference

185
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,880
between the two questionnaires

186
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
especially compared to the control group

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,599
now before i get into results i want to

188
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,160
talk about this plotting scheme that i

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,680
use quite often throughout the study

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,120
each dot represents a person's change in

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
the the surveys that i was talking about

192
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
so this person highlighted here didn't

193
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
change their opinions at all

194
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
the median is that red dot and the arrow

195
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,919
points at the direction which i or or we

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
wanted the users to change their mental

197
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
model models towards so in this case we

198
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,960
wanted it to go negative now this is the

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,639
control group that's why they just pull

200
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,639
in the middle at zero where they don't

201
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
change their minds

202
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
all right so the the big takeaway is

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
that the messages work the long message

204
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,759
which was our best effort at explaining

205
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
uh what end-to-end encryption is

206
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,400
highlighted in the red box here uh

207
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
shifted towards the negative which is

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
the right direction here which is the

209
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,759
direction we wanted it to go here uh so

210
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
again long message our best effort it

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
worked

212
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
short messages are a bit more

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
complicated but generally they they also

214
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,800
work especially when the message is

215
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
topical so the one highlighted in blue

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,080
here uh is the metadata one it shifts

217
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
positive which is the direction we

218
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,919
wanted it to shift

219
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,479
however we also saw that there is some

220
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
additional risk of overselling so when

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,039
the message was more broad

222
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
for instance the key lock metaphor

223
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,800
people thought that it also purchased it

224
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
protected against metadata which is not

225
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
what we wanted this wasn't statistically

226
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
significant but it's important to keep

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,320
in mind for later

228
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,839
all right what are our takeaways from

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
study2 well it's that the the messages

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
work especially in a controlled

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,599
environment

232
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,599
and short messages work surprisingly

233
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,200
well especially when they're tropical

234
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
there is a chance of overselling

235
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
but we think showing the messages one by

236
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
one these short messages one by one we

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,959
can form a complete mental model

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
all right let's move on to the last

239
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
study we take the what we find from

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,480
study two and feed it into study three

241
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
and we wanna see how well these messages

242
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
that we find successful in a controlled

243
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
environment work in the real world

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
uh especially integrated into an app we

245
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,720
also measure to find out why it works or

246
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,600
why it doesn't work

247
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
now uh the way we do this is we

248
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
incorporate the successful messages into

249
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,680
an app you can see a screenshot of the

250
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,000
message i read before embedded in that

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
blue box up top we rebrand signal to

252
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
text flight just for experimental

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
purposes that's how we implement it

254
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
we show short messages mainly but when

255
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
you click on it you get a long message

256
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
we also created a controlled version of

257
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
text light to be able to compare the

258
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
experimental version to if you were a

259
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
participant this is what you would see

260
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
you take a survey this is the survey

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,519
from before

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,920
you remotely install the app you daily

263
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
chat with a person for about 20 days in

264
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
short texting sessions you take the exit

265
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
survey and again the metric is the

266
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
difference between the exit survey and

267
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
the survey you took when you were first

268
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
installing it and we also do an optional

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
interview moving on to results uh

270
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,160
unfortunately there was no improvement

271
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
in mental models between the control and

272
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
experimental groups uh and we saw that

273
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,079
some people before they even took the

274
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,839
study already knew about some of the

275
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,600
topics this wasn't true for the majority

276
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
of cases but for some questions it was

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
relevant

278
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
in one question unfortunately we did

279
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,920
oversell end-to-end encryption like we

280
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,399
saw in the survey study interviews

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
interviews tell us more about this

282
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
though

283
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,079
now looking at the interviews more than

284
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,920
half of our participants were able to

285
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
generalize the concept

286
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,640
so here's an example this person said

287
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
intuit encryption protects from probably

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
anyone who would interrupt or interfere

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,240
in between the messaging in between

290
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,600
where you sent it and someone else

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
received it

292
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
we saw that a majority of our

293
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
participants knew that unlocked phone

294
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
adversary was powerful

295
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,360
and about half the participants got at

296
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,959
least something wrong so this person

297
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
said it protects from people hacking

298
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,399
into your phone from either reading the

299
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,160
messages or altering the contents of the

300
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
message which is not true unfortunately

301
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,079
we also see that uh almost a majority of

302
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,680
participants just didn't read the

303
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
messages or didn't care about them

304
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
indicating habituation or maybe that

305
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,040
they weren't obvious enough this person

306
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
said i obviously didn't pay a lot of

307
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
attention to it

308
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,680
to sum up

309
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
metal models of secure communication are

310
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,519
not functional enough we see if small

311
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,279
nudges and user-centered design can

312
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
improve things an initial qualitative

313
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
study identifies topics that we can

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
convey to users with messages

315
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,959
a controlled environment allows us to

316
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,560
test these messages and see which ones

317
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
are successful and we test them out in a

318
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,959
real world setting

319
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
we see that in a controlled environment

320
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
some of them work pretty well but

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
integration into apps might need to be

322
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
made more obvious uh so that users can

323
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,200
see them even if this means sacrificing

324
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
usability a little bit

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
with that i'd like to thank our sponsors

326
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
uh darpa and united states air force and

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,560
i'd like to like to thank our

328
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
participants for making this research

329
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,760
possible and i'm happy to take questions

330
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
you
