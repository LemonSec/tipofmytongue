1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,160
welcome everyone and thank you for

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
attending this presentation

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,759
my name is jorgen van de larsgrott and

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
for the coming 12 minutes i will talk

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,680
about the security practices offenders

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
on an online anonymous market

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
in this presentation i will explain how

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
we were able to measure the prevalence

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,039
of certain security practices and how we

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,039
contrasted these practices between

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
different types of vendors

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,558
but first i will give a brief

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,040
introduction on online anonymous markets

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
cyber crime is thriving and online

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,960
anonymous markets or darknet markets

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
play an important role in the cyber

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
criminal ecosystem

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,239
these markets are platforms that

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,120
facilitate the pseudonymous trade of

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
illicit physical goods and digital items

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
the physical goods that are transacted

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
are mostly drugs such as cocaine

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,800
cannabis meth and mdma

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
on most markets drugs are the most

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
traded items

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,040
next to physical items a wide variety of

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
digital items is transacted on these

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,920
markets

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
examples are credit card details hacked

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
paypal accounts money monitoring

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
services accounts of streaming services

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,479
such as netflix and spotify

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
fake identities and email addresses

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
and other kinds of personally

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
identifiable information

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
so that's a lot of different things

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
on these markets there are two types of

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
users buyers and sellers

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
our research mainly focuses on the

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
latter part

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
in the underground community the term

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,000
vendor is used for the selling party

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
vendors that are active on these markets

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
deploy security mechanisms to frustrate

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,399
law enforcement investigation

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
investigators in their attribution

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
efforts

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
actionable information on these opsec

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,759
techniques are frequently shared in the

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600
underground community

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
so given this observation

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
and giving the increasing amount of

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,878
scrutiny by law enforcement

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,038
we should expect that poor security

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
practices are rarely present among users

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,720
that are active on these markets

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,520
however cyber criminals in general do

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
not always achieve maximum security

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
this is because of the inevitable

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
trade-off between security and

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
efficiency of operations

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
perfect security is not economically

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
economically viable

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
just as in the legitimate world security

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
in the illegitimate world comes at a

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
cost

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
and this leads us to wonder how

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
prevalent poor security practices

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,879
among online

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
online anonymous market vendors actually

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
are

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
to find out we captured the security

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
practices on a single market the hansa

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,518
market

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,720
hanza became active in 2015 and was shut

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
down by law enforcement in july 2017.

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
about 400 000 accounts were registered

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
of which 1750 are vendors

79
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
we estimate the revenue of the market to

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
be 33 million us dollars

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
by the end of june 2017 the high-tech

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
crime unit of the dutch police

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,440
infiltrated hansa market

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
they were able they were able to migrate

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
the honda market web servers and even

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
operated the market for a while

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
after they shut down the market dutch

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,959
law enforcement shared the back end with

89
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,360
other law enforcement agencies and

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
allowed us restricted on-premise access

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
access to the data so we could perform

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
in-depth analyses

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
the back-end consists of more than 100

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
data tables that give us insight into

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
the complete administration of the

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
market

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
additionally we leverage the have a binp

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,159
database which is a famous database of

99
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,519
leaked passwords

100
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
it consists of more than

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,319
10 billion leaks passwords of which 600

102
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,879
million are unique

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
next to that we use an offline copy of

104
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,799
the now defunct darknet market search

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,439
engine grants

106
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,639
and lastly

107
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
we we use each analysis blockchain

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
analysis service that can provide

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
context to bitcoin transactions and

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
bitcoin addresses

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
it does so using certain clustering

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
heuristics in this way chanalysis is

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
able to estimate

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
which bitcoin addresses belong to for

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
example bitcoin exchanges

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
okay so far i told you about the market

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
we investigate and the data sources we

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
use in our research

119
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
this brings me to our approach

120
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,919
we use a two-step approach

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,720
first we group similar vendors together

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,120
then we measure the security practices

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,520
of this group's offenders

124
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
so first about grouping similar vendors

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
together

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
we cluster vendors together that are

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
similar regarding the following

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
characteristics

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,720
experience measured as the number of

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
days a vendor is active on the market

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,039
a business success in which i

132
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
differentiate between physical items and

133
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,919
digital items sold

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,840
and whether they are active on other

135
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,199
markets

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,639
the latter could be quite easily

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
observed on the hanzo market because

138
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
hans are allowed to import

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
vendors hansa allowed vendors to import

140
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
their reputation or ratings from other

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
markets

142
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
so from a vendor with an imported

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
reputation we could be sure that he or

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
she

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
is also active on other markets

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
please note that when we are clustering

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,160
vendors into vendor types we do not

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
consider any security characteristics

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
for the clustering we use the clustering

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
algorithm called latent profile analysis

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
this algorithm works like a cos

152
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
optimization function and it finds the

153
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,199
best solution for making groups of

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
vendors in which the groups are very

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
different from each other while within

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
the groups the vendors are very similar

157
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,160
to each other

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,039
secondly we capture certain practice

159
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,240
security practices in our data and we

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,440
compare the prevalence of poor practices

161
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
across vendor times

162
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
i'll come back to the measurement

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
methodology regarding the security

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,679
practices listed here later

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
the latent profile analysis resulted in

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
five vendor types

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
by closely inspecting their most

168
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
different different differentiating

169
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
characteristics i named the vendor types

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,080
as follows

171
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
novices

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,160
who do not have that many physical sales

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
experience and hardly digital sales

174
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,680
then we have the drug dealers this is a

175
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
group offenders that has more physical

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
items sold but still barely any digital

177
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
items sold they're active on a longer

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
period of time than the novices

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
then we have the drug lords this is a

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,319
group of vendors that has used huge

181
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
amounts of

182
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
physical items sold

183
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,960
then there are two clusters of vendors

184
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
that specialize in selling digital items

185
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
these are the digital fraudsters and

186
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
cybercrime elites

187
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,759
we take the following six practices that

188
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,680
impact the security offenders into

189
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
account

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
using the password strength estimation

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
to zxcbn

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
we estimate that more than half of the

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
vendor population has a password that is

194
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,680
considered very unguessable

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
that is it takes more than 10 to the

196
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,560
10th so that is 10 billion guesses to

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
crack the password

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,520
we measure password uniqueness by

199
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
matching the j1 hashes of the vendor's

200
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
passwords with the shayha shay1 hashes

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
of the

202
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
have i been pawns database

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
he find that 70 of the vendors uses a

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
non-unique password

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
this is way more than we initially

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,879
inspected expected

207
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,960
using a non-unique password is a huge

208
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
risk to defender security firstly

209
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
because the password can be guessed in a

210
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
matter of minutes

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
and secondly because if this vendor uses

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
this password on

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,879
both

214
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,440
a breached clearnet website

215
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
and on the hanzo market then this

216
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,599
password

217
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
may lead to an email address or username

218
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,440
of the vendor so this password can then

219
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
be used to de-anonymize the vendor

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
in the hansa back-end we could see which

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
vendors made use of two-factor

222
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,240
authentication enabled logins

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
it's good to add that 2fa on online and

224
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
known as markets works via pgp and not

225
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,240
through sms tags

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
we found that only 60

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,399
of the vendors use this extra layer of

228
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,959
security

229
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
moving on to the analysis of the public

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
pgp keys we found in the hansa back end

231
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
we extracted the key strength of the

232
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,600
public pgp key

233
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
and we found that well barely any weak

234
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
keys so that's a 1024 bits or less were

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,279
observed

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,839
for defenders

237
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,760
even by

238
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,080
2015 standards these key lengths are

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,839
considered not to be sufficient

240
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,320
um and we also found that well almost

241
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,120
every vendor had a pgp key listed

242
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
another security behavior we looked at

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
was whether vendors used different pgp

244
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
keys on different markets

245
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
law enforcement investigators

246
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
can use pgp keys to link different

247
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
usernames that belong to the same

248
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,839
real-world entity

249
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,440
on different markets

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,320
and when these dots can be connected

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
by law enforcement and this forms a

252
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
potential security risk

253
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
lastly we analyzed the bitcoin addresses

254
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
of fenders using niche analysis service

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
we found that 14 of the 190

256
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
000 bitcoin addresses in our data

257
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
could be attributed to known online

258
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
financial service providers

259
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
let's zoom in a bit on this latest

260
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,640
statistic

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
what we see here

262
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,079
is to what type of wallets vendors

263
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
transact to

264
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
on the y-axis you see the number of

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
transactions per month

266
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,360
and you can also see some gaps in this

267
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,160
in this plot and that's because there's

268
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
unfortunately some missing data

269
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
having a direct link

270
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,519
to a bitcoin exchange exchange forms a

271
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
huge security risk

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
bitcoin exchanges log information on

273
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,240
their users and this information can be

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,959
subpoenaed by law enforcement agencies

275
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
this information may entail ip addresses

276
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,120
email addresses but also full names and

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,079
residential addresses so to be honest we

278
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,640
did not expect any direct links to

279
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
exchanges

280
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
however as shown here

281
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,480
quite consistently criminal earnings are

282
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,839
directly transacted to

283
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,600
exchanges about ten percent of the

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
vendors on hansa market

285
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,519
can be linked to essential central

286
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
bitcoin exchange at least once

287
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,519
now that i've explained

288
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,360
how we measured the security practices

289
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,320
in our data and after highlighting some

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
statistics for the whole vendor

291
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,320
population we will compare security

292
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,079
practices across vendor types

293
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
first the password strength here we see

294
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
that the digital fraudsters use the

295
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
simplest passwords and that on average

296
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
drug dealers and drug lords use the

297
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,639
strongest passwords

298
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
we summarize the rest of the practices

299
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
in this table

300
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
if you look at password uniqueness so

301
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
whether we could match a password in the

302
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
have a bin phone database you see that

303
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
again digital fraudsters behave

304
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,760
non-securely the most often only three

305
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,399
quarters have a unique password

306
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,959
and again drug lords behave the most

307
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,279
securely

308
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,360
we see the same pattern for two effect

309
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,000
two factor authentication usage

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
less than half of the digital fraudsters

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,040
use dfa and almost all drug lords use

312
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
doofy

313
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
moving on to the analysis of the pgp

314
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
keys

315
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,399
since we found hardly any wii keys our

316
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
keys are either secure that's 2048 bits

317
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,519
or extremely secure which is more than

318
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,040
2048 bits

319
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,000
in practice till the end of 2030 there

320
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
is no significant security benefit of

321
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,959
using an extremely secure key over a

322
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,800
normal cue key

323
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
it was therefore expected that we would

324
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,240
not see

325
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
any significant differences between

326
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
vendor times

327
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,880
however when we measure the preference

328
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,279
for the extremely secure keys

329
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
we see the same trend as in the other

330
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,639
security practices we analyzed so far

331
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,720
so the drug lords prefer the extremely

332
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
secure keys the most often while the

333
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
digitally focused clusters behave less

334
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
securely

335
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,959
regarding the pgp key reuse we found any

336
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,800
we found barely any differences across

337
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,120
vendor times

338
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
then the last security practice we

339
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
analyzed had quite a surprising outcome

340
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
regarding the linkability to bitcoin

341
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
exchanges we see relatively many drug

342
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,120
lords and cyber crime elites that could

343
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
be linked to

344
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
bitcoin exchanges

345
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
about a fifth of the otherwise really

346
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
secure drug lords can be easily linked

347
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,480
with an exchange

348
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
in conclusion we found

349
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,600
surprising patterns in security

350
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
practices of users that operate on

351
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
online anonymous markets

352
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
i would like to highlight two important

353
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,399
takeaways of our research

354
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,839
although there are some more in our

355
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
paper

356
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
first rather contra intuitively

357
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,240
the clusters of vendors that specialize

358
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
in selling digital items make mistakes

359
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
in their digital security the most often

360
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
while defenders belonging to the

361
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
clusters of successful drug dealers tend

362
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,839
to have the best digital security

363
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
and second we conclude that many vendors

364
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,399
including the highly successful ones

365
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,480
make the mistake of initiating traceable

366
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
cash outs to mainstream bitcoin

367
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,399
exchanges

368
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,560
our findings shine the light on the

369
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
exploitable security decision cyber

370
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
criminals make

371
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
we now know that investing in building a

372
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,120
case against even the seasoned cyber the

373
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
most seasoned cyber criminal

374
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,959
entrepreneur is anything but impossible

375
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
thank you so much for watching as i only

376
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,279
presented a selection of our findings

377
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
here i would like to invite you to read

for now i'll take questions in the q a

380
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,639
and if you're watching this at a later
