00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,559
hello everyone today i would like to

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,639
introduce our recent work privacy

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,799
preserving and standard compatible aka

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
vertical for biology by your channel

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,960
from institute of software chinese

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
academy of sciences an alibaba group and

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,519
commercial characterography testing

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
center of state cryptography

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,840
administration

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,119
i would like to introduce the

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
phylogenetic standardization and flk

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,160
protocol

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
the 3dgp consodium has started the

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
standardization of lg since 2015.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,160
in

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,160
ti-73.501 the 3gpp consortium has

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,719
proposed the 500 authentication and the

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
key agreement protocol that is filejk it

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
enables mutual authentication and key

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
equipment between user equipment and

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,719
home network it also includes mining

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
design parameters from 3g or 4g aka

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,879
it also makes progress on protecting

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,519
users privacy by disloying the plaintext

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
transmission of isopi over the radio

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
whereas the opi is the user's identifier

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,439
in particular isopr is encrypted with

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,880
ecis and the center as an in concealed

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
ico pi or soci which allows the icopi

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,200
caching attack

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
however some recent work found that file

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
jk cannot protect users privacy against

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
active attackers compared with passive

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,400
attacker which only which can only

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
monitor the radio traffic passively an

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
active attacker can emit radio signal

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
actively and distinguish attack ui by

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
replaying its messages

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
the active attacker can link the tag ue

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,520
with its previous session such attack

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,119
such attacks are also known as

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,720
linkability attacks

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,799
the active attacker can monitor the

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,200
target ue or infer the user's real world

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
identity

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
now several kinds of linked video

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
attacks has been have been discovered

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,880
they are the failure messaging ability

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
attack the sequence number inference

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
attack and the encrypted supi replay

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
attack

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
moreover link beta hacks

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
may break file jks protection for ico pi

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
as an attacker can link a 5g target ue

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
with its 3g or 4gk session which

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
includes which includes plain text as

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
api

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
such cross protocol attacks are possible

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,599
in practice

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,080
as many vendors support real things 3d

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
or 4g ak 4g sim cards and the many open

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
source value communication solutions are

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
available

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
an attacker may perform liquidity

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
attacks with a set with acceptable costs

66
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
as in 3g or 4g error thus the

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,440
improvement of file jk is necessary and

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
urgent

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,560
however fixed file jk is not a trivial

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
task as several linguistic attacks must

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
be fixed in one shot

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
and the fix should be compatible with

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
current value specifications

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
as a non

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
as a non compatible proposal will be

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,480
curesome to be deployed in practice

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,360
if it is not compatible with sim card it

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
will require the vendor to change sim

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
cards for all users if it is not

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
compatible with certain networks it will

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
require our license to change their

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
implementations accordingly

83
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,599
as our goal is to fix all linkability

84
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
attacks while preserving sim card and

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,799
iceland compatibilities

86
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,959
so that it can be deployed in a way of

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,120
reusing sim cards and ice

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
implementations where only both

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,799
endpoints need to be updated

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,480
before we give the detail of our

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
proposal i will introduce some

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
background for file jk and linkability

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,159
attacks

94
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,120
the 58 the value k protocol is consists

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
of the initial interface and the chinese

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,560
response phase in the initial interface

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,760
sopr is encrypted with ecis by the ue

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
and ascent to the asian

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,560
in the challenge response phase the

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
issue generates a random challenge

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
denoted by rand and the auth and message

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
the awesome message includes a mac value

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
of round keyed with the ui's long-term

104
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,880
key and a concealed sequence number

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
then the ue takes random as the input

106
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
for sim card command

107
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,880
authenticate the authenticated command

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
will check mac and check the messages

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
firstness if the check on mac fails it

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
will output mac failure if the check

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,360
unfair unfreshness fails it will output

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
synchronization failure if all track

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
pass it will output

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
a response and a session key that will

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
be used for subsequent value

116
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,719
substitution procedures

117
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
in the failure messaging video attack

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
the attacker replace rand and austin

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,639
the target ue will reply with sig

120
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,840
failure

121
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
the nantucket ue will reply with mac

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
failure

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
the sequence number influence attack is

124
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,039
the arrangement of the failure messaging

125
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,479
video attack

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,240
where the attacker can infer the target

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,919
you use sequence number increased

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,000
pattern on the base of illicibility

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,039
in the encrypted icop replay attack the

130
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
attacker can replay the the attacker

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
replaced icoci today

132
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
coci encrypts the target you use as your

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,199
pi

134
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
then the hdm will take all us as the

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
target ue

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
in such attack scenarios the target ue

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,479
will reply with ia with a response the

138
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
nine hundred will will reply with mac

139
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
failure

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,639
next i will introduce our solution

141
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,440
denoted by value aka prime as shown by

142
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
the figure where the difference with

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
value aka

144
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
marked by writer

145
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,639
in particular rgk prime encrypts run

146
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
with the key established by ecis in the

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
initiation phase

148
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
to be more specific ecis consists of

149
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,199
cam algorithm and an ecis stem algorithm

150
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
the ecis cam algorithm established

151
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
establishes temporary keys between the

152
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,800
ue and asia for instance the keys are

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
denoted by kue and occasion

154
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
the ecis stem algorithm encrypts the

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,479
actual payload with the key

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,280
in file jk prime the issue encrypts run

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
with the key and the ue decrypts when

158
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
the width with the same key

159
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,800
only the encrypted brand denoted by run

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
frame is transmitted

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
then the decrypt run is taken as the

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,919
input for sim card

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
it is obvious that neither the input nor

164
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
the output of the authenticate command

165
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
is changed that is vertically prem

166
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,919
provides sim card compatibility

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,440
as as an only options encrypt run

168
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,080
in front of the key frame hxis is

169
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
calculated with rent prime for

170
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,199
comparison

171
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
and the agent also need to decrypt run

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
prime for re-synchronization

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,919
to preserve the message syntax defined

174
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
by 3gpp we employ a encryption scheme

175
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,160
without type of ciphertext expansion and

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,199
has a block size of

177
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,319
128 bit that is aeis

178
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,280
128 in ecb mode which provides as an

179
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,799
implementation compatibility

180
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
jk prime is resistant against failure

181
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,360
message liquidity attack and the

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
sequence number influence attack

183
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,599
in such attack scenarios the attacker

184
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,120
replaces run prime often or random turn

185
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
where run the prime is encrypted with

186
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
the key used in a private session

187
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,280
but in current in the current session he

188
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
ue will decrypt run all run prime with

189
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
the key in current session

190
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,319
then the target ue will

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
will decrypt with a wrong key and result

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
in a wrong round which cannot pass the

193
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
tracker mac

194
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
the nantucket ue will also fail the

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,800
check on mac

196
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
flga prime is also resistant against the

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
encrypted ico pi replay attack where the

198
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,680
attacker replaced isoci

199
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
in such attack scenario seo ci is

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
equipped with the key used in a previous

201
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
session that is html will also use the

202
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
old key to encrypt rand

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,479
however

204
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
all uis will decrypt random prime with

205
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,800
the key for current session and reply

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,680
with mac failure

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
file jk prime does not raise additional

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
bandwidth cost as all

209
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,559
my smart message format from

210
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
preserves the same

211
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,560
it also only introduces limited

212
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
additional time cost from 2 hundred

213
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
percent to 300 percent as shown by the

214
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
table

215
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
the migration from fiverr jk to 5g prime

216
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
may only involve the modification of

217
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
about 20 line of code for both endpoints

218
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
we also perform funnel analysis for file

219
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,360
jk prime with hammering prober for the

220
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
authentication and the secret signals we

221
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,040
followed the lames and the models with

222
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
stabilized by basing and others for 50k

223
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
and approval and prove that lgk

224
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,080
satisfies the

225
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,240
goals for authentication and accuracy as

226
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
in 50k

227
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
for the privacy goals we model the case

228
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,640
of a targa yui and the natake ue with

229
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
respect to an old session by the

230
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
targiyoi and through that valjerke prime

231
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,440
is resistant to all non-liquidity

232
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,839
attacks

233
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
in this work we propose five zlk frame

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
which is a privacy preserving and

235
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
standard compatible aka particle for 5g

236
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
it is resistant to all known liquidity

237
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
attacks and is compatible with sim cards

238
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,399
and as an implementation it may be

239
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
deployed with only software

240
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,480
modifications for both endpoints

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
compared with 50k it only involves

242
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
stereo addition it involves zero

243
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
additional bandwidth costs and only

244
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,920
involves two hundred percent to three

245
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
hundred percent additional time cost

246
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,079
we hope that failure a prem can

247
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,560
contribute to the next phase of 3gb's

248
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
value standardization process

249
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
that is all thanks for your attention
