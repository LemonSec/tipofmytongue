00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
hi i'm ishin zhou from university of

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,719
michigan a quick warning that this talk

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
will include content related to intimate

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
counter violence stalking and harassment

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,760
if this could be triggering i'll give

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,600
you a moment to mute or leave the room

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
today i'll be presenting a collaborative

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,359
work with researchers from cornell tech

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
and northern lifelong on the role of

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,439
computer security customer support in

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
helping survivors of internal partner

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,839
violence

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,440
internal partner violence or ipv is

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
prevalent and can cause severe and long

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
lasting trauma of survivors

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
for statistics in the united states over

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
one in three women and one in four men

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
have experienced rape physical violence

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,800
and or stalking by an intimate partner

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,599
in their lifetime

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
with a transgender community the rate of

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,239
experiencing ipv is over one in two

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
our research was motivated by how

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,920
technology could be weaponized to

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
facilitate ipv

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,159
an abuser can hack a survivor's accounts

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,479
or devices bomb the survivor with

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,880
harmful messages do public shaming

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
through revenge porn among other attack

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,600
mechanisms

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
spyware has played a prominent role in

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
ipv such as in this example when the

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
abuser can see details of the survivor's

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,040
nearby environment through remote camera

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
access

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,960
in norton lifelock's 2020 survey 10

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
percent of respondents reported using an

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,119
app to monitor their internet partners

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,079
messages phone calls emails or photos

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
we identified computer security customer

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
support as a new and promising avenue

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
for helping ipv survivors

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
since professionals that regularly help

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,759
ipv survivors such as social workers and

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
lawyers reported having insufficient

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
tech expertise and best practices to

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,159
deal with tech-enabled ipv

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,280
security clinics for ipv survivors exist

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
in which trained technologists analyzed

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,160
a survivor's digital access and provided

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
personalized advice

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
however these clinics are currently

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
limited to respective geolocations and

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,239
are still navigating challenges in

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
remote operations

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
by contrast computer security support

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,080
agents have training and expertise on

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
products crucial to ipv survivors such

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
as anti-virus software that can cache

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
spyware

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
additionally these support agents often

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
deal with help requests from various

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
issues beyond products such as scam and

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
ransomware

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,879
however helping ipv survivors requires

66
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
extra caution and care since this

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
population has unique threat models and

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
challenges in taking action to protect

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,959
themselves

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
inappropriate responses may traumatize

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
survivors or even escalate the violence

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,120
as the abuser seeks to regain control

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
our research sought to answer what are

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,280
the opportunities and challenges for

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
computer security customer support to

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,800
help ipv survivors

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
to answer the question we conducted a

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
preliminary qualitative analysis of

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
support chat records followed by focus

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
groups with ipv professionals and

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
support practitioners

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
the chat analysis so to understand if

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
support agents receive ipv cases and how

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
they handle these cases

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
whereas the focus groups aim to draw

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
actionable recommendations that both

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,120
cater to the needs of ipv survivors and

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
consider the real-world constraints of

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
customer support

90
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
the chat records we analyzed came from

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,480
the large consumer-facing computer

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,120
security company that has products from

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
anti-virus to vpn and serves millions of

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
customers globally

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
we found that support agents do receive

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,439
help requests from ipv survivors but

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
they do not seem to be sufficiently

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
prepared as they typically focus on tech

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
issues and do not always show empathy to

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
survivor's risk and trauma

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
in one case when the customer mentioned

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
repeated hacking from their ex-husband

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
and a restraining order the support

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
agent replied do not worry about these

105
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
problems if you have the product

106
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,160
installed without acknowledging that the

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
customer is facing significant stress

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
and danger and has many reasons to worry

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,639
to listen suggestions on how customer

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,199
support could better serve ipv survivors

111
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
we conducted five focus groups with 17

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,400
ipv professionals in total

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
we presented three representative chat

114
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,120
scenarios from the previous analysis and

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
guided ipv professionals to discuss what

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
the support agents have done well and

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
what can be improved

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
we then conducted focus groups with

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
support practitioners from four large

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,720
security companies and 11 participants

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,000
in total to evaluate the practicality of

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
ipv professional suggestions and

123
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
identify any potential constraints or

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
challenges for implementation

125
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,160
the focus groups with ipv professionals

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
serve as three principles for computer

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
security customer support in interacting

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,039
with ipv survivors

129
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,360
first acknowledge the limits of security

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
software is important since over

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
promising what the product can do may

132
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
traumatize or mislead survivors

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
while support agents are usually

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,520
expected to advocate for the company's

135
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,400
products in this case security software

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,199
cannot fully protect ipv survivors as

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
they navigate many social and legal

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,560
challenges

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
for example the survivor may still live

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
with their abuser who can then

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
physically access and control their

142
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
devices

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
on a scenario where the support agent

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
said do not worry if the product is

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
installed an attorney stressed that the

146
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,800
agent should instead listen to the

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
survivor and be honest about what the

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,479
product can or cannot do

149
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,479
a counselor added that the agent should

150
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,840
use languages such as this is scary or

151
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
it sounds like you are having a really

152
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
hard time to show that they understand

153
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,318
and empathize the survivor situation

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
support agents could provide survivors

155
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
with critical tax safety advice and

156
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,639
resources but doing this requires

157
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
caution and boundaries

158
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,240
ipv survivors can benefit from tax

159
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
safety resources but they also face

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,479
risks of escalated violence from the

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,039
abuser for routine privacy protections

162
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
such as changing passwords or turning

163
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,919
off location tracking

164
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,000
advice with caution means that agents

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
should have a safety checking for

166
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,560
example asking do you worry that

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
somebody might be listening to or

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
recording our conversation and if it's

169
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,120
not safe offer to reconnect on a safer

170
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
line and let the customer decide whether

171
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,400
they want to do that

172
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
advice with boundaries means that agents

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
should know their expertise lies in tech

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
issues but not beyond

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
examples of other scope advice include

176
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,080
comprehensive ipv related counseling how

177
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
to maintain physical safety needs in

178
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,840
escaping from the abuser and legal

179
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
advice

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
conversations about the other scope

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
topics should be redirected to external

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,319
resources and experts who are

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,360
systematically trained for these topics

184
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,759
example places for referrals include

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,000
hotlines and advocacy groups for ipv

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
survivors

187
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,759
womenslaw.org as an example for legal

188
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
resource and national suicide prevention

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,000
lifeline if the survivor discloses

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,039
suicidal faults

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
some support practitioners mentioned

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
they are doing external referrals

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,280
already to some extent such as directing

194
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
scam victims to government agencies

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
so the procedure and infrastructure are

196
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
in place and the next step is to expand

197
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,360
the repository to include ipv related

198
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
resources

199
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,639
ipv professionals also noted that

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
support agents should let the survivor

201
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,039
decide whether or how to use the

202
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
referred resources and avoid harmful

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,160
labeling for example a counselor said

204
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
the support agent should avoid calling

205
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
the customer a survivor of domestic

206
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
violence instead use the language the

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
customer uses and let the customer call

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,960
it in whatever ways they want

209
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
we concluded our research with three

210
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,879
recommendations for computer security

211
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,280
companies to better address tech-enabled

212
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
ipv through customer support and beyond

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
these recommendations were based on

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,479
insights from both sets of focus groups

215
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,799
and support practitioners in particular

216
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,800
saw their values and practicality

217
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,720
participants from both sets of focus

218
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
groups agreed that training customer

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
support agents to properly handle ipv

220
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,839
cases should be a

221
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,600
priority such training should introduce

222
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
support agents to both technical and

223
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
non-technical aspects of ipv and

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
highlight example scenarios to help

225
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,279
agents recognize relevant cases

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
the trainer should teach agents what to

227
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,399
do and not do

228
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
and additionally it should provide

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
resources for agents to cope with

230
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,800
secondary trauma since bearing witnesses

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
to violence could be heavy and some

232
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
agents themselves might be ipv survivors

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
support agents agreed on the necessity

234
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
of such training as the director said

235
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
their frontline agents do not have

236
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
dedicated training on ipv and is

237
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
critical to raise awareness of these

238
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,839
issues as a starting

239
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,360
point another director added that they

240
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,279
saw the benefit of such training to a

241
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,320
wider audience for example empathetic

242
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,080
language should be used regardless of

243
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
whether they are interacting with

244
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,959
someone with ipv

245
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,120
this should be used across the board

246
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
support practitioners also mentioned the

247
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
need to track ipv cases in their daily

248
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
work to inform relevant decisions

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,959
for example some ipv professionals

250
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,200
suggested an in-house specialized team

251
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
within the customer support department

252
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
with more expertise in dealing with ipv

253
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
cases and less pressure of finishing

254
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,320
cases on time

255
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
to this a director responded that the

256
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,399
company's founder might be genuinely

257
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
interested but they also need to balance

258
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
the idea with business needs

259
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
particularly by understanding if there

260
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,120
are enough ipv cases to justify the cost

261
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
and logistics of setting up the team

262
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
third ipv professionals and support

263
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
practitioners joining forces with each

264
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,560
other creates numerous benefits

265
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,720
a great example is the coalition against

266
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,920
dockerware founded in 2019 which united

267
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
organizations that support ipv survivors

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
digital rights advocacy groups and

269
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,640
several i.t security companies

270
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,399
an enduring partnership provides a

271
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
learning pathway for both parties to

272
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
benefit from each other's complementary

273
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
strengths

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
we further see the opportunity of such

275
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,519
partnership leading to remote security

276
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
clinics for ipv survivors at scale

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
where support agents can help with

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
technical issues and provide basic tech

279
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
safety tips and ipv professionals can

280
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
focus on non-technical issues and

281
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,640
in-depth safety planning

282
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
