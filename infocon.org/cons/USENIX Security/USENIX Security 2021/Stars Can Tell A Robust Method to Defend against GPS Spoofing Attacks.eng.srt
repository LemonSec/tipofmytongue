00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,200
hi everyone my name is jonan liu today

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,519
i'm excited to share with you our work

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,839
jointly done by a lot of colleagues

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,800
advised by professor yalin yang and

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
professor gang wang

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,240
the name of it is called stars can tell

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,640
a robust method to defend against gps

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,880
spoken attacks using aftershow of

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,760
chipset today billions of devices are

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
receiving gps signals but in reality gps

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
spoofing is a demonstrated concerning

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,480
threat

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
due to lack of authentication if both

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,000
gps receivers get a butchering location

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,039
in time

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,480
for example in 2017 ships were fooled by

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
gps buffing in black sea

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,840
in 2018 and 2020 self-driving cars are

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
diverted to dangerous roads

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,120
back in 2011 researchers already pointed

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,840
out stock servers that are available to

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,920
time asynchronously caused by gps

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,199
spoofing

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
a more concerning trend is that spoofers

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
are still evolving

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
first we are getting cheaper from the

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
first demonstration of spoofer which

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,680
cost over five thousand dollars now an

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
attacker can reproduce the attacks using

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,799
about 35 dollars and the hardware is

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,200
commercial the attack code is open

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
source

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
second we are getting stronger and naive

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
spoofer achieves its goals by

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
transmitting 40 db higher exposing

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,400
signals

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,720
but now more seamless attacks can be

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
launched without causing anomalies

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
during the takeover phase

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
and the upcoming phases

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
therefore in our threat model we

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
consider the most powerful

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,759
state-of-the-art single spoofer and we

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
require no physical operation hardware

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,600
mounting configuration change or

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
malware installation

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
the attack can only be launched remotely

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
by transmitting wire signals on the gps

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,479
channels

50
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,600
although spoofer is cheaper and stronger

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
the anti-spoofing method still face big

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,440
trade-offs

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,000
previous methods are either robust

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
expensive or cheap but ineffective

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,760
for example receiver autonomous

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
integrity monitoring it can be

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
implemented on smartphones but it cannot

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
defend against stimulus attacks

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
crosstracking with additional info

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,560
sources

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
for example like wi-fi bluetooth

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
cellular others dns systems which

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
provides location

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,800
seemed to be work

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,120
but previous study and commercial

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
devices have demonstrated the

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
feasibility

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,879
as

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,640
attacking wireless channels

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
simultaneously

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,239
sophisticated signal processing

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,319
they seem to be work as well

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,640
but it requires high-end software

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
defined radio and costing thousands of

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
dollars

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,599
angle arrival is very robust even when

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,599
facing the same as attacks

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
however it also requires additional

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
antenna arrays and high-end software

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
defined radio

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
or other special hardwares

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,159
crypto is the ultimate solution

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,800
but it requires the gps system to

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
upgrade to next generation

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,159
costing billions of dollars and you can

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,200
make the current gps chipsets or not

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
walking

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
this naturally leads us to one question

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,159
can spoofing detector be both robust and

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,360
low cost

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
the answer is yes

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
other than crypto angle arrival is the

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,799
most effective way to detect gps buffing

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
our goal is to derive angle rival in a

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,159
cost friendly way

96
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
our idea is to get angle rivals by

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
synthesizing a directional antenna array

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
using omnidirectional antennas on

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
commercial devices

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
for example in the stacking illustrated

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,480
in the figure

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
we have a low end hardware the

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
smartphone equipped with

104
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,799
omni-directional antenna

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
then we attach the receiver to a signal

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
blocking material human body to make the

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
antenna directional

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
we rotate the receiver with the blockage

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
together

110
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,880
then the signal strength fluctuates due

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
to different receiver gain at different

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,400
direction

113
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,639
for example with facing the gps signal

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
source we got the highest strength

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,919
corresponding with the angle rival in

116
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,000
backspacingness we got the lowest

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,199
strength

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
and we can synthesize the angle rivals

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
from this greatest sine wave from a

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,639
single satellite

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,320
by combining multiple satellites

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
together

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,800
spoofing can be easily detected

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
here we show two phase sine wave paths

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,479
where the peaks are the angle rivals we

126
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,040
calculated and the dashed lines

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
are the ground shoes

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,919
on the left side different signals from

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,639
different satellites spread apart

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
and the derived angle rival is different

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
on the right side however

132
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
moving signals with different satellite

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
ids they align together and all the

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,160
angle rivals are the same

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
so this can help us to distinguish

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
whether it's spoofing or non-smoothing

137
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,080
based on this intuition we propose three

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
algorithms

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
the first method captures the difference

140
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,120
between angular rival and the ground

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
truth which we call angle of ephemeris

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
to compute aoe

143
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,520
we need at least three things

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
undevised effemorous file

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
current location and time

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,039
but we realize that under spoken case

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,360
there is no such thing as accurate

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
location and time

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
so we also consider two other ways

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,600
using the three statistical patterns of

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
these signals

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
the first is angle arrival

153
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
depth which computes the deviation among

154
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,000
different aoas

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
and the next is the cn0 core

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
which is the time series the signal

157
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
strength

158
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
and then we compute the correlation

159
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
between different satellites

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
we evaluate these different methods

161
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
under different settings

162
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
we have two representative

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
environments

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
open air and urban canyon

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
and we vary the blockage from human body

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,759
to metal sheets we also take acids and

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,080
legality issues seriously for all the

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
spoofing cases we make sure the

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
attacking signals are not emitted into

170
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
the air and they are either collected in

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,840
the chamber or

172
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,880
underground here comes our first

173
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,360
evaluation on accuracy

174
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
we present

175
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,360
the plot of roc curve

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
which tells us the trade-off between

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
false positive rate and true positive

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
rate

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
all three methods they achieve 100

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
percent true positive rate when the fast

181
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
party rate is zero

182
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,919
in more sophisticated scenarios few

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
statistics based approaches are

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,440
sufficiently good the aoa dev and cn

185
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
zero core

186
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,520
presents one hundred percent true

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
quality rate when the fast particle rate

188
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
is zero

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
the next thing we evaluated is detection

190
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
accuracy versus time

191
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,919
in both settings we achieved an accuracy

192
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,479
of one hundred percent in five seconds

193
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,199
note that we are evaluating this on low

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,479
end chipset

195
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,800
and the report rate is as low as one

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
hertz which means the results are good

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,080
when only five samples are considered we

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
can definitely accelerate this process

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,599
by using a higher end chipset which

200
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,520
reports in 10 hertz or 50 hertz

201
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,479
and this achieves our first goal we are

202
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,039
able to detect the strongest water in a

203
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,240
robust the cheap way

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,720
let's take one step further what if the

205
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,319
sulfur is aware of these defenses

206
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
let's stand in the attacker's shoes

207
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,199
what will they do if they want to get

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
around with our defenses

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
they might mimic the different rotating

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
signal patterns

211
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,199
still the attacker has no direct access

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,759
or visibility to the internal software

213
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,639
or hardware of the gps receiver

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
so the attackers have to guess the

215
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
rotation speed and initial phasing angle

216
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,719
of the gps and modulate the signals

217
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,799
according

218
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,279
let's makes them able to simulate the

219
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
adaptive sine waves

220
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,440
so what we do to defend against it

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
the defender can change the rotation

222
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,160
speed in real time so the rotation speed

223
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,640
of the gps receiver is inherently a

224
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
secret that can be dynamically changed

225
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,360
by the defender

226
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,399
for example the correct guess

227
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,760
rotation speed and initial angles

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
resulting underlying signals when

229
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,000
fitting the sine waves which pass

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
through our defenses

231
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
however incorrect guess at rotation

232
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
speed or facing angle can lead to

233
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,240
inauthentic

234
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
signal patterns

235
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,000
this observation inspires our first

236
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
detection method

237
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
it is called average over a cycle the

238
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
main intuition is that when rotating

239
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,240
multiple cycles we can actually average

240
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,720
out the incorrect guess on the face

241
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,200
domain

242
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
through rotating many cycles slicing

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
them into

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
many different degree slots and average

245
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,399
the measurements in each slot

246
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,080
when we

247
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
rotate as many cycles as possible

248
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,959
we can actually average out the

249
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,160
modulated signals in the fading process

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
and they will only leave

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
the

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,959
rotating signals inside

253
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
our next method is called spectrum

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,959
analysis the intuition is simple we find

255
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,680
that the rotation and modulation waves

256
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
they actually have different frequency

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
components

258
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
and by decomposing this kind of

259
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
frequency component we can not only

260
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,680
detect whether there is an attack or not

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
but we can also get

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,720
the

263
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
um phase

264
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
the unmodulated phase from the smaller

265
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,920
which means we can identify the angle of

266
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,079
the rival from the

267
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,880
different satellites as well as the

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
smoking signals

269
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,760
we evaluated once again the accuracy of

270
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,480
the detection methods when we apply the

271
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
adaptive spoken attack against basic

272
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,600
detection we found that those two

273
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
previous methods performed really bad on

274
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
this classification problem

275
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
however when we are

276
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,519
using the advanced detection

277
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,600
they actually got a lot better

278
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
especially when you are looking at the

279
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,079
open air cases and you can perform quite

280
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,480
well on urban canyon cases

281
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
and we also evaluated the time to deal

282
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,600
with it and you can see now we might

283
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
need more time to deal with it but we

284
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
can also achieve our goals within 30

285
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
seconds

286
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
here comes our takeaways

287
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
we propose a new method for gps moving

288
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,839
detection that works on off-the-shelf

289
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,360
gps chipsets

290
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,760
and we explored both basic attacks and

291
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,160
adaptive effects and introduced

292
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
additional measures to fortify the

293
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
defense

294
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,440
we implemented proposed message and the

295
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
adaptive attacks

296
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,560
our method achieves a high accuracy in

297
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,800
five seconds

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,760
thanks everyone for your attention

299
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,519
