00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
welcome to my presentation of our

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,320
large-scale interview study on

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
information security in and attacks

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
against small and medium-sized

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
enterprises my name is nicolas suerman

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
and i will be guiding you through this

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
presentation

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
so let's start with some introduction

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,320
first of all cyber crime as a whole has

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
been on the rise in recent years

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,119
in small and medium sized enterprises

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
specifically cyber attacks like emo chat

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
or general ransomware attacks have

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
significantly increased especially in

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,440
the last year with the pandemic on the

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,399
rise

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,640
small and medium-sized enterprises are a

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,600
major focus of cyber attacks mainly

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
because they have limited resources

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
compared to larger companies and

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
therefore represent easier targets for

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
attacks so far data collected about

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
cyber crime mainly focuses on yearly

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
reports from different countries that

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
focus on measuring the prevalence of

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,480
cybercrime and the types of cybercrime

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,479
on the rise and providing security

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
recommendations for companies

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,320
for our project however we want to look

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,640
at the potential influences that

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
increase the risk of attack

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
for small and medium-sized enterprises

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,159
for that we want to focus on the

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
company's perception of security the

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,159
security measures they have deployed the

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
cyber attacks they have encountered

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,560
previously and how these three factors

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
are related so let's talk really quickly

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
about our approach to collect this data

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
we conducted computer assistant

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,680
telephone interviews short car teas with

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,079
5000 small and medium sized enterprises

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,240
in germany for these car t's we have

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,880
decided to get a large sample of small

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
and medium-sized enterprises

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
1000 enterprises per size category in

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,560
the common categorizations of small and

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
medium-sized enterprises meaning 10 to

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
49 employees 50 to 99 employees etc

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
we have also gathered 500 large

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
enterprises in order to compare them to

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,719
the three previous sizes

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
we have tried to gather a representative

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,119
sample by selecting our industries based

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,800
on their industry sector in a

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
representative manner

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
so industry sectors like trading

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
education energy and farming

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
will have a representative amount of

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
companies within each of these size

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,599
classes

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
other than that we have also collected

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
500 enterprises providing services of

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
general interest that will be analyzed

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,959
in further studies

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,720
before talking about the focus of our

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
survey we first want to talk about how

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,680
we designed and created the survey

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
we started with a simple design phase

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
consisting of a literature review and

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
six expert interviews with

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
input from regional business advisory

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
councils in germany then continued with

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
the recruitment and collection of our

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
stratified sampling

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
on the site of the cartier provider

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
while the authors also conducted

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
discussions with 12 security experts on

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
the initial draft of an interview guide

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,599
and then tested set interview guide in

81
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,239
pilots with five small and medium-sized

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,519
companies

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
using this we finalized the interview

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
guide to be encompassing and

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,959
comprehensive

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
and then proceeded to conduct training

87
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,519
with the

88
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,680
141 telephone interviews from the

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
company conducting the carti interviews

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
before then executing the

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
telephone interviews during the time

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,440
span from august 2018 to february 2019.

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
in the time after that the company

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,599
providing interviews

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
conducted quality checks on the data

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,840
anonymized the interview data

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,360
appropriately and then directed the data

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
to us where we could conduct open coding

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
on the fields that we needed for this

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,760
evaluation

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,319
and then continue with the evaluation by

102
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,680
ourselves

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
now on to the focus of our survey

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
we have focused on four main areas

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,519
largely related to our research

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920
questions first the company perception

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
so the risk perception and the security

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
awareness inside the company

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
second security measures like firewalls

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
antivirus employee training and more

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
third cybercrime incidences like

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
phishing ddos ransomware and more

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
and fourth company demographics like

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,680
budget the size of the company the the

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
amount of tech employees and more

116
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
as part of our results i'd like to talk

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,639
about a few of the demographics we found

118
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,520
first of all 83 of our companies in our

119
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
data set were older than 10 years so

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
there were only very few younger

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,280
companies

122
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
and

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,720
around 40 of all companies in our data

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,680
set

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
reported conducting export activity

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,040
as it turned out the interviewee

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
position was especially important for

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
almost all of our results

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
where the person representing the

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,759
company in our carti interviews

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,720
was

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,680
in almost 70 of the cases tech or

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
information security staff from the

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,479
company

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,680
and in

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,199
23 of the cases a representative member

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
of the management more interview

138
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
positions will be in the paper but these

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,759
two were the majority

140
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,080
other than that 58 of the companies in

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
our data set reported having an i.t

142
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,320
department in-house and almost 74 of all

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,039
companies report having dedicated staff

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,520
for information security in-house for

145
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
the evaluation we mainly conducted

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,840
regressions across the dataset in order

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,960
to find

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
interesting correlations and tendencies

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
before we talk about more specific

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
findings in general we found that the

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
interview position was an important

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
factor for almost all of our regressions

153
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,919
indicating a bias in reporting

154
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,280
depending on the interview position

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
and we noticed that the self-reporting

156
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
quality of concrete incident counts was

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,039
likely of low quality more detailed

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
other than the paper

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
but because of that we decided to focus

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
on incident occurrence instead of

161
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
incident counts for the reminder of this

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,479
evaluation

163
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
we have found that companies report high

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
security awareness across staff and

165
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
management

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,120
and have a low estimation of attack risk

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
for their individual company

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
we found that many companies especially

169
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
found that they were at low risk of

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
targeted attacks this however clashes

171
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
with our further findings like the

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
prevalence of phishing and successful

173
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,479
phishing attacks in companies therefore

174
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
we think this might be a misconception

175
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
by the company staff that should be

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
investigated continuing to security

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
measures we found that basic technical

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
measures like antivirus software

179
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
firewalls security updates etc have been

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
deployed across all companies

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
independent of factors like size and

182
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
industry sector only small companies

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,720
tend to have lower amounts but we found

184
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
that at least 80 of all smaller

185
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
companies employ all technical measures

186
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
that we

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
inquired for this study

188
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,720
however regarding more organizational

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
and human factor related measurements we

190
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,880
found lower distributions

191
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
especially measurements like emergency

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
drills and information security

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
certifications had low deployment across

194
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
all company sizes but even basic

195
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,360
measures like employee training and

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
incidence response plans were not found

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,039
for at least 50 of all of our small

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
enterprises

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,319
this might correlate with the low risk

200
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,960
and awareness that we found and finally

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,479
regarding incidences we found

202
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,639
interesting distributions on the left

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
you can see a heat map that on the

204
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
x-axis has all of the attacks that we

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,680
asked for on the y-axis holds industry

206
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
sectors incidences like phishing were

207
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
commonly encountered within the last 12

208
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
months and had to be react to so where

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479
to some extent successful

210
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
within our data set across all industry

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,599
sectors we also found that specific

212
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
industry sectors were more likely to

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
have encountered specific attacks

214
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
for example 27.9

215
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,919
of

216
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,639
companies in the energy and gas sector

217
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,599
reported having encountered ceo fraud in

218
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
the past furthermore we found that in

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
the sector of communication 17.8 of all

220
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,039
companies of that sector had encountered

221
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,440
a ddos attack before

222
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
within our more detailed findings we

223
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
also found that companies with a higher

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
coverage of security measures tended to

225
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,399
report higher counts of incidences while

226
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,799
we can't use the data set to discover

227
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
the cause of this we think it might

228
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
indicate the potential for missed

229
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,200
attacks by smaller companies

230
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,599
or companies with fewer security

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,959
measurements

232
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
we provide more detail on these results

233
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,680
in the paper so before we conclude

234
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
i also want to talk about a few of the

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
recommendations that we derived from the

236
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
data that we found for companies our

237
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
recommendation would be to

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,160
investigate the discrepancy in security

239
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,880
awareness between the employees and the

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,839
management staff of the company

241
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
for legislators we found that industry

242
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
sectors with higher legislative security

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
requirements tend to report lower

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,560
incidence counts

245
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
therefore we think that security

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
policies could be an important tool to

247
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,680
control the direction and efforts of

248
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,920
companies towards it security

249
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,320
we provide more and more detail on these

250
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
recommendations in our paper

251
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
finally we would like to talk about

252
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
future work and recommendations that we

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
can actually make for researchers

254
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
first of all we would like to

255
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
investigate the discrepancy we found

256
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
between attacks like phishing

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,480
being a problem for a large number of

258
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
companies within our data set in the

259
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
last 12 months

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
and the security awareness for potential

261
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
attacks still being low

262
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,279
second of all we would like for other

263
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
correlations we found like the

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,519
correlation between industry sectors and

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,200
attack vectors

266
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
to be further investigated to find

267
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
actual causes

268
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
and get more in-depth results on why

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,240
certain industry sectors report more

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
attacks in our data set

271
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
furthermore a pretty concrete finding

272
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
from our paper was that the interview

273
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,720
position had a significant influence on

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
all self-reported statistics this is to

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,959
some extent

276
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,360
to be expected however we found this in

277
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,000
all areas and therefore recommend future

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
research on

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
small and medium-sized enterprises to

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
consider what kind of employees in the

281
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,279
company they want to

282
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,000
do research on since employee positions

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
like management and i.t had such a

284
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
significant influence on the results

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,399
that we found

286
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
as a key takeaway we think that

287
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
information security has arrived in

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
companies we see that from the technical

289
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,079
measures that we found across all

290
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,560
companies however in practice security

291
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
might still have quite a few

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
flaws since especially the factor human

293
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,880
formed in employee trainings and risk

294
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
awareness across the company is not

295
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
appropriately considered in all

296
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
companies

297
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,079
thank you very much for listening to

298
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
this presentation

299
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,000
and i will now be glad to answer any

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
remaining questions and discuss the

301
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
paper in the following q a session
