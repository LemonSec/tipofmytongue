00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
hello everyone the title of my

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,559
presentation is research on the security

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,559
of various region capture

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,000
i'm hydrangea

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
university

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
temperature is an effective mechanism

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,720
for protecting computers

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,439
from malicious computer programs and

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,640
both

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
each type of chemistry scheme

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
corresponds to a specific air problem

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,280
until difficult for kind of computer

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
programs to solve

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,320
but is easily solvable by humans

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,160
text-based captures have long been the

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,960
most widely used game because they are

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,680
simple structure and low cost

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
textbook captures adopted the

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
temperature recognition task and the

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
underlying ai problem

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
with advanced instrumentation and

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,359
correct recognition technologies

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
most text-based captures have been

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,760
solved

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
compared to the test-based capture

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
image-based captures can contain more

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
abundant information

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
with more categories and more diversity

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
in many content

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
and thus it seems to be more secure than

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
the test-based game

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
however with the rapid development of

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
computer video techniques

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,040
in hand improving and solving

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
temperatures based on image

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
or update recognition is not a challenge

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
for machine

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
mirroring countries are also a new type

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,479
of image based culture and relies on

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,960
real reasoning tasks

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,439
the realism task includes multiple ai

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
problems at the same time

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
such as update recognition

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,200
semantic complication and relational

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
reasoning

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
there are four commercial service

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
providers

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
tencent g text maintenance and djing who

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
have now proposed the visual reasoning

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
captures to defend against the bots

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,639
the main object categories in the

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,120
existing video reading schemes are

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
showing table

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,040
there are four update categories

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
which is

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,879
regular geometries geometries

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,480
chinese characters

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,280
english letters and digits the four

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
reason visual reasoning schemes adopt

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,720
one or more object categories in their

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
design

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,599
this template presents the first attempt

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
to solve middle reason temperatures we

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,519
implanted a holistic attack and a model

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,800
attack

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
this figure gives a outline of our

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,120
elastic mode

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
which consists of a input mode a reads

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,280
mode

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
and auto model

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
the input model is designed to extract

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
semantic features and global viewer

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
features

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
the reason model is designed to

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
determine which part of the test

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
instruction

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
and the global variable feature vector

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
are the most relevant to each region

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
step

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
following the following principle of the

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
max cell

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
and the outer model is designed to

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
predict the probabilities of

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,519
distribution

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
of all candidate career sales

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
the final attack results are 67.3

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,560
66 percent

88
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,440
77.8 and 86.5 percent

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
respectively

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,519
it proved answer behind success for

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,400
proofing of various encounters

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
the highest success rates of our tax or

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
social enterprising cultures are not as

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
skilled as

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
participant

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,560
as expected

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,080
to take the robotics of our quality

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,400
holistic model we faced with new

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
variations we conducted two groups of

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
summer supply supply military

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
experiments

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,239
robustness to higher video logical

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
complexity and robustness to new object

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
categories

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
the results shouldn't as long as the

106
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,120
chemistry is due based on

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
various tasks

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,040
our machine can achieve a high attack

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,759
performance after fine tuning on only a

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
small number of newly collected samples

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,919
they completely analyzes the reasons for

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,479
the failure cases of holistic muscle and

113
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
the fundamental main reasons

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
for value are different for different

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
times

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
some failure samples for our horizon

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
mode model actually model

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
the failures can be attributed to four

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
main courses

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
classification and grid prediction

121
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
semantics passing and abstract

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
attribution

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
for the classification

124
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
analysis the module learns the features

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
corresponding to some subtle attributes

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,919
that appear only in relation to specific

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,120
challenges

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199
for the grid prediction we know it is

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,919
that model in quickly outputs a great

130
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,720
cell and is close but not identical to

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
the uncirculated cell

132
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,880
what the semantics passing you know

133
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
means the model fails to extract

134
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,240
technological relationships expressed in

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,960
natural language instructions

136
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,680
was abstract attributes enough means the

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
number of the class of

138
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,240
symbols means and antonyms

139
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,160
pronunciations components and other

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,560
attributes are larger on chinese-based

141
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,039
countries

142
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
our holistic network can show remarkable

143
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,160
performance

144
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,039
in breaking media reasoning temperatures

145
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
however when a temperature involves up

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
to abstract attributes our holistic

147
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,039
model does not work well

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
if we could manage to obtain abstract

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
attributes of all foreground objects and

150
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
then integrate them into the process of

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,120
completing the viralism task

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,199
this problem could be solved

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
that's the hardest idea we developed a

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
modular muscle

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
the framework of a modern musculation

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,120
figure

157
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,039
it consists of four models for segment

158
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
passing model detection mode

159
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
classification model and integration

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,319
mode

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,600
the schematic passive model breaks down

162
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,560
the show text instruction into the

163
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
corresponding reason procedures

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
the detection model is to locate the

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
positions of all foreign objects

166
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
the classification model is to recognize

167
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,759
video attributes such as

168
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
notch fracture tilt direct directions

169
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,160
and correct categories

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
another integration model is to cut out

171
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,280
a sequence of program-based filtration

172
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,479
operations

173
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,719
to obtain a predict answers

174
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
the results of our modular tank are 88

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,160
80 potential 86.2 and 98.6 percent for

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
the 10 cent gtex that is under the

177
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,199
insurance games respectively

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
compared to the holistic model of the

179
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
modular

180
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,639
massively higher

181
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
in higher in accuracy

182
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,759
but inferior in inflation

183
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,639
our modular attack is based on a modular

184
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
design process to fairly evil

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,720
evaluate the contributions of each of

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,520
the three model of attack performance

187
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,080
ablation study we studied the

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,479
contribution of the semantic capacity

189
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,599
model

190
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
the contribution of the detection model

191
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,440
and the contribution of the

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,440
classification

193
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
our experimental attacks on viral region

194
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
countries not only reveal the weakness

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,000
and

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,560
variables but more importantly help us

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
better understand what kind of

198
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,240
or design features contribute to good

199
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,440
security based on the observation of the

200
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
effectiveness of the different design

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
features of visual reading captures

202
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,759
we summarize three guidelines for future

203
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
temperature design

204
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
and could make these types of curvature

205
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
harder to crack

206
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
first into using a large category set

207
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
using more categories in country design

208
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,599
result in a larger critical solution

209
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
space than the ambulation support master

210
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,800
search

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
and thus provides better security

212
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
the second is using more variations

213
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
variation refers to objects in the same

214
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,240
category and appear something different

215
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
but remain the same in their outline and

216
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,240
basic features

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
the third is making some conclusion

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
occlusion refers to the case in which

219
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
the view of object is partially blocked

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
by another object

221
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,760
making

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
making some occlusion will enhance the

223
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,279
security of our countries

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
and the last one is the communist

225
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
knowledge

226
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,680
abstract consent can become regarded as

227
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
a type of conscience knowledge

228
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
the ability of the holistic model to

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,200
address abstract consent resulting

230
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,279
81.9 percent of its failures

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,320
on vdd tests based on chinese characters

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
and the modular masses can solve only a

233
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,200
limited subset of challenges based on

234
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
abstract concept

235
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,680
the body of conscience knowledge held by

236
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
humans is nearly infinite

237
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
all these experimental results challenge

238
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
solving problems based on conscience

239
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
knowledge is indeed a completely um

240
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
complex test

241
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
for current machine learning and deep

242
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
learning axums

243
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,519
the high abstractness and the infinite

244
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,079
scope of conscious knowledge greatly

245
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,880
increase the problem completely on the

246
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
floor machine

247
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,279
finally we give some conclusions

248
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,519
it's probably the hard air problems

249
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,800
online current exists in countries and

250
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,959
the fundamental conventional country

251
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
schemes have been proven to be obscure

252
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
they comprehensively studied the

253
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,079
security of four real

254
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,720
reasons schemes and proven the last

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,480
effort to use normal hard air problems

256
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
and that is very reason

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
for countries and not yet succeed

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
and we further summarize three

259
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
guidelines for future video related

260
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
country design

261
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
the adoption of companies knowledge in

262
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
computer design has a promising

263
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,959
prospects

264
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
thank you for listening

265
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,800
and if you have any questions please

266
