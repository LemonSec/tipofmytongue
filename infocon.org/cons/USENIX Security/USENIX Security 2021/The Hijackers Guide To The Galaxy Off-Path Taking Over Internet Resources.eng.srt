00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
hello and welcome to the hijacker's

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
guide to the galaxy off path taking over

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,360
internet resources i'm philipp geithner

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
and i'm one of the authors of this paper

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
so first we will look at an overview

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
we will look at how to how digital

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
resources and providers are managed and

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
what type of resources and providers we

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,519
need then we will look at how to take

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,120
over those resource holders accounts to

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,920
hijack the resources in those accounts

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
we will look at how many vulnerable

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
customers they are and what potential

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
resource manipulations you could do when

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,399
you have

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
access to such an account

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
we look at the vulnerable resources and

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,800
finally we will look at counter measures

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
and provide conclusions

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
so first what type of digital resources

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,280
and providers do we even mean

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,320
we mean

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,280
essentially resources like domain names

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
internet addresses of ip addresses or

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,799
certificates for tls

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
such resources are typically managed via

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
providers and

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,400
to manage

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
these resources you have an account at

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
the provider so essentially it's the

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
same as to log in into an into your

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,840
email account but here you log into an

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
account which manages those resources

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
for example which manages the ip address

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
space and if you for example want to

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
sell the address space to someone else

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
you go to the account and tell the

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
provider that you sold it

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
so

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
for our data sets we looked at four

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
different types of resources we looked

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
at all the regional internet registries

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,880
where you manage your ip address

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
allocations we looked at registrars like

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
godaddy where you manage your domain

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,840
names

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
and cloud providers like google or

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,719
amazon where resources like mutual

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
machines and other cloud resources are

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,880
managed and finally we look at

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,360
certificate authorities where you manage

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
tls certificates for example you can

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
renew them

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,440
and for our customer data set we look at

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
75 of the customers of irs and also the

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,440
100k top alexa domain list

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
so the question is how to attack those

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
providers and take over an account

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
our tag works by hijacking the password

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
recovery email

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
for the account

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
and essentially since emails

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
are rooted through the dns or the

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
routing information for emails is stored

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
into the dns

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
our attack works by poisoning the dns

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,840
cache for the victim domain in the

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
resource providers resolvers

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
with a poisonous entry which maps the

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
email server of the victim to the

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
attacker's ip address

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
the attacker then triggers a password

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,879
recovery email for the victim domain or

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
the victim account

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
and resides the password for the account

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,599
this allows him to take over the account

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,920
via essentially registering the password

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,280
and logging into the account

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
so the question is essentially how to

80
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,640
poison the resource providers resolvers

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
cache

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
and to do this there are several

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
methodologies but we evaluated three

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
which are bgp prefix hijacks side

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
channel attacks also called set dns and

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,920
also ipre fragmentation attacks

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,040
and we found that for the bgp subprefix

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,959
and fragmentation attacks

89
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
most of the providers we tested are

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,519
vulnerable to such an attack

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
while for the side channel attack only

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
some of the providers are vulnerable

93
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,280
so

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
the other question besides the

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
vulnerable providers are the vulnerable

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
customers

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
for a customer to be vulnerable

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,239
essentially we have two properties which

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
need to be fulfilled

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
first the customer's account details

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,319
which are needed to trigger the password

102
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,799
recovery need to be somehow known to the

103
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,319
attacker

104
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,959
and we find that since for the most

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,879
providers you only need the email

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
address of the account

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,040
to trigger the password recovery you can

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
actually find these email addresses in

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
75 of the cases

110
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
for the

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
ir who is accounts just from the public

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
who is databases because the public who

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
is databases lists many email addresses

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
which belong to these

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
resources and one of them is certainly

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,080
the

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,759
email address which is linked to the

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,120
account

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,080
the same applies to 11 of the alexa 100k

120
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,199
domains

121
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,800
where the different essentially comes

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
from that in the case of domains the

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,840
details are typically

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
privacy protected which is not the case

125
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
for the ir whois databases

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
and even if this is not possible the

127
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
account identifier which needs to be

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,759
entered into the web interface can often

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
be guessed for example because the

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,759
resource holder uses an email address

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
like ipmanagement at provider.com or

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
knock for

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
knock at company.org

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
and the second property for a customer

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
to be vulnerable is essentially the name

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
server configuration of the

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
domain which serves the or

138
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
for the domain where the account email

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,840
address is hosted

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
and depending on the poisoning

141
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
methodology

142
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,720
we evaluated we find that 11 to 56 of

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
the accounts are vulnerable to these

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
attacks

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
so next we will look at what kind of

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
manipulation of resources is possible

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
under those providers

148
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,639
for our test case we will look at the

149
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
attacks which are managed via the sso

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,160
accounts of lars on the ripe ncc

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
and for such an account at write and see

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
we list different types of actions which

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
the attacker can do once he has access

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
over the account

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
first the attacker could do

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
could manipulate the rpti status of the

157
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,600
resources or the network blocks of the

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,639
victim

159
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
essentially what he can do is he can

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
create remove or modify existing root

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
origin announcements which means that he

162
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
can either disrupt propagation of bgp

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,960
announcements or he can expose an

164
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,319
already rp a protected network to bgp

165
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
hijacking

166
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
the next thing the attacker could do is

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,039
to manipulate the right database so the

168
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,360
whois database

169
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,600
to either allow impersonation of the

170
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
alar representatives or to re for

171
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
example

172
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,840
make other

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,680
networks refuse bgp ranks of the

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
customer because the

175
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
bgp routers might use the data from the

176
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,840
who is to filter bgp announcements

177
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
furthermore the attacker could

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
essentially change the user details of

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
the account

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
so for example he can

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
basically create new users under the

182
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,199
same

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
organization which also have

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
which also have access to the same

185
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
resources and so they can still manage

186
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
those resources even if the victim

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,599
sees that the account has been hijacked

188
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
and might reset the password

189
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
the attacker can also modify the alar

190
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
contacts or details so he could even

191
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
hijack essentially the post address of

192
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,599
the lar account and so even hard copies

193
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,440
of contracts etc won't go to the correct

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
address anymore

195
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
the attacker can also terminate the lar

196
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,199
membership which would essentially

197
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,919
delete all the customers accounts

198
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,479
resources

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,199
and finally the attacker can also

200
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
initiate a transfer of internet resource

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,879
or address-based blocks

202
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
and essentially sell the address

203
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
resources of the victim to another party

204
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,919
and this is especially effective if the

205
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,479
attacker colludes with the buyer of dip

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
resources because then it is easy to

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
fake contracts which show that

208
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,759
both the

209
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
victim and the buyer essentially

210
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,199
signed the contract which is a

211
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,680
requirement for the

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,599
transfer to be made so you have to send

213
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,479
a

214
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,958
scan of a contract

215
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,958
which is signed by both parties but

216
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,760
since such a scan might be easily forged

217
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,880
and in the case of a colluding the buyer

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,440
is even basically also the attacker this

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
is not really a different thing to do

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
we also evaluated other resource

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,519
manipulations at other providers for

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
example

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
domain registrars certification

224
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
authorities and cloud providers which we

225
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,120
listed in the paper

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
finally the question is how many

227
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
resources are vulnerable to our attacks

228
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
so essentially we looked at the ip

229
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
addresses and domains and found that

230
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
from the public rules records

231
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,839
that even though

232
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,519
not only 50 roughly 50 of the

233
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
accounts are vulnerable

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
roughly 80 of the ip addresses are

235
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,640
vulnerable to our attacks because the

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
bigger network blocks seem to be more

237
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
vulnerable or the accounts which manage

238
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
more ip resources seem to be often or

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
more vulnerable than smaller accounts

240
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,880
we also found that for domains roughly

241
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
half of the alexa 100k domains are

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
vulnerable to our attacks

243
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,080
via bgp hijacks which

244
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
is

245
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,279
is smaller for the other

246
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
cache poisoning methodologies

247
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,240
overall we see that 93 of ip addresses

248
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
and

249
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
64

250
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
65 of the domains are vulnerable to our

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
attacks

252
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
so next we provide recommendations for

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
countermeasures

254
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,839
our first category of counter measures

255
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,720
are measures who to make it harder to

256
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,959
take over the account and these counter

257
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
measures are to hide public account

258
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
details and to use separate systems for

259
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
high privileged accounts to make it

260
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
harder for an attacker to actually get

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,839
access to the systems

262
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
the second set of counter measures are

263
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
aimed towards making it harder to

264
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,920
manipulate resources

265
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
and the counter measures we provide here

266
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
are two-factor authentication which

267
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
should be enforced for all customers

268
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,440
account notifications for changes in the

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
accounts and access

270
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
restrictions

271
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
additionally a manual review process for

272
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
have high value transactions might

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
prevent attacks to actually complete

274
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
finally we will also provide conclusions

275
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,160
we conclude that the resource databases

276
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,839
are poorly protected and that

277
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
adversaries can take over the accounts

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,720
and can manipulate the resources

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
we also saw that the attacks are

280
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
relatively practical and that a large

281
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
fraction of providers and customers are

282
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
potentially vulnerable

283
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,240
also the attack is even interesting for

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
on-path attackers which have already

285
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,000
access to the dns queries

286
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
and finally we show that fixes exist but

287
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
they are not not always enforced for

288
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
example strict authentication via

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
mandatory two-factor authentication

290
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,399
might actually drive customers away and

291
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,120
that might make the providers not make

292
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
that mandatory

293
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
finally this was my presentation thank

294
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,240
you and goodbye

295
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,800
you
