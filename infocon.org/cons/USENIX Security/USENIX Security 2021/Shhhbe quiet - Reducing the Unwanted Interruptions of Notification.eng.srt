00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,480
hello everyone my name is igor and in

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
this presentation i'll tell you more

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
about our work on reducing unwanted

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,119
interruptions due to notification

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,039
permission prompts on chrome

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,800
this is a joint work with several

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,279
colleagues at google

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
operating systems such as windows mac os

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
and linux provide apis that allow apps

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,320
to display push notifications as native

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,160
system notifications

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
chrome like many other browsers

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,960
implements the web notifications api

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
which allows websites to send push

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,520
notifications to users the image here

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
shows a system notification on macos

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,559
that comes from chrome

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,239
but before websites can send

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,480
notifications they should ask for

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
permission and the user should grant it

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,039
there are a few best practices that

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,440
chrome team and mozilla have developed

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,320
independently to help web developers in

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,959
deciding when to ask for permission

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
from a user experience standpoint

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,799
permission problems should be asked

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,960
after the user has shown intent the

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
prompts should appear in the appropriate

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
context and the notifications should be

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
time sensitive and useful

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
for example the website on the left has

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,040
a clear checkbox that allows users to

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
choose to get notified and similarly the

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
website on the right has a visible

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,240
button

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
finally websites should have insight

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
management controls for notifications to

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
make it easy for users to disable them

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
at any time

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,759
so what do the permission prompts look

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
like on chrome

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
on desktop the prompt is displaced as an

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
anchored bubble that shows two possible

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
actions block and allow as well as an x

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
icon that allows to dismiss the prompt

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
users can choose to interact with the

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,600
prompt by either clicking on the allow

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
block or the x icon

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
but they can also simply continue

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
browsing the website and ignore the

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,119
prompt

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
on android the prompt is even more

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
visible and in fact users have to

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
interact with the prompt before they can

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
continue to browse the website

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,040
on ios web push notifications are not

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
supported

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,879
now that we've seen the prompt uis let's

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,120
have a look at some statistics about

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
notification permission prompts

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,440
first if we look at all permission

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
prompts in chrome as reported by clients

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
who choose to send usage statistics and

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,920
crash reports to google we see that 74

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
of those are for the notification

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,200
permission

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,599
but only a very small fraction 10

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,200
percent of desktop and 21 on android are

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
granted

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,959
which means that the vast majority of

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
such prompts are either ignored

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
dismissed or blocked

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,519
and we refer to those as unwanted

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
notification prompts

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
in fact most of the unwanted prompts are

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
either dismissed or simply ignored

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,040
there could be multiple reasons why

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
users do not want to receive

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,599
notifications for example they might be

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
uninterested in receiving notifications

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,480
from that specific site or because they

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
do not wish to be interrupted in general

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
when browsing or also because they feel

84
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
that the site is trying to deceive them

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
for instance by getting the site's

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
content on the permission

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
that brings us to the goals of this

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
project which are to reduce the unwanted

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
notification permission prompts for the

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
majority of users

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
without significantly impacting those

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
who want to receive them

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,040
in this paper we discuss the results of

94
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
two large scale studies of notification

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
prompt usage in the wild where we define

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
proxy measures of unwanted notification

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
prompts

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
we design a new quiet permission from ui

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
and we introduce novel adaptive

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,519
activation mechanisms for the new ui

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
our analysis has shown that the new uis

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,560
and their activation mechanisms have a

103
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
significant positive effect on reducing

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
unwanted notification prompts

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
a decrease of 31 percent of the prompt

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
block rate and only a minimal impact on

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
the wanted ones with less than a five

108
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,959
percent decrease in the allow rate

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
so let's discuss more in detailed

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
studies

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
first we wanted to understand how users

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
interacted with the default permission

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
prompt in the wild

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
for that we analyzed the interactions

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
with the notification permission prompt

116
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
with the allow block dismiss or ignore

117
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,280
actions by a subset of users who opted

118
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
to sharing telemetry with google

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,560
before conducting any experiment with

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
behavioral data we obtained approval

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
from key stakeholders at google

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,479
including from legal ux privacy

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,919
engineering and product

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,320
in order to limit the impact of test

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
accounts or devices we applied several

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
filters to the data and then we computed

127
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
aggregate statistics about the different

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
action rates

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
with regards to the unwanted prompts

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,800
users can take two types of actions

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
one requires an interaction with the

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
prompt and is explicit and those are the

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,199
block or the dismiss

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
actions for example

135
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
and the other one the ignore is implicit

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,080
and does not require any interaction

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
moreover prompts that are blocked are

138
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
also persisted for the site across

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
subsequent visits

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
about the study results so we conducted

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
the first study in march 2020 over a

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,520
10-day period where we analyzed over 800

143
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,160
million actions on more than 70 000

144
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
websites for more than 300 million

145
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
chrome clients the results indicate that

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
80 of desktop clients and 70 of android

147
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,080
ones

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,039
never granted any prompts they saw

149
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,440
however the detailed charts also show

150
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,759
that there is a non-negligible fraction

151
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,319
of clients that always grant such

152
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,440
prompts eight percent on desktop and 26

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
on android

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
it is therefore important to minimize

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
the effect of any change we make for the

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,280
users who want to get the notifications

157
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,680
and that is what we try to achieve next

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,080
that is to reduce the interruptiveness

159
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,160
of unwanted notification permission

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
prompts

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
to get there

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
first we redesigned the notification

163
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,720
prompt ui to make it less interactive we

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
wanted to reduce the number of prompts

165
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
that users have to act upon and at the

166
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,319
same time provide a more obvious escape

167
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
hatch if users wanted to change their

168
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
choice after they made it

169
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
we chose the following ui for desktop

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,280
and android after a small experiment and

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
of course you can find more details

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,599
about that experiment in the paper

173
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,479
then

174
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,960
we introduced a persite activation

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
mechanisms for the new ui which are

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
shown by default on sites that have very

177
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
low average grant rate according to our

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
telemetry

179
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
finally we designed new logics for

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,880
activating these uis based on either the

181
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,199
user's chrome settings to always show

182
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,120
the quiet ui for example

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
but also the past actions for example to

184
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,599
enable the quiet ui after three

185
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,360
consecutive block actions

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
we then run a second experiment to

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
understand the effect of these changes

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
on the main action rates grant deny etc

189
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
we performed an a b test where the new

190
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,319
uis were disabled in the control group

191
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,560
and enabled in the experiment group on a

192
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
subset of desktop and android clients

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
the results based on more than 100

194
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
million actions on more than 70 000

195
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,919
websites from more than 40 million

196
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,960
clients

197
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
show that the new ui has minimal impact

198
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,400
on users who want to get notification

199
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
with the less than five percent

200
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
reduction in grant rate on average

201
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,039
while significantly reducing unwanted

202
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,280
interruptions with the 31

203
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
lower average denier rate and again more

204
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,080
details can be found in the paper

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,319
and this brings us to the conclusion so

206
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,919
we have observed

207
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
that 74 of permission prompts on chrome

208
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,199
are for the notification permission yet

209
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
those are very rarely granted which

210
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,679
means that most of those prompts cause

211
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,240
unwanted interruptions

212
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,719
of the browsing experience for the users

213
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
this made us rethink our notification

214
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,519
permission prompt ui

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
we conducted two large-scale studies to

216
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
better understand the issue and to test

217
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
the effectiveness of our new less

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,839
intuitive ui for the notification

219
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,519
permission together with the crowdsource

220
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,600
signals as well as the user's own past

221
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
actions with the prompt chrome is able

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
to reduce unwanted interruptions while

223
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,360
keeping the utility for the users who

224
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,399
want to see notifications

225
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
as part of our ongoing work

226
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
we are exploring ways to improve the

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
activation logics for the new wise to

228
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,800
make it work better for more cases where

229
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
users are unlikely to grant the

230
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,160
permission

231
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
and we are also considering novel uis

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
for other permissions as well

233
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
such as the cheap ui for the geolocation

234
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
permission which you can try on chrome

235
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
today

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
with that uh i conclude this

as well as the chrome user experience

243
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
reports which shows

244
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
action metrics
