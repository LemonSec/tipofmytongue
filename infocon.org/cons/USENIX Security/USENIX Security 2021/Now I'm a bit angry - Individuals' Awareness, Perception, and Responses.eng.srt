00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,639
welcome to this talk my name is peter

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
meyer in the following my colleague

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
jinzu and i will be presenting our

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,239
investigation into individuals awareness

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,760
perception and responses to data

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,000
breaches that affected them data breach

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
is an event in which private sensitive

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
or confidential personal information is

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,400
leaked to unauthorized third parties

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
for affected individuals exposed data

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,240
can cause tangible harms when it's

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
misused for identity theft or account

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,600
hijacking

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
and even if these events have not

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,440
occurred yet individuals may experience

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,280
emotional harms as they feel vulnerable

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
or anxious about exposed data being

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,239
misused in the future

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,000
the number of data breaches occurring

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,399
over time shows us that data breaches

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,680
are on the rise

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
in the united states there were more

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,879
than 1 000 breaches each year since 2016

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,719
leading to more than a billion exposed

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
records overall

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
however a survey from ponemon institute

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
suggests that the most common reaction

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
to a breach notification stated by 32

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,000
percent of their respondents was to

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
ignore it and do nothing this intrigued

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
us and we wanted to have a closer look

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
at this with the methodology that was

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,720
different from what had been done before

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
prior work primarily asked participants

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
about past experiences with breaches in

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
general or asked them to describe

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
intended reactions in hypothetical

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,560
scenarios

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,799
instead we probe participants with

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,400
real-world breaches that are known to

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
have exposed their personal information

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,880
therefore

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
our survey has a greatly increased

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
ecological validity as participants were

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,439
more likely to relate to these breaches

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,680
this also mitigates recall bias as many

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
participants first learned about

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
breaches in our study and provided

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
immediate responses

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
to achieve this new methodology we built

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,360
our own survey platform that queries the

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,159
api of have i been pwned a web service

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
that allows visitors to enter their

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
email address and see a list of known

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
data breaches tied to that email address

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
we then use the query data to pro

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,160
participants about the specific breaches

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
their email address was a part of

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
thereby our study was guided by five

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
main research questions covering factors

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,879
that influenced the likelihood of an

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,480
email addresses exposure to data

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
breaches participants perception of

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,440
causes and impacts their awareness of

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
data breaches their emotional reactions

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,319
and their behavioral responses

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
in our survey we started by asking

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
participants to provide their most

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
commonly used email address for querying

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
the have a rinponed api followed by

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,319
questions about several properties of

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,480
the email address such as its frequency

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
and purpose of use

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,239
for participants who were affected we

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
presented up to three specific breaches

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
for each breach we collected if they

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
were aware of it before our study their

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
perception of causes and impacts of

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
being affected their emotional reactions

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
and if they've done or intend to do

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
anything in response

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,599
in the end we showed participants the

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,280
complete list of known breaches that

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
included their email address to ensure

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
that they're aware of all risks

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,640
additionally we provided resources to

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
help participants in taking action and

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
dealing with a potential aftermath of

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
data breaches

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
so what did we find

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,599
for first research question we

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,519
investigated the factors that influence

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
an email addresses likelihood of

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
exposure to data breaches and we found

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
that many participants were affected

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
specifically 73 of participants appeared

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
in one or more breaches with an average

98
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
of 5.4 breaches per participant

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
regarding the leaked data types email

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,239
addresses of course appeared in all

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,000
breaches since we used they haven't been

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
pwn data

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,959
other commonly leaked data types in our

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
sample of 189 unique breaches included

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
passwords usernames ip addresses and

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
names

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
we then ran a quasipoisson regression

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
which revealed that an email address's

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
exposure to data breaches increases as

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
it gets used longer

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
specifically the number of breaches

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
associated with an email address

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
increases by 8 percent per year of use

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,799
while 8 percent might not sound like

115
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
much the figure on the right illustrates

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,720
how this effect builds up over time

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
so in summary exposure to data breaches

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
was common and the longer the email was

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,359
used the more likely it was exposed

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
for the research question 2 um where we

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
look at the participants perceptions of

122
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
causes and impacts when affected by data

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
breaches we found that most participants

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
blame themselves

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
53 percent reflected on their email

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,960
practices such as by quoting the email

127
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
addresses extensive use in account

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
registration

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,479
percent viewed other insecure behaviors

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,560
as potential causes such as not being

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,199
careful with what emails they clicked

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,080
and

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,199
only 14 mentioned external factors such

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,280
as the breached companies lacks security

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
measures

136
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
in answering how a breach has or will

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,759
impact their lives participants in more

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
than half of the responses voiced the

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
perception that the breaches would have

140
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
none or very limited impact despite

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
their most commonly used email address

142
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,160
being leaked

143
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
participants who had experienced impacts

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
usually described emotional distress or

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
behavioral changes such as stopping

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,000
answering phone calls by contrast those

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
who haven't experienced impacts usually

148
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
took the breach less seriously and

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
thought the breach would only affect

150
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
older accounts with no sensitive

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,160
information

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
so in summary for research question 2 we

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
found that when asked for the cause of

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
being affected participants mostly

155
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,840
blamed themselves and thought that

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,759
breaches had no impact on their lives

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
with respect to research question 3 and

158
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
the participants awareness of data

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
breaches

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
we found that participants were unaware

161
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
of the majority namely 74 percent of

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,880
breaches and were aware of only 18

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
so

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
in the answer to research question 3 we

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
see that participants were largely

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
unaware of data breaches and with this i

167
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,960
hand over to my colleague yin for the

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
remainder of the talk

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
thank you peter for covering the first

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
half of our talk i'll start by sharing

171
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
our findings on participants emotional

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
responses to data breaches

173
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
participants likely responses reflected

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
a low concern for the breach overall

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
as the median was only somewhat

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
concerned

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,919
certain data types stood out as they

178
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
triggered more concern than others

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,759
namely password physical address phone

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
number date of birth ip address and name

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
all of which received more than 50

182
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
percent somewhat concerned or about

183
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
responses

184
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,360
in response to rq4 we found that

185
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
participant's overall concern level

186
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
remained low

187
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
and password physical address and phone

188
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
number were the top three data types

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
that triggered the most cancer

190
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
regarding participants behavioral

191
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
responses to data breaches

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
participants reported diverse intentions

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,880
for the 10 actions we provided

194
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,440
namely change other accounts password

195
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
and change this account's password were

196
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
more popular than other actions

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
perhaps because password triggered more

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,120
concern than other data types

199
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
other actions like filing complaints or

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
taking legal actions were rarely

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
considered

202
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
possibly because most league data types

203
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,680
were non-sensitive records unlike credit

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
card numbers or government ids

205
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,080
our logistic regression identified

206
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
awareness and concern as key motivators

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
of action

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
the finding about awareness is expected

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
since one needs to be aware of the

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
bridge first in order to take action

211
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,919
regarding concern for one unit increase

212
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,560
on a five point scale the odds of having

213
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
taken action increased by 2.2

214
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
this means that for future intervention

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
efforts could consider raising concern

216
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,479
to encourage the adoption of protective

217
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,440
measures

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
in response to rq5 we found that

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,319
changing passwords was more popular than

220
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
other actions

221
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,160
prior awareness and higher concern were

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,560
key motivators of taking action

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,000
to recap it survey individuals awareness

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
perception and responses to specific

225
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,799
breaches that affected them

226
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,039
we found that exposure to breaches

227
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,679
increases as an email address gets used

228
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,320
for a longer time

229
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
participants were unaware of most

230
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
breaches displayed to them

231
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
most participants blamed themselves for

232
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
being affected and thought that the

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
breach would not impact them

234
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
and lastly

235
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
participants overall concern level

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
remain low yet awareness and concern

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
were key motivators of taking action

238
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
we now highlight some of our studies

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
technical and policy implications

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
first as we found that an email address

241
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
exposure to breaches inevitably

242
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,920
increases as is used longer

243
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,240
one idea is to promote the adoption of

244
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,040
existing tools that help users create

245
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
unique email aliases

246
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,800
for example in signing with apple users

247
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
can provide their email address but they

248
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
can also choose the hide my email

249
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
feature which means apple will create a

250
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,959
random email address for the signing and

251
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,120
forward incoming correspondence to the

252
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
user's actual email address

253
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
as signing with apple as similar tools

254
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
are relatively new more research is

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
needed to understand the motivators and

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,900
barriers behind adopting such tools

257
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,160
[Music]

258
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
second our finding that the majority of

259
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,560
breaches were new to participants

260
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
indicates that current ways of notifying

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
consumers of features

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
may not be effective

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
rather than traditional letter based or

264
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
email notifications we see the advantage

265
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
of in-situ methods

266
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,160
such as the firefox lockwise password

267
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
manager featured here so that users can

268
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
learn about breaches and take available

269
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,600
action in the moment as they visit a

270
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,480
breached site or sort out credentials in

271
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
their password manager

272
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,800
note that effective notifications likely

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
will not happen without strong policy

274
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,560
interventions

275
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,800
we argue that regulators should set

276
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
stricter requirements for breach

277
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
organizations regarding when and how to

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,839
notify

279
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,600
consumers consumers should be notified

280
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
not only for high risk breaches as what

281
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,079
gdpr suggests

282
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
but for all breaches given that the risk

283
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,279
of data breaches is hard to define

284
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
and the emotional toll are still

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,399
concrete harms in legal terms

286
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,560
ideally the notification can be

287
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
delivered in multiple channels to

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
further raise awareness

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,880
and be understandable and usable for

290
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,880
everyone

291
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
moreover notification alone is not

292
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
enough and companies should stay

293
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,959
involved in helping customers recover

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,279
from breaches

295
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
rather than providing free credit or

296
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,240
identity monitoring service which have

297
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
limited preventative protections

298
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,959
regulators can mandate or encourage

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,880
companies to offer more creative

300
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
protection tools

301
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,640
such as email alias generators as we

302
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
discussed before or password managers

303
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,839
both of which can more fundamentally

304
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,920
help consumers manage their online

305
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
presence

306
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,079
this is all for our presentation today

307
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
this research is done by peter mayer
