1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,320
all right good afternoon everyone and

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
thanks for hanging this far into the day

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
thanks pratik for the introduction

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,840
so i'll be talking about protecting the

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
privacy of ble device users

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
i did this work with qhan kim from

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
hewlett-packard labs

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
while advised by professor conquin from

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,840
university of michigan

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,120
so bluetooth low energy also known as

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
ble bluetooth 4.0 plus bluetooth smart

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
as opposed to the regular bluetooth

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,040
we're used to like bluetooth classic

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440
is bluetooth 6 answer to the internet of

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
things

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
it's supposed to provide short-range

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
communication between less powerful and

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
energy constrained devices like your

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
fitbits for example

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719
and more powerful clients like your

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
smartphone now bluetooth sig lists

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
around 74 000 unique products unique

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,519
ble-equipped products on their website

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
in the year 2013

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
more than 1.2 billion ble equip products

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
were shipped with this number expected

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
to hit 2.7 billion devices in three or

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
four years

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
so the most important part of the ble is

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
the lp the low energy part and the

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,720
reason is that the protocol places very

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
low energy burden on these less

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
powerful devices or energy constraint

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,560
devices

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
in fact most of the time these less or

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,560
energy constrained devices spend their

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
time in standby mode where their

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
functionalities network functionalities

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
are turned off

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,799
occasionally they wake up and advertise

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,200
their presence by broadcasting beacons

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,520
to let others know of their presence

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
now on the other hand you have your more

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
powerful clients like your smartphones

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
scanning all the times for these

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
advertisements

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,520
when they receive an advertisement of

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
interest from a device of interest they

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
initiate a connection in which case

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
they'll be in the initiating state

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,720
now if the smaller device responds to

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,200
the connection request both devices will

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
move into the connection stage

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
at this time your less powerful device

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
or your fitbit for example would be the

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
server because it has information to

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
offer and on the other hand your client

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
device will be or your smartphone will

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
be the client because it is fetching the

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
information

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
now this whole connection process and

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
this whole protocol is enabled by

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,519
advertisements a device is supposed to

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,599
advertise its presence to enable scans

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,239
and connections the ble protocol defines

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,840
the three dedicated advertisement

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
channels 37 38 and 39

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
and also defines four types of

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
advertisement

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,239
messages

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
the most important of which are the

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
direct advertisements and the indirect

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
advertisements

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
direct advertisements are those used by

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,319
dle peripherals like your ble keyboard

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
for example so you turn on your ble

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,959
keyboard and start advertising at a very

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,599
high frequency for 1.2 seconds your

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,879
smartphone

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
will be scanning for these

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
advertisements that will only contain

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,720
two fields the source address and the

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
destination address your smartphone

84
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
which will match the destination address

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,560
will pick up the advertisement will

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
connect to it

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
and then we have the more general and

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,519
perhaps the most common type of

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,599
advertisements which is going to be

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,599
featured throughout this talk which is

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,760
that indirect advertisements

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,400
these are periodic or let's say

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,799
quasi-periodic advertisements

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,040
in which a device advertises its

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,159
presence

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
waits for a short amount of time

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
for to accept connections and then

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
sleeps for an advertisement interval

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
which is a predetermined and can vary

100
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,760
between 20 milliseconds and 10.24

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,599
seconds and then and that's very

102
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
important it sleeps for an additional

103
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
random delay between 0 and 10

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
milliseconds and thus vle's version of

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
channel access control is supposed to

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
minimize the probability of collisions

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
of different advertisements from

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,959
different devices now the advertisement

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
message contains the source address of

110
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
the device along with many identifying

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
fields for example like the device's

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,798
name

113
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,680
now having a device regularly present

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
advertising its presence is not very

115
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
desirable from a security and privacy

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
standpoint

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
so the ble protocol designers have

118
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
anticipated that and the protocol

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,199
contains some security and privacy

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,320
provisions

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
mainly they have borrowed the pairing

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
and bonding procedures from the regular

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
bluetooth

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
so that only authorized clients are

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
supposed to connect and access sensitive

126
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
services on your ble device

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
they have address randomization which

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
has been proposed in bluetooth 4.2

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,199
protocol in which the device is supposed

130
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,960
to change its address frequently in a

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
manner that seems random to other

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
sniffers and eavesdroppers but

133
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
predictable and deterministic for an

134
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
authorized client and finally we have

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,560
the advertise the direct advertisements

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
that i just described which are supposed

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
to prevent user tracking because they

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,639
are not periodic and contained to less

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,560
information

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,400
now to evaluate how these privacy and

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
security provisions really effectively

142
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
are really effective in practice we

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,639
developed an android app which basically

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,400
scans for ble advertisements at the

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
vicinity

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
we deployed this app in three different

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
scenarios i while interning hp labs i

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,960
gathered ble advertisements in the area

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
for 40 days

150
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
i also recruited 13 participants from

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,320
our school in ann arbor and we were able

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
to collect data for around two months

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
and also relied on the phone lab testbed

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,639
from sunny buffalo

155
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,400
where i was able to recruit 86

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
participants and also collected data for

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
around two months

158
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
so what we found

159
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,199
is perhaps not so surprising for the

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,560
most of you

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
most of the devices do not rely on the

162
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
direct on the more private direct

163
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,440
advertisements in fact just from these

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
indirect advertisements we will be able

165
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,639
to detect or observe more than 214

166
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
unique types of devices not just unique

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
devices unique types of devices

168
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,880
we also found that this scheme of

169
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,039
address randomization really is not

170
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,639
effective in practice

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,039
many advertisements contained revealing

172
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,199
names of the devices as you can see in

173
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
that left hand table over there for

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
example you're able to sniff a glucose

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
monitor

176
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
also devices use consistent addresses

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,720
over time as you can see in that middle

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,360
table for example while an hp i was able

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
to scan for around 40 days and for all

180
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
of these 40 days 37 days several fitbit

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,639
devices maintain the same addresses

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,400
some devices do actually attempt address

183
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,080
randomization as you can see at that

184
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
right hand table over there by flipping

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
three or four bits at each advertisement

186
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
session which is not very effective in

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,360
terms of randomization

188
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,599
we also found that device bearing and

189
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
bonding probably is not very imp it's

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
not implemented well in practice

191
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
we're able to connect to different

192
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
devices without an existing thrust

193
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,479
relationship

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,000
for example we're able to see the

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,759
battery values of different fitbit

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
devices as they change in runtime

197
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
and we're able to connect to other

198
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
devices like this digital pen over here

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
that has a value that was changing

200
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
frequently which which i'm not sure what

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,080
that is but could be revealing

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
so basically if you have an if stopper

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
who's scanning your

204
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,440
advertisements can track you over time

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
from these consistent addresses or from

206
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
poor randomization

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
they can profile you by studying for

208
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
example your health condition as we saw

209
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
from this

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
glucose monitor and in extreme cases you

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
can envision an attacker actually posing

212
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,479
threat to user or posing harm to user by

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,680
for example

214
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
fingerprinting a sensitive security

215
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,199
system from a distance and then

216
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,879
exploiting the vulnerabilities that

217
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
might exist in it

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
so our objective in this talk is to

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
effectively fend these threats to ble

220
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,639
device users

221
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,479
but very importantly we need to do that

222
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
in a device agnostic manner

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
meaning that we're not here proposing

224
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
any additional in ble privacy and

225
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
we're not proposing any additional

226
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
privacy enhancements to the ble protocol

227
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
because this will be very hard if not

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
impossible to deploy

229
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
this will require actually pushing a

230
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,400
firmware update for these thousands of

231
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
devices that are existing out there and

232
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,639
as we know from our operating systems

233
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
experience like from the case of android

234
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,799
for example one operating system

235
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
maintained by one company

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
a majority of these android devices

237
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
because of some ecosystem fragmentations

238
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,640
are out of date now think about these

239
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
millions of devices out there with

240
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,919
thousands of manufacturers and

241
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
developers that are really not

242
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
interested in developing firmware

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
updates

244
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,440
and then we have to rely on external

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
hardware to enact the security and

246
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
privacy protection so for usability and

247
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
deployability we would like to for this

248
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
hardware to be commercial of the shelf

249
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
and for obvious reasons would like to

250
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
have this system working with as little

251
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
user intervention as possible

252
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
and our answer as you might have guessed

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,000
as blea garden

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
so blea guardian is a system from a high

255
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
level standpoint has two main components

256
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
it has a hardware component which is

257
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
basically an external bluetooth radio

258
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
that you can attach to your gateway or

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
to your host such as your smartphone and

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
it will enact a privacy answer and will

261
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
act privacy and security for the set of

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
ble devices around you

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
our choice of implementation was

264
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,600
ubertooth1 an available open source

265
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
bluetooth development framework that

266
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
allows us to transmit and receive on any

267
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
ble channel

268
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
we also developed user level apps that

269
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,440
run on gateways and and for example like

270
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
an android app that allows the user to

271
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,080
configure vle guardian and to up and to

272
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
update the firmware of the overtooth

273
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
radio when needed

274
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
so when you first run ble guardian it

275
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,519
will scan for nearby devices as you can

276
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
see at that ui over there

277
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
the user can designate one or more

278
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
devices to be hidden

279
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
and that's the the task of the

280
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
device hiding module which will prevent

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
unauthorized entities from scanning or

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
observing said device

283
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
and then we have the access control

284
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,440
module which is which will only allow

285
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
authorized clients

286
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,560
to view and connect to said devices to

287
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
these target devices and in the meantime

288
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
we'll be scanning or be keeping an eye

289
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,279
on unauthorized connecting connection

290
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
requests to our devices and will alert

291
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,079
the user session case so at a high level

292
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,279
we have two main components we have

293
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,519
device hiding module which will hide the

294
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
device from everyone and you have the

295
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
access control module which would only

296
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
allow authorized clients to see that

297
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,519
device and connect with it i will start

298
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,680
describing the device hiding module

299
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
so to hide a device we need to prevent

300
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
others from

301
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
correctly decoding advertisements

302
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
because advertisements are the only mean

303
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,959
by which a device presence is not to

304
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,760
others so intuitively to hide that to

305
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
prevent others from decoding these

306
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,839
advertisements we're gonna jam them

307
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,000
but that's challenging for two reasons

308
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
because we need to jam precisely at the

309
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
same moment the device is advertising

310
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
because if we miss the advertisement

311
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
we're gonna release information about

312
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,399
the device but we can't keep just keep

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,000
jamming all the time because that's

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
harmful and

315
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,800
that's not something that you want to do

316
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
now recall that each device will

317
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
advertise that if pseudo-periodic

318
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
pattern right so there's the

319
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,399
advertisement sequence and it will sleep

320
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
for a random delay between zero and ten

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,079
milliseconds so you need to anticipate

322
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
that and the protocol defines the three

323
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
advertisement channels but it really

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,880
doesn't

325
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,640
identify the sequence it follows

326
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
advertising on these channels so it's

327
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,560
not necessarily that has to advertise at

328
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,519
37 38 39 so in the paper and i'm not

329
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,680
gonna delve in deeply into that

330
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,480
we have the protocol that we use using a

331
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
single raid you can learn the

332
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
advertising sequence of on these

333
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,720
channels

334
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
so blea guardian will go into a learning

335
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
phase to identify the advertisement

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,920
interval of the device it will observe

337
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,839
different advertisements of the device

338
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,120
and would monitor the entire

339
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,880
advertisement time

340
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
now the best estimator of your

341
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
advertisement interval is the average of

342
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,560
these advertisement and service that you

343
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
observed minus 5 millisecond which is

344
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
the average of this random delay

345
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
assuming that

346
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,240
its distribution is symmetric

347
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,040
so in the device last advertised at a

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
time instant tn nominally would expect

349
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
the next advertisement to happen in tn

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
plus advertisement interval and tn plus

351
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
advertisement interval plus 10

352
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,000
milliseconds but now we don't really

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
have access to this advertisement

354
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
interval we have an access to an

355
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
estimate of this advertisement interval

356
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
which we denote advertisement prime as

357
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
advertisement plus minus error

358
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
so

359
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
we expect the next advertisement to

360
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
happen between tn plus advertisement

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
prime minus error and tn plus

362
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
advertisement prime plus error plus 10

363
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
milliseconds

364
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,600
and we denote this time interval as the

365
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,519
monetary interval

366
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
so during this monitoring interval bla

367
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
guardian will be

368
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
aggressively sampling the channel rssi

369
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
to see if there's a transmission taking

370
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
place when it detects the transmission

371
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
is taking place it immediately moves and

372
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
starts jamming that and starts jamming

373
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,880
the channel and then follows the

374
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
advertisement sequence of the device to

375
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,399
effectively hide it

376
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,200
now

377
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,040
there are more involved case of having

378
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
more than one transmission happening at

379
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,480
the same marching interval i'm not going

380
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,839
to go into that you can also see the

381
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,360
details in the paper but that's

382
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,959
something that the ali guardian handles

383
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,199
as well

384
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,639
so at this point

385
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,959
blue guardian has hidden the device so

386
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
nobody can actually access it and if

387
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,160
nobody can actually see the

388
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
advertisements nobody can issue

389
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
connection requests so how to how do we

390
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,519
enable connection requests from

391
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,959
authorized clients

392
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,639
and that's the task

393
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
of the access control module so we have

394
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,120
to make

395
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
it has two main subtasks if you want to

396
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
say it has an authorization sub module

397
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
that allows us to authorize clients to

398
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
to access this ble device and you rely

399
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
on bluetooth classic as an out of band

400
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,800
channel to enable this authorization

401
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,720
process because most of these clients

402
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
and the host bla guardian is attached to

403
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
are smartphones or gateways and their

404
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,199
bluetooth ships are dual mode meaning

405
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,920
they have ble and bluetooth classic

406
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
and so blue guardian runs as a service

407
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
on this bluetooth classic with a

408
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
non-uuid and bluetooth address

409
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,720
and these are made public

410
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
so when a client that wishes to

411
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,399
authorize yourself will issue an attempt

412
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
connection to the le guardian service

413
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
which will prompt a pairing request and

414
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
the user has a choice either to approve

415
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
or deny this request and if the user

416
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,639
approves such a request then the client

417
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,959
will be authorized by the user to access

418
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,560
her ble device

419
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,800
now how actually does this access take

420
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
place is the job of the connection

421
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
enabling submodule

422
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,519
so

423
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,160
every connection request will contains a

424
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,399
set of connection parameters that

425
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,000
indicate how the connection should take

426
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
place and the protocol defines a three

427
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
million different combinations of these

428
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
connection parameters

429
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,440
now blue guardian will choose a

430
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
particular set of these parameters and

431
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,800
will communicate them over the

432
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,880
out-of-band channel to the to the client

433
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,120
for reasons that will be evident in a

434
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
little bit

435
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
then immediately after the device

436
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,160
finishes advertising on the last channel

437
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
it vla guardian will stop jamming

438
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
and it will advertise on behalf of the

439
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
device using the same address but it

440
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
will reduce the amount of formation

441
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,199
leakage so what happened now is the

442
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
following the client is scanning for an

443
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
advertisement and it received one that

444
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
looks just like from the target ble

445
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
device at the same time the target ble

446
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,079
device is listening for connection

447
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,199
requests

448
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
and this way the connection the ble

449
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,360
connection process is not broken it's

450
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
still the same we haven't changed

451
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
anything of how this ble protocol works

452
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,040
and the client can just issue a

453
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,959
connection request using these

454
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,199
particular connection parameters that we

455
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,240
we provided earlier and this and this is

456
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,839
how we distinguish this authorized

457
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,680
connection request from unauthorized

458
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
access requests because the probability

459
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
of the attacker guessing these

460
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,839
connection parameters is very low and it

461
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,000
will not be able to mimic a connection

462
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
request so if we observe a connection

463
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,279
request that does not contain such

464
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,040
parameters we immediately move and jump

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
and as this point will have a legitimate

466
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,959
connection taking place

467
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
now the protocol doesn't specify that

468
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,880
advertising the device has to stop

469
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,959
advertising after it connects it can

470
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,720
still advertise but with non-connectable

471
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
advertisements

472
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
ble guardian still jams these

473
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,920
advertisements and data exchange can

474
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,440
take place according to the channel

475
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
hopping sequence that has been

476
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,720
pre-negotiated

477
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
so to evaluate ble garden we focus on

478
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
three main aspects the distance over

479
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,600
which and it acts the privacy protection

480
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,839
the impact on the advertisement channel

481
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
and the energy overhead when connected

482
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
to a smartphone

483
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,199
so we're going to start with the cutoff

484
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,480
distance

485
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
now blue guardian is limited in terms of

486
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
transmission power that we can use

487
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
really guardian basically will because

488
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
we're using because of fcc regulations

489
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
basically where you it can transmit

490
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,079
using the same power as a bluetooth

491
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,079
class one device

492
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
so the further ble guardian is from the

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
actual target device there will be an

494
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
area around it over which the attacker

495
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
can still receive these advertisements

496
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
and possibly issue connection requests

497
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
so to evaluate how and we call this the

498
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,559
cutoff distance so to evaluate how this

499
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
cut-off distance changes as function of

500
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
the distance between the ali guardian

501
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
and the target vle device we performed

502
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,520
two experiments by which we fixed the

503
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
position of a ble guardian of a ble

504
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,919
target device advertising at the

505
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
possible highest possible frequency and

506
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
you moved b and e guardian okay 10

507
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
centimeters at the part we also had the

508
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
two scenarios where ble guardian was

509
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
covered by a backpack and exposed

510
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
and relied on a ti sniffer that allows

511
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,440
us to sniff bialy advertisements that

512
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
failed the crc check to see if we are

513
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
receiving if it's receiving

514
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
advertisements or not and we also relied

515
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
on the galaxy s5 to see to mark its

516
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
cutoff distance as you can see the

517
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
cutoff distance is smaller as the

518
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
distance between ble guardian and the

519
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
target ble device is smaller

520
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,679
and the take away message here is that

521
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
even when blue garden is is three meters

522
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
far from the target ble device the

523
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,039
adversary has to be within one meter to

524
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
be able to issue any connection request

525
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
so it has to be

526
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,960
proxy very close to the user

527
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
we then evaluated the impact of the

528
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
advertisement channel for this scenario

529
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,360
we had a broadcom ble chip advertising

530
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,799
at three different advertisement

531
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,760
intervals we also had two innocuous ble

532
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,679
devices advertising at the highest

533
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
possible frequency which is corresponds

534
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
to 20 milliseconds advertisement

535
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,000
interval and you had 15 background ble

536
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
devices advertising at different

537
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,440
advertisement intervals

538
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,919
and these show the box these box plots

539
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
box plots show the distribution of

540
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
unnecessary gems each monitoring

541
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
interval that i described before so the

542
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
higher divorce meaning that we're

543
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,679
advertising we we're issuing jams where

544
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
we should not be doing that

545
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
when the device is advertising at the

546
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
highest possible frequency the

547
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,440
probability of having other devices

548
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,120
advertising within its monitoring

549
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
interval is higher so possibly you might

550
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,760
have to jam more but as you can see all

551
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
of the medians are around zero so in 50

552
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,400
percent in 50 percent of the cases we

553
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
don't issue any in

554
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
accidental jam with the not with the

555
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,919
maximum number of accidental gem being

556
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,640
two or three as we use higher

557
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,559
advertisement rates that probability of

558
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
collisions will be smaller less devices

559
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,400
are will be advertising during these

560
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,559
monitoring intervals and we're gonna be

561
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,919
issuing less and less accidental gems

562
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,080
now in the paper you also have the

563
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
impact of the of the ali guardian on

564
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
particular inaugural ple devices we're

565
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,200
not going to show it here

566
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,360
and finally we evaluated the energy

567
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,679
overhead of blue guardium is attached to

568
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,640
a smartphone with galaxy s5 in this case

569
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
samsung galaxy s5 in this case it's

570
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
worth noting first that really guardian

571
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
has no energy overhead whatsoever on

572
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,120
target ble devices or authorized clients

573
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,320
because basically we're not touching

574
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
them we're not doing anything with them

575
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,600
but when it's attached to your

576
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
smartphone so there's some some power

577
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
cost you have to pay to power it

578
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,559
but we also measure the additional

579
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,799
overhead when it's protecting up to 10

580
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,200
devices and we found that overhead to be

581
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,679
at most 16 percent when we're as i said

582
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,320
protecting 10 advertised 10 ble devices

583
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
at the same time advertising at

584
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
different advertising frequencies

585
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
and the reason for this low overhead

586
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
that the ali garden doesn't

587
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
is not in receive and transmission mode

588
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,799
all the time it only receives for this

589
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,880
monitoring interval and

590
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
jams when it actually senses an

591
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
advertisement on that channel

592
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,320
so in conclusion i described the ali

593
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
guardian which is a system that we

594
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,760
designed to enact privacy protection for

595
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,799
ble device users it is device agnostic

596
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,320
and relies only on commercial of the

597
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
shelf hardware as you saw it has low

598
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
overhead low energy overhead and low

599
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
overhead on the advertisement channels

600
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
as part of our future work we're

601
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,520
exploring to extend to other short-range

602
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
communication protocols like zigbee

603
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
which has which features some similar

604
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
beacon based communication and we're

605
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
considering or actually investigating

606
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
whether we can implement the ali

607
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
guardian over bluetooth chips that might

608
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,960
have open source firmware as to not use

609
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,280
an external hardware anymore

610
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,918
and thank you

611
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,840
hey thanks for your talk can you just go

612
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,200
back two slides two slides yeah one more

613
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,000
there

614
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
is

615
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
that number looks really high to me the

616
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,320
idle power

617
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
yes

618
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,039
that's over a watt idle power yes it's

619
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,280
cars it's very similar to when you're

620
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,679
powering um a wi-fi chip on your device

621
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,559
so

622
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,039
it is a bit high so the idle power is is

623
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
a bit high yeah so it corresponds right

624
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,760
so when you're running your smartphone

625
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
and you have like wi-fi turned on the

626
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
power will be somehow like right but

627
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
that is the idle power when the radio is

628
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
on or when the radio is off no this

629
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,760
either power and the radio is on on okay

630
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,440
it makes more sense okay thanks

631
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
all right let me remind the audience

632
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,640
that this session is your last chance to

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,159
ask questions so

634
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,679
don't be shy

635
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,720
and as you're thinking about one

636
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
custom could you talk about potential

637
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
limitations and challenges of deploying

638
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
your technology

639
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
in real commercial devices

640
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,039
your real commercial devices i mean or

641
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,600
you mean real environments because

642
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,840
right real real

643
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
environments so the major limitations

644
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,039
that we need

645
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
currently for the current implementation

646
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,600
current

647
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
prototype that you need external

648
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
hardware which means for example if

649
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,919
you're wearing your fitbits and your

650
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,520
runnings you need this overtooth to be

651
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,919
connected to your phone as you run so

652
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,640
there's the energy problem first

653
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
the other problem is that

654
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,919
this this power limitation so as you saw

655
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,840
like three meters we already lost a

656
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
meter now think about your home

657
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,039
environment and you want to attach this

658
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,559
to your say

659
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
raspberry pi's or your access point if

660
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,440
it is vle equipped so you might have to

661
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
study how you can deploy multiple of

662
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
these as to enact effective privacy

663
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
protection so it's not really

664
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,919
straightforward at this time to deploy

665
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,080
in real environments but i mean we're

666
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,400
going to move towards this direction

667
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,430
let's stand question again

668
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,809
[Applause]

669
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,639
you
