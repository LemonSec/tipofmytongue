1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,719
thank you for the introduction

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
and as you already said i will be

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,119
talking about the temporal linkability

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,600
of micron a expression profiles and i'll

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
start with with a quick primer on micron

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,720
a micron ace and micron expression

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
so actually micron a's

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
are part of the research field of

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
epigenetics

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,079
and

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,800
micronase are small non-coding rna

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
molecules which regulate most of the

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
human genes and that means that they

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,239
regulate basically what the cell does

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
and also what type of cell it is

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,760
and micron a expression this is just

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,520
real valued number for each of these

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,079
micronase which quantifies how much of

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,960
these micronase are active in a given

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
cell or tissue

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,520
and let's have a look at the most

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
interesting properties of micrornas

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,680
so micronase are highly influenced by

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
external factors such as aging diet

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,240
environmental chemicals

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
or also childhood development

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
and as these external factors change

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
over time also the micron expression

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
changes over time

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,320
also micron expression reflects the

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
health status of a person

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
they influence highly how a cell works

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
and what kind of cell it is

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,479
and as such it is unsurprising that

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
biomedical researchers found

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
associations between micron expression

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,960
and various severe diseases such as

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
cancers or heart disease alzheimer's

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
disease and so on

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,079
so let's have a look at a comparison

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
between dna and micronase

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,720
so while dna

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
contains mostly the blueprint of the

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
body every cell in the human body con

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
contains the same dna

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,159
and so it just tells the cell what it

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,680
potentially can do

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
the micronase

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
they

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,399
tell the cell what it really does and

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
they regulate the gene expression or in

52
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,000
a computer analogy it would be like dna

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
is the hardware of the body where is the

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
micronase are the software of the body

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,920
and while dna is fixed over time except

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
for rare mutations the micronase as they

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
are influenced by these external factors

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,599
they change quite a lot

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,120
and dna can predict the risk of getting

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
certain diseases sometimes

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,920
but micron a actually it reflects the

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
health status and can tell whether you

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
carry a specific disease at a given

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,599
point in time

65
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,720
finally

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
the last difference between those is

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
that dna actually has been researched a

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,480
lot so far as you can for example see in

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,160
this survey from 2014.

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
so it is quite remarkable that micronase

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
have we have been largely overlooked so

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
far despite being so

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,959
so influential on our health status

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
and when we started our research on

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
micron a expressions and also the

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,360
linkability we asked biomedical

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,519
researchers what they think about

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
potential privacy threats

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
and they said

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,920
actually this temporal variability of

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
these microneed expressions shields them

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
from any privacy threat and that was one

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
of the motivations why we also started

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
with this

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
line of work

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,000
so

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,480
this is the end of the primer and

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
we can go to the actual research

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
questions i will answer in this talk

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
of course

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,519
this research is based on

92
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,120
micronexpression based data

93
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
as it is used in a lot of studies

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,879
nowadays and also in hospitals so it's

95
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
also increasingly used in the medical

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
practice

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
and the first question we're going to

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,879
tackle is

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,560
that the microneed expressions are

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
actually linkable over time so if they

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
are vulnerable to linkability attacks

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
we're going to look at two different

103
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,239
attacks

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
i will go into the details later on

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,599
so and if

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
we find out that these are vulnerable to

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
these kind of linkability attacks can we

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
protect this kind of data

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
of course if we protect the data we also

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,519
have to be careful

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,240
that if you protect the data still

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
this data is somehow useful for

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,520
researchers also for making a diagnosis

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
so these will be the three main research

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
questions i'm going to answer

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
but

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
let's first of all look at how an

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
adversary could get this kind of data in

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
the first place

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
so typically a person goes to the

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,000
hospital they take a blood or cell

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,240
sample or tissue sample of that person

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
and they measure these micron expression

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
profiles

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
then depending on whether it's done for

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,240
research or just to make a diagnosis the

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
data could be for example

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
be uploaded online into a public

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
research database which everyone can

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,199
access

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
of course they strip off the names of

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,199
the patients but still everyone can for

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
example on this gene expression omnibus

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
download micron a expression profiles of

135
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
real persons

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
moreover this kind of data is also

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
increasingly available on the black

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,479
market

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,080
for example between 2014 and 2015

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
cyber attacks against healthcare

141
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
companies have increased by more than 72

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
percent and since

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
2015

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,919
already more than 400 breaches

145
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,400
of medical data have been reported only

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
in the us the largest of them may be the

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,240
one of anthem where almost 80 million

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,600
records of patients have been leaked

149
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
so let's have a look what the adversity

150
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
then can do with this kind of data

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
the first

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
attack we're going to study in this work

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,240
is

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
a very targeted one called

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
identification attack

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
where we have the sample of one person

157
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
and we want to

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,360
find this person for example in a public

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
research database

160
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
and of course the samples can be from

161
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
different points in time

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
and also it could be that the sample we

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,759
have

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
is from the person where the person was

165
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
healthy and we want to find out whether

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
now

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
it has a certain disease

168
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
um by just looking at

169
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
whether whether we can find that person

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,199
again in the public research database

171
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,400
and the second kind of attack we're

172
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
looking at is more broad and so we have

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
actually two databases and we want to

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
find the corresponding samples so which

175
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,479
sample from left hand side corresponds

176
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,919
to which sample from the right hand side

177
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,880
so let's say

178
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,199
and we carry out these two attacks on

179
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,800
two different data sets

180
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
the first one consisting of 29

181
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,039
participants

182
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,800
healthy athletes

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,599
and

184
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,400
the

185
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,319
samples have been taken before and after

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
exercising and the time period in

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,639
between is exactly one week

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
and we measured more than 1 000 of these

189
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
different micron a's

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,960
from blood and plasma based samples of

191
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
these athletes

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
the second data set

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
we used

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,520
contains 26 participants all of them

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
lung cancer patients

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
and there we have much more points in

197
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
time to be except eight

198
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
and the

199
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
time period in between of the

200
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
consecutive ones is always three months

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
but you so we measure measured again the

202
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,280
same number of micronase but only on

203
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
plasma based samples

204
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
if you now would say okay this kind of

205
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
dataset seems to be small

206
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
actually it's quite huge for these kinds

207
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
of longitudinal studies

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
you have to know that one sample

209
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,560
for example one plasma based sample of

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,319
one person at one point in time already

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
costs several hundred dollars

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
and also

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
every of these 26 participants has to go

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
to the hospital every three months and

215
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
kind of just skip

216
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,039
one appointment because of birthday

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,120
party or something like that

218
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
so this is actually one of the largest

219
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
datas that's available out there

220
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
and since we have this huge number of

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
micronase measured

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
we first process preprocess this data

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,400
to get a smaller number of dimensions

224
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
and one reason for that is because some

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
of these micronase are possibly

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,840
correlated and the other reason is

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,240
because some of these micronase are just

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,159
uninteresting for linking them over time

229
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
and what we do is we apply a principal

230
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
component analysis with whitening

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,679
which first of all provides us with unit

232
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
variance

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
also it condenses the data into smaller

234
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,160
dimensional t m and we have to choose

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
this m

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
and also the components of the resulting

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
vector are then

238
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,360
uncorrelated

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,640
on the right top corner you see this

240
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,880
rktj and this is just the notation for

241
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
such a vector of all the micron a

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,240
expression values

243
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
of the individual k at time point t j

244
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
and then this principle component

245
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,800
analysis

246
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,560
out of this vector produces another

247
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
vector where all the components so there

248
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
we have only m components and all the

249
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
components are linear combinations of

250
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
the old vector

251
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
and one main advantage of

252
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
pca is that it tries to condense the

253
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,880
data into these smaller dimensionality

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,760
with minimal information loss

255
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
okay let's have a look at the first

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
attack this targeted one

257
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
called identification attack there we

258
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
have on the left hand side so in this

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
illustration on the right hand side but

260
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
the left hand side

261
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,120
blue

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
dot

263
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,600
the sample of the one target victim

264
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,760
we want to find in the database on the

265
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,519
right-hand side

266
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,920
and we use the pre-processed data so

267
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
these vectors of

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,519
the we get out of the pca and we measure

269
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,600
the euclidean distance between

270
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
this victim and each entry in the

271
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
database

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
and we choose that one as corresponding

273
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
that minimizes the euclidean distance

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
so let's have a look at the results we

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
get out of that

276
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
this graph on the left-hand side shows

277
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
on the x-axis the number of pca

278
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,600
dimensions we choose so this m

279
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,480
and

280
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
on the y-axis it shows the success rate

281
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,519
and that is the percentage of

282
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
successfully identified individuals

283
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
and the blue bars so it's measured on

284
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
the first status of the blue bars uh is

285
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
the success rate based on the plasma

286
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,480
based samples and the

287
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
potentially red bars but they look a bit

288
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,680
weird here um

289
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,120
they are

290
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,959
the success rate on the blood-based

291
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,240
samples

292
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
we can see that we can achieve success

293
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
rate of up to 76 percent on the

294
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
blood-based samples and the success rate

295
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
for the plasma based samples is

296
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,680
lower it's around

297
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,640
30 percent maybe

298
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
but still for the blood-based samples

299
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,640
they are able to achieve quite a high

300
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
success rate here

301
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
and now we compare these plasma based

302
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,760
samples the blue bars

303
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
with the plasma based samples from a

304
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,720
second data set

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
remember that we have eight time points

306
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,480
which means that we can measure the

307
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,079
success rate between all of them for

308
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
example between the first and the second

309
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
and also the first and the third and so

310
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
on and so we can get actually a lot of

311
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,399
different success rates and then this

312
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,640
graph we show the minimum and the

313
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,920
average of all these of these

314
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
combinations and all the maximum

315
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
and there we can see that the highest

316
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,160
average success rate we can achieve

317
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
between these combinations is around 22

318
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
percent where there are also some

319
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
combinations of time points where we can

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
get a success rate of up to 42

321
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
and if you consider that the

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,839
time period between the sample series

323
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,360
at least three months

324
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
it's still quite reasonable what we get

325
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
there and also comparable to what we had

326
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
on the other data set using the plasma

327
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,839
based samples

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
and if we compare them side by side we

329
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
can find some other interesting

330
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
observations for example

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
the highest success success rates in

332
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,279
both data sets occur at a similar number

333
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
of pca dimensions

334
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
and also if you look at the principal

335
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
components we get our

336
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
get out of the pca

337
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
we see a huge overlap between the

338
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
micronase there

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
and that basically means that an

340
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,519
adversary could first

341
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
quite easily guess a good number of pca

342
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,639
dimensions and also knows that the same

343
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
micronase probably

344
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,880
lead to a good high success rate for him

345
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,480
okay let's move on to the second attack

346
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
the matching attack

347
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
so here we have two databases by the way

348
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
they don't have to be equal in size but

349
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
for simplicity in this talk i will

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
assume exactly that if you want to know

351
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,399
more about the other case i refer to the

352
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,000
paper

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
and in the illustration on the right

354
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,200
hand side

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,079
i denoted both databases so

356
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,720
as so each database

357
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
is a set of nodes here for example the

358
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
blue nodes are the is the database from

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
time point t1 and the green nodes is the

360
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,120
other database

361
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,160
and then we want of course to minimize

362
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,079
the we want to find an assignment that

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,079
minimizes the sum of the euclidean

364
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,440
distances

365
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
written as a formula that looks like

366
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,639
this

367
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,839
and if we represent this as a graph

368
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
as shown on the right hand side as a

369
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
bypassed graph we can apply a graph

370
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
algorithm that runs in n to the power of

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,800
three

372
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
and we get out as an assignment that

373
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,279
could look like that

374
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,079
so

375
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,320
we get an assignment that minimizes the

376
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,600
sum of the euclidean distances

377
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,920
let's have a look at the results we get

378
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,720
out of this matching attack

379
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
so the structure of the diagrams is the

380
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,959
same as before but now it's the

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,320
different attack

382
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,199
and

383
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,399
here

384
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,959
remarkably we are able to achieve for

385
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,040
the blood based samples and success rate

386
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
up to 90 percent

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,600
again the plasma based samples perform a

388
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,560
bit worse but still

389
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
almost 50 percent there

390
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,079
if you compare that with the other data

391
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
set again it's quite comparable with 30

392
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,839
percent

393
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
uh on average

394
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,800
as the highest success rate there and

395
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,399
there are also some combinations of time

396
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
points where we get more than 50

397
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
actually

398
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
55 of success rate

399
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,959
i can also hear the number of pca

400
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,120
dimensions between both data sets where

401
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
you get high success rates is quite

402
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,160
similar

403
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,639
and also there's an overlap between the

404
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,040
principal components

405
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
so the main takeaway of this slide

406
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,399
probably is that

407
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
we get on these blood-based samples a

408
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,839
success rate up to 90

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
and using these data sets we also

410
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
post other questions

411
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
for example

412
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
we tried to extrapolate the results for

413
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,000
larger data sets so to see how it

414
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
evolves if we would have larger

415
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,440
databases

416
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
available

417
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
and in this graph on the right hand side

418
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
you see on the x-axis the size of the

419
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
data set that we are officially vary

420
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
and the blue line again

421
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
are the plasma based samples on the

422
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,120
first data set and red line are the

423
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
blood-based samples and we see that

424
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,920
the success decreases quite sharply for

425
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,800
the blood

426
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
plasma based samples but for the

427
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,120
blood-based samples it's almost linearly

428
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
and if you explain that to for example

429
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,399
120 participants we see that for the

430
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,680
blood-based samples we still have

431
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,519
success rate of up to 60 percent

432
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,320
another question we looked at was

433
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,199
um how does the success rate evolve

434
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,800
with the time period in between the

435
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
samples so if the time period between

436
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
the samples is three months or six

437
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,639
months and so on

438
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,160
and so this

439
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
is measured on the second data set and

440
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
there we see again minimum average and

441
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
maximum success rate for increasing time

442
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,079
periods

443
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,959
and

444
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,279
the red line in the middle the average

445
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,800
shows that

446
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,720
it almost stays constant within the

447
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
first year and even within the first 15

448
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
months

449
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,440
and if we now take all of these results

450
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
together and look again at this

451
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
common belief of

452
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
a lot of biomedical researchers that

453
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
there are no privacy threats

454
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
i think that we clearly have shown that

455
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,880
there are privacy threats and this

456
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,240
belief is just

457
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,399
unjustified

458
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
this was then the motivation for us to

459
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,720
go further and try to

460
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,079
try to protect this kind of data

461
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
and for that

462
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
we investigated two different counter

463
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,800
measures i represent now the first one

464
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
probabilistically sanitizing micronic

465
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
expression profiles

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
and that means we add noise to the data

467
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
in a probabilistic in a

468
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
probabilistically and fully distributed

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
and also differentially private manner

470
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,919
providing what we call ep genome

471
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,079
indistinguishability

472
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,559
and to do that we draw noise from a

473
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
multivariate laplacian mechanism

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
and then if we added this noise to the

475
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,559
data the data could potentially be

476
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,120
published online for for example in this

477
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
research databases

478
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
but sometimes randomization or

479
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
perturbing the data is simply not an

480
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
option for example if you

481
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
want to have a diagnosis in the hospital

482
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
the doctors will simply refuse to add

483
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,919
noise to the data because that could of

484
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,160
course somehow influence

485
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
the diagnosis and that is not something

486
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,039
you want and therefore we also

487
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,679
investigated the second countermeasure

488
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,760
of hiding non-relevant micron

489
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
expressions and non-relevant means

490
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
nonviolent for example for the diagnosis

491
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,160
because only some of the micronase are

492
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
associated with the disease

493
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,799
and

494
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,480
also this countermeasure has one

495
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,679
downside

496
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,559
i will

497
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
go into detail of that

498
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
in a second

499
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
there are correlations between micronase

500
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
and that means

501
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,919
even if you publish only a subset you

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,720
could

503
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
use the correlations to infer

504
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,240
information about the hidden ones

505
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
and as i hinted at in the research

506
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
questions we are not only trying to

507
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
prevent the linkability of the samples

508
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
but we also have to look at the utility

509
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
of the data so we want to preserve the

510
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,200
accuracy of a

511
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,679
of classification

512
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
diagnosis as diseased or healthy and

513
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
usually the biomedical researchers in

514
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,280
the field use a radial svm classifier as

515
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,919
shown in the illustration below so this

516
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
red circle indicates the diseased

517
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
persons and we have two of them in the

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,919
circle and the other are lying around

519
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,919
and then if we add noise to the data of

520
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,360
course

521
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
the points could move

522
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
and suddenly one person that was

523
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,039
actually healthy is classified as

524
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,919
diseased and one person that is actually

525
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,960
diseased is now classified as healthy

526
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
and we want to prevent that and

527
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
therefore we measure also the accuracy

528
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
of such a classification

529
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,440
on another data set

530
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
this other data set has a lot of

531
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
participants more than one thousand but

532
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,760
only one point in time and one each of

533
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
these participants

534
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,120
has one of 19 different diseases

535
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,000
okay

536
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
let's have a look at the results

537
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
the results i will present in a second

538
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,520
look similar to that so here we have a

539
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,440
disease for example multiple sclerosis

540
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
and a blue line indicating the accuracy

541
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,679
of such a classification

542
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,080
and the 99.2 percent

543
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,600
are the maximum achievable accuracy here

544
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
for a subset of

545
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
40 microns for example

546
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,919
then we also have a red line that

547
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
indicates the success rate

548
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,679
all right and on the x-axis we vary of

549
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,679
course the number of published microneed

550
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,880
expressions

551
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,760
and

552
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,919
for the success rate is in the worst

553
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
case scenario and that is

554
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
we use the matching attack

555
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,559
and we assume that the adversary knows

556
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
the best number of piece a dimensions to

557
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,520
use for this attack

558
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
and then if you have both of these lines

559
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,679
we try to find a good trade-off between

560
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,039
the accuracy

561
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,840
and the privacy or the

562
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
success of the attack

563
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
and for example for multiple sclerosis

564
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
here

565
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,080
we think that this could be a good

566
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
trade-off

567
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
so at seven micron a's the success

568
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,400
decreases relatively to the 90 percent

569
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
that are maximum

570
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
possible

571
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,400
by 54

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
and the accuracy in this example

573
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
decreases by only one percent

574
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,440
let's have a look at another disease

575
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,039
glioma

576
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
the accuracy the baseline accuracies of

577
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,720
these

578
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,559
92.7 percent here

579
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,360
it should be a point um

580
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,960
it's actually below what we had for

581
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
multiple sclerosis but that's just

582
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
disease related

583
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
and

584
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
here we can find a trait of

585
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
at this position for example

586
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,480
so

587
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,039
we only publish four micronase but we

588
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,240
get a success decrease by 80 percent and

589
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,200
again

590
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,039
as for the case of multiple sclerosis

591
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,640
the accuracy decreases by only one

592
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
percent

593
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,000
and

594
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
now i'll add to this graph also what

595
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,120
happens if we assume that the adversary

596
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
can infer correlations perfectly so we

597
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
have now another

598
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
line in there

599
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
and there we assume for example if one

600
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,280
micronase published in the line below

601
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,039
that now the adversary

602
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,360
in knows perfectly all the correlated

603
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
micronase and there we see that

604
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,440
the success can have a gap between these

605
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,360
of more than 20 percent

606
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,559
and so

607
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
one has really be has to be careful when

608
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,400
hiding

609
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,840
micronase

610
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
that

611
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
one also

612
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,799
takes into account possible correlations

613
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
and further further research into this

614
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,400
area of these correlations between

615
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,280
micronases needed

616
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,480
let's move on to the other counter

617
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,440
measure the probabilistic

618
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
standardization

619
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
again the structure of the graph is

620
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,360
similar to before but now on the x-axis

621
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
we have the amount of noise which is

622
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
determined by the privacy parameter

623
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
epsilon

624
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,679
and this is again multiple multiple

625
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
sclerosis as we had before and

626
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,039
here we think that this could be a good

627
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,360
trade-off and if we compare that side by

628
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,679
side with the hiding mechanism we see

629
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,520
that

630
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
the red line which is the success rate

631
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
and is inversely proportional to the

632
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,919
privacy

633
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,880
is here lower than on the left-hand side

634
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
for the hiding and that actually means

635
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,120
that the privacy

636
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
with the noising on the right hand side

637
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,120
is better

638
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000
and if we compare it in numbers we see

639
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,720
that

640
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
in this trade-off the success now

641
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
decreases by 63 whereas for the hiding

642
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,120
it decreased by 54 percent and the

643
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,720
accuracy decreases here by

644
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,360
0.65

645
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,199
whereas for the hiding it decreased by 1

646
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,679
and we can get even better for other

647
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,480
diseases so for example here stomach

648
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
tumor

649
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,559
we can find a good trade-off at this

650
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
position where the success decreases by

651
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
70

652
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,159
while the accuracy decreases by only 0.2

653
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,760
percent

654
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,320
and if we now take these results they

655
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
can look

656
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,960
at our research questions

657
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,000
i think that we successfully answered

658
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the first research question so are

659
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
microneed expression profiles vulnerable

660
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,440
to likability attacks

661
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
as yes they are

662
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,320
up to 90 success rate

663
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,080
for blood-based samples should convince

664
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,840
everyone who thinks that they are not

665
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,039
linkable okay if yes and it was yes how

666
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,919
can we protect this kind of data

667
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
noising would be for example one option

668
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,559
but as i said sometimes it's not an

669
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
option and there we propose the hiding

670
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,840
and using the noison we can

671
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,799
often

672
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,679
reduce the success of the attacks

673
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,080
to almost random guessing

674
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
and finally

675
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,200
can the candy protection mechanism

676
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
somehow preserves the utility of the

677
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,279
data is it still useful for diagnosis or

678
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,799
for research

679
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,760
and

680
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,559
there we saw in our evaluations at least

681
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,480
on our data sets that noising in general

682
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
provides a better privacy utility

683
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
trade-off

684
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,120
in our dataset for 17 out of 19 diseases

685
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,159
and most often for most of the diseases

686
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,559
the privacy could be doubled

687
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
whereas the utility decreased by less

688
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,520
than one percent

689
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,159
so i thank you for listening to my talk

690
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,279
and i hope

691
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,799
that you have some interesting

692
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,280
[Applause]

693
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,720
all questions

694
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
we have time for a few questions

695
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,520
hi i was wondering whether you guys have

696
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,279
stefan sorry for microsoft research

697
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,360
great talk interesting i i do not know a

698
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,840
lot about this area my guess is some of

699
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,159
many of us don't

700
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
i was wondering whether you've tried to

701
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
look at the

702
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,000
economic cost of these things to try to

703
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
do like some sort of you know cost

704
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,960
analysis as to when you lose so for

705
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
example your statement here on this

706
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
slide in the appearance on several sides

707
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
utility cost is less than one percent

708
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
can i put a dollar amount to that what

709
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,320
does that mean

710
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,559
yeah so utility we measured the utility

711
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,159
as

712
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
the so the question is clearly you know

713
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,039
losing privacy uh there is a cost to

714
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,120
that and one way to measure cost is to

715
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
dollars i'm not saying it's the best way

716
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,559
i'm not saying that's the only way

717
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,360
that's one way people do it in practice

718
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,919
and and so so you lose privacy on the

719
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
other hand doing this kind of medical

720
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,840
analysis we gain something right there

721
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,760
are some diagnostics you talked about so

722
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
that's again you can look at that in

723
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
terms of in terms of dollars so i was

724
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,480
wondering whether you could do some sort

725
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
of economics analysis where you can sort

726
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
of trade off these dollars and see what

727
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,679
the right balance is

728
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,279
this seems like a very interesting

729
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,159
approach we did not do this

730
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,240
i think it's quite hard to do it because

731
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
how would you

732
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
somehow

733
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,039
measure the

734
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,919
the cost and dollar for privacy because

735
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,039
you don't know of real attacks maybe and

736
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,600
you don't know how the attacker

737
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,320
in the end uses the data so it's hard to

738
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,799
measure that

739
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,480
by talking to people who think about

740
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,799
these things like yeah okay thanks think

741
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
hi jonathan walsh lockheed martin this

742
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,960
is very interesting i wonder it seems to

743
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
me that this could be applicable to a

744
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,760
lot of different categories of this type

745
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,360
of data i wonder if you could comment on

746
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,840
if there are other types of medical data

747
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,159
like this that your approach could help

748
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,919
make these types of determinations and

749
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,360
assist in increasing privacy in those

750
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,039
areas

751
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
so yes i also think that it's applicable

752
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
to other kinds of data

753
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,960
we did not look into other kinds of data

754
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,840
yet

755
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
but we're planning to also

756
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,799
apply this to other kinds of epigenetic

757
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,279
data and other medical data in general

758
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,600
yes

759
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,679
pascal in your counter measures

760
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,360
you use the

761
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,520
accuracy of your matching attack

762
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
as a metric for privacy

763
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,799
uh can you make a case for why this

764
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,200
particular matching attack is an optimal

765
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,399
attack for an adversary who is aware of

766
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,799
your defense mechanism

767
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,799
so i wouldn't say that it's an optimal

768
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,840
attack

769
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,679
i would think that

770
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,360
you could

771
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
potentially improve this attack so it's

772
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,279
rather a lower bound

773
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,120
for an adversary

774
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
and

775
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,039
actually i'm pretty sure that you can

776
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,600
still improve the attack

777
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,120
all right very very exciting and

778
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
disciplinary work

779
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
well this brings us to an end of the

780
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,960
privacy session as well as and for this

781
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
conference let's thank all the first

782
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,039
speakers once again
