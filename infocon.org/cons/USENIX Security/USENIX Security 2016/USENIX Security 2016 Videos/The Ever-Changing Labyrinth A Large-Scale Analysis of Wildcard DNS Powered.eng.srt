1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,000
and

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,040
dr

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,519
professor

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,359
kohanchang from

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,119
chinese university of hong kong

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
search engine optimization or seo

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,119
technologies are used to improve the

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,479
visibility of a web page or some

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,280
keywords in search engines

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,559
what had seo technologies are encouraged

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,320
by search engines

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
like to provide some

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,600
site map file or put some

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
descriptive keywords in title or

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,600
metadata of a webpage

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
however

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,840
blackhead seo tried to

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
manipulate the city indians to gain

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,440
higher or

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,559
quicker

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,438
visibility in search result

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,720
such as

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
include

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
many killers or killer staffing

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
link farming

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
forums spamming or search engine

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
cloaking and etcetera

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,520
traditional blackhead seo techniques

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,400
are

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
seriously punished by search engines

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
uh in this work we started a

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
new kind of blackhead seo service

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,280
surviv spider pro

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,159
although most of the services we found

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
right now are in chinese

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,479
but they

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,680
impact all popular search engines

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
include

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,320
google and bing

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,158
not only limited to china

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
how does this work

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
despite 4 can avoid punishment from

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
search engines by the falling

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,720
first

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
it can bypass loop detection with

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
countless websites powered by

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
wildcard dns

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
second

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,280
it can defeat the search engines

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,480
plagiarism detection

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
by ever changing content

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
or

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
which is generated dynamically

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
third

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
free writing it can abuse the rapid

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,640
websites like amazon or ebay

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,280
without spamming or compromise

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
compromising

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
first

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
it targets long-term keywords

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
or more specific or longer phrase

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
with less competition

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
this is how we carry out our study

65
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,480
we firstly infiltrate a typical

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,239
spider pro and thus we get the feature

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,640
we know what's the cheeks they used

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,400
next according to the features we get we

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,440
scan the internet over

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
30 million domains and get about 400 000

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,879
spider pro domains

72
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,920
then

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
we measured

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
these seo domains

75
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,519
to analyze their

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,040
distribution their customers and their

77
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,239
impact on search engines

78
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
finally

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,959
after we finished our paper we deployed

80
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,480
our detection method in badou the

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,959
leading search engine in china

82
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
and we get another one meeting as the

83
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
ultimates

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,040
now let's start from

85
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,959
infiltration

86
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,760
this is the

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,640
website we set up we applied a new

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
domain name for it

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
the content is almost

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
empty but we

91
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,560
have to convince the asus that we really

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
want to do some business

93
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
and

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
we paid about eight dollars to a spider

95
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,240
pro service

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
a service named super spider 4

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,440
and submitted our urls to promote

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
one week later

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
we can see how many times the crawlers

100
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,560
had visited our website through

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
this whiteboard

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,199
it's about 15 000 visits by sc search

103
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,080
engine crawlers

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
and we verified from

105
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,080
both badoo and

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
google that

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
our website was really indexed by

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
both google and the bad tool

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
also

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
we found that many websites many other

111
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
websites

112
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,479
had included

113
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,639
the urls we promoted

114
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
we can

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
see the subdomain names

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
of this website who

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,479
have our urls

118
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,440
then

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,919
the host part

120
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
looked weird

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,919
it looked like

122
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
a random strings

123
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,880
so we tested their dns and verify that

124
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
these domains have

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
wild cardinals enabled that is if we

126
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,000
query any subdomain of it we can get the

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,319
similarity address of the web server

128
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,080
then we visit the this website

129
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,440
uh

130
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
twice

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,120
and

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
we get

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,840
almost the same pages for two visits

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,919
can you notice the difference

135
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,919
the only difference

136
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,240
is titles

137
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,199
but if we check the source code

138
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
we found that

139
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,960
all the harp links inside this page

140
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
are totally different

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,440
so

142
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
to human beings

143
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
to us human beings the appearance is

144
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
almost the same but

145
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
for the computer for

146
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
crawlers from search engines the content

147
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,160
changed completely

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,919
it's a new

149
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,799
website right

150
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,120
the other tricks

151
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
is free writing

152
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
we found many links pointing to ebay

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
amazon or other refuge websites

154
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
with higher

155
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
pitched ranks for example

156
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,599
we should

157
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
with bim research

158
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,919
lucinogen luncheon sorry

159
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,199
and domain ebay.com

160
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,520
we can

161
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
say

162
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
hey

163
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,440
296 results

164
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,520
every item every link has a qq numbers

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
to sell who listened it so

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,039
lose legend is so popular in ebay

167
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,520
what's wrong what's wrong with ebay or

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
what's wrong with bin

169
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
and we try google hallucinogen and

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
domain

171
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,400
amazon.com

172
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,840
even worse we get about

173
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,639
550

174
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,479
results

175
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,479
it's amazing spammed

176
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
or compromised

177
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
we click one of the links

178
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
no

179
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,679
amazon is not spammed not compromised

180
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
right

181
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,640
this is the embedded search engine

182
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,039
of amazon it says that your search did

183
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,680
not match any product

184
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,040
but

185
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,160
we can see the promoted terms

186
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,440
the long tail cures are displayed in

187
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
both title and the search result

188
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
so

189
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
amazon is not spammed but it is used for

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
free writing

191
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
ebay is not spam either but

192
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
the embedded search engine was also

193
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,279
abused to promote long-tail keywords

194
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
now we can draw a picture

195
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,760
how spider pro works

196
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
once a crawler or spider touches one of

197
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
the website

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
controlled by us by default

199
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,319
it will be trapped in the libraries

200
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
the crawlers

201
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,200
can

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
follow the links from one dimension to

203
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
another in a control of the sims by

204
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,839
default

205
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
at the same time this the crawler is fed

206
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,360
with those urls and keywords promoted

207
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,240
and

208
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
even if the spider goes back to the

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
domains it visited before

210
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
it think that

211
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
the website is new

212
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,640
because the domain name and all the

213
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,600
hyperlinks changed completely

214
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
as the greece philosopher harry glitter

215
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
said

216
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,200
no spider can step into the sim side

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
twice

218
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
so for the crawlers the only way to

219
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
escape is to visit the customer's

220
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,279
website or to visit the freewriting link

221
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,040
with promoted messages

222
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
now according to our infiltration we got

223
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,959
four tricks of the all features of its

224
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,399
infrastructure

225
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,279
first

226
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,399
world cup dinners second

227
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
ever changing content

228
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,560
third free writing of refuge website

229
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
and

230
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,519
long tail

231
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
keywords

232
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,880
by now we know how spider 4 works next

233
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
we want to detect all of them

234
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
in the whole internet

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,760
with the features we

236
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,440
get from this infrastructure we designed

237
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
a scanner to promote to to probe

238
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,040
the internet to find other spider pros

239
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
first we collected

240
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,200
about

241
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
30 million domains and 22

242
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
tlds are slds

243
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,000
this is how we collect the database

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
20 of them

245
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
is from

246
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
zoom files we download from the internet

247
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
and the others are from

248
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,959
passive dinos of farsight

249
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600
then we query their dns servers to

250
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,880
verify if they have enabled

251
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
wild card dns

252
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
this step we got about two

253
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
meeting domains

254
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,000
for those demands with wild cardinals

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
enabled we accessed their website

256
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,160
twice

257
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
and compared the similarity of the

258
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
hyperlinks

259
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,360
finally we got about

260
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,880
400 000 domains used by spite4

261
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,160
because we have no ground truth so we

262
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
have to

263
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
verify them manually but it

264
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
is impossible for us to

265
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,040
verify most of this so we sampled

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,000
uh 1000 and

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
verified manually

268
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,240
the first positive is about 0.8 percent

269
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,839
most of the

270
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,279
positive

271
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,760
comes from

272
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,240
some websites who have a lot of ads

273
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
those websites change the links every

274
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
time

275
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
every visit

276
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,079
here is the

277
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
top 10 tlds and

278
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,440
of the spider pro domains

279
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
um

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
china dot cnn is the number one it's not

281
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,880
surprised because most of the services

282
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
are in china

283
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
but for

284
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,839
percentage the number one is pw

285
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,800
pw is the country called top level

286
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
domain for the country

287
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
republic of a plow

288
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,360
more than 17 percent

289
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,040
it was reported by semantic that

290
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,480
pw was extensively abused for email

291
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,320
spamming so

292
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,639
it's not surprised that

293
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
they now are

294
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,160
favored by as users

295
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
by

296
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,600
looking at who is database we saw the

297
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
registration of these seo domains

298
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,839
increased very fast in last year

299
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,399
also by which database we get the top 10

300
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
registers

301
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,680
registers of these seo domains

302
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,480
the

303
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
top 10

304
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
account for 81

305
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,199
of all seo domains

306
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,519
most of them

307
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,800
the

308
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
registrars

309
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
are in china

310
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,160
however

311
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
china has a strict policy on domain

312
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,279
registration

313
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,000
but

314
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
the demands are still

315
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
extensively abused so we think there

316
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,279
must be some policy holds in practice

317
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,480
also by who is database we know that the

318
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
top 10 registry

319
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,240
or

320
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,759
the top 10

321
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,880
people

322
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,759
can choose more than half of the seo

323
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,040
domains

324
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,079
so

325
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,399
we think that

326
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,320
this business the seo business is very

327
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
centralized

328
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,839
from the

329
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
email address

330
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,000
we guess that most of them are chinese

331
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,120
um

332
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,600
we are the web servers hosted

333
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,920
we found most of them

334
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,279
are hosted

335
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
in the united states so

336
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040
the icuers

337
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
buy

338
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
domain names in china

339
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,320
but

340
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
hosted servers

341
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
in america

342
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
why

343
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
i think besides prac

344
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
price considerations

345
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
the policy is another concern in china

346
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
there's an even stricter policy for web

347
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,680
than dns

348
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,519
you must

349
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,000
get icp lessons

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,240
content to provide lessons

351
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,399
from the government to set up a website

352
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
if you set up a web server in the cloud

353
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,959
without

354
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,360
a license the port 80 or http is blocked

355
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,399
so

356
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,160
the s users

357
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,959
have to set up their web servers outside

358
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,839
china

359
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,679
we simple 21 spider pools for detailed

360
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,119
analysis

361
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,400
and monitor them for a month

362
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,119
then we filtered

363
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
15 000 seo domains

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,439
more than

365
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,959
1 000

366
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,439
customer domains and

367
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,240
7 million promoted urls

368
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,120
um

369
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
according to

370
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,760
a free online service we

371
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,000
classify the customer website into

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
seven categories

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,440
we can see more than half of the

374
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
customers

375
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
are illegal as at least in china

376
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,760
so

377
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,720
from the message they promoted we can

378
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,559
get the qq numbers to connect them

379
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,480
i think this information

380
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,799
must be very useful for police to attack

381
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,679
cyber crimes

382
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,480
how are search engines impacted

383
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,520
we selected about

384
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,720
40 long-tail keywords from the

385
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,000
customer messages they promoted

386
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,520
and compared this search result from

387
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,240
both google and the badou

388
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,120
we saw that

389
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
the seo domains appear in the first page

390
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,280
so both of them

391
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
are impacted

392
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
seriously

393
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,960
for example

394
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
research

395
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,960
how much to pay a

396
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,559
prostitute in shenzhen in google

397
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,919
and about do we saw that in the first

398
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,120
page

399
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,400
100

400
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
of the links

401
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
is from

402
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,160
seo demands

403
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
this is the top 20

404
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,679
reputable websites abused by this by the

405
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,640
force

406
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
and their url patents

407
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
the famous ones including

408
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
amazon

409
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
ebay in

410
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,360
america qq.com

411
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,439
and cine.com in china

412
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
okay

413
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
finally after we finished our paper

414
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,360
we deployed our detex method in badou

415
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
collaborated with

416
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,600
colleagues from there too of course

417
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,919
but to give us the urs e the indexed

418
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,039
every day

419
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,600
and we

420
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,799
extract

421
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
the domain names and check if they have

422
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,679
the same features with the slide force

423
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,720
and

424
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,440
with the previous detects method

425
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,679
we get about 300 000 seo domains

426
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
with this domain

427
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,559
we

428
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
crawl the website of

429
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,760
of them

430
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,280
actively and get about

431
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,678
1 million seo demands in total

432
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
this is the numbers of new spider pools

433
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,360
domains

434
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
by do every day

435
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
you can see

436
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
in the last week

437
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,280
the number decreased

438
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,720
maybe i'm not sure maybe we have found

439
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
most of the

440
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,480
seo domains deployed by now

441
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,120
i hope so

442
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
okay in summary

443
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,600
we

444
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
infiltrated a new type of blackhead seo

445
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
service

446
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
and get the features of its

447
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
infrastructure

448
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
then

449
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
we designed our detection systems and

450
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,600
deployed successfully in badou

451
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,440
by now we get about

452
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,720
1.4 million of such as you demands

453
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,320
we expect

454
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
search engines be aware of this news

455
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,480
threat

456
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
and purify the searching the search

457
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,799
result

458
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
and together with those repute

459
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,559
websites like

460
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,240
amazon ebay

461
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
who are

462
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
abused for free writing

463
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
we also inject

464
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,159
i think it's useful information for law

465
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,679
enforcement

466
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,720
for example the qq members

467
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
who

468
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,320
sell hallucinating

469
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,039
if anyone here wants some hallucinogen

470
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,000
you can contact me

471
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,240
this is my email address

472
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
that's all my

473
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,060
thank you very much

474
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:18,720
[Applause]

475
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,600
time for questions

476
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
so let's talk

477
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
for the websites who are abused by free

478
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,640
riding attacks such as ebay

479
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,960
what kind of defense can they deploy to

480
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,640
defend against the freewriting

481
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,480
uh that's a good question um

482
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,039
now for the as viewers it's very easy to

483
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,679
put a static link

484
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,000
and the caller will follow the link to

485
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,520
amazon or

486
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,559
ebay

487
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,159
if they

488
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,039
uh

489
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,840
they

490
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
change the

491
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,000
the access method maybe from get to post

492
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,159
it's harder to

493
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,760
to

494
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,559
to

495
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,039
make such static urls and put them on on

496
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
the website

497
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,720
thank you

498
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,120
thank you

499
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
so you discovered this near black seo i

500
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,520
mean is there any action taken from

501
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,360
these guys are they aware of your

502
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,320
research

503
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,600
sorry so for these uh the spider pool

504
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,919
right group so are they aware of your

505
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,840
detection and research and they didn't

506
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
take any action so they can avoid being

507
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
detected by your

508
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
uh you mean badoo

509
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,679
the these the black spider pool ah

510
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
those who use this their strategies

511
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
right

512
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,360
so are they aware of your research

513
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,919
first of all

514
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,960
uh

515
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
i don't know right now but do you think

516
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
they are taking they are taking some

517
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,840
action so uh you you notice there's some

518
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,240
red reduction of right right is that

519
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
because they are taking some new new

520
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
strategies or to avoid your detection

521
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
uh

522
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,919
yes i think

523
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,320
if no if they know our detect method

524
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
they can change

525
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,840
the

526
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,200
their strategy because we

527
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
now by now we use two

528
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,760
methods one is wildcard dns the other is

529
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
ever-changing content detection

530
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
if they

531
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
disable their dns

532
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,960
well cut

533
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,080
and

534
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,960
maybe our detection will fill but

535
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,320
they must pay a lot of money for more

536
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
domains right

537
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,279
and if they

538
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,320
don't

539
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,200
change their content so frequently we

540
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,760
cannot detect them but

541
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,720
also

542
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,000
the search engine will not visit them so

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
frequently

544
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,960
so if they give up these two methods

545
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
we won right

546
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
yeah good more question

547
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,120
krista wilson northeastern

548
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
so i'm curious of how difficult it would

549
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,480
be to actually detect this so if i was

550
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
google i would construct the web graph

551
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,559
and it seems like these sites would form

552
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,919
a large

553
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,320
dense component right there's many nodes

554
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,600
but they have they're all linked to each

555
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,400
other and there's few edges going in and

556
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,159
out of this component so i could do some

557
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,159
community detection and this should just

558
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,640
pop out as something very suspicious

559
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,159
it's not sort of integrated with the

560
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,520
rest of the graph

561
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
is that intuition correct

562
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,400
or are these sites actually

563
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
well enough integrated with the rest of

564
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,159
the web graph that you couldn't find

565
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
this sort of obviously

566
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
uh

567
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
sorry can you repeat your question

568
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,440
yeah so i'm

569
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,000
i'm curious if google could detect these

570
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,640
sites the spider trap

571
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,600
so if you think about the the web as a

572
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,480
graph

573
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
right every one of these domains is a

574
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,200
node they all point to each other yeah

575
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,559
they form a dense component right

576
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,960
but there's very few edges from them to

577
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
the rest of the web

578
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,120
so it seems like community detection

579
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
should find them pretty easily

580
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
uh

581
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,000
yes right

582
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
but

583
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,000
according to our measurement

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,159
one spider have

585
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,520
a lot of

586
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
domain names

587
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,400
and

588
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
they distribute in many

589
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,559
es

590
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,919
so it consumes a lot of time to

591
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,720
to get all of them for

592
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
the search engines

593
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,159
uh

594
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,080
yes you're right if you

595
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
have enough resource

596
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,279
enough time you can detect that and

597
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,320
we

598
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,799
according to our measurement

599
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,520
all the nodes websites

600
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,360
uh connect each hardly they construct

601
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,559
a mesh

602
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,480
so if you can do that

603
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
yes you can

604
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
get all of them

605
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,559
out thank you

606
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,520
so

607
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
wonderful research um i just want to

608
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
comment to professor group that if you

609
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,880
search in google spider pool i just went

610
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
to translate and translated the number

611
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,080
one hit is from december 2015. it's a

612
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,399
forum posting and i auto translate it

613
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,640
and it's complaining baidu has killed

614
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,000
the spider pool

615
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,520
uh we're very angry and and it is equal

616
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,440
to the white hair and you need to send a

617
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,080
hammer i guess this is some kind of uh

618
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
send a hammer it's some kind of netspeak

619
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,240
in chinese which doesn't translate very

620
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,600
well

621
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,840
so your research has been effective and

622
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,600
they also explain in that

623
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
posting why they choose us servers

624
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,279
because you need a lot of bandwidth and

625
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,440
you need a lot of power so they say

626
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,520
hosting in the us is very cheap

627
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,399
in amazon so you better do that and also

628
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,559
in cloud traffic is free so you don't

629
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,480
pay for all this traffic that the spider

630
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
is causing

631
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
but what i also notice is that there are

632
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,919
400 000

633
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,640
uh search results in google for spider

634
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,520
pool

635
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,799
so

636
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,279
i wonder why are they doing seo on the

637
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
word spider pool

638
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,520
in your understanding

639
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,679
sorry promotion right so are they doing

640
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,120
some promotion so they are getting

641
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,918
popular maybe more popular

642
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
you mean

643
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,440
that spider put these guys themselves

644
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
how do they get people to know about

645
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
their service right yes they are doing

646
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,559
it promote

647
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,399
themselves by other spider phone

648
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,039
yeah it's a meta spider pool yes yes we

649
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,399
we we do

650
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,760
see some

651
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,480
uh

652
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,360
phenomenal phenomenon also in badou

653
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,960
yeah right

654
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,480
okay so thank you very much thank you

655
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,000
yeah let's thank the speaker one more

656
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,720
time thank you
