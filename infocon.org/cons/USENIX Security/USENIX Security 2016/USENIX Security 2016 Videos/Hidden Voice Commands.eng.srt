1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,799
so yes my name is nicholas and i'm going

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,719
to be talking about our paper hidden

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,039
voice commands this is joint work with

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
my co-authors pratyush tavish yunkai

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,720
micah clay david and wen ciao

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,519
so

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,960
a little bit of backgrounds before i get

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,840
started

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,720
so

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
devices have increasingly been using

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,399
voice recognition

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,079
as one of their primary modes of

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
interaction so we have phones

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,399
tablets

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,680
smart watches now use speech recognition

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,000
and other devices who's basically their

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
only mode of interaction is through

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
speech recognition with the amazon echo

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
now speech recognition opens up new

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
possibilities for attacks because the

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,199
voice channel is unauthenticated it's

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
possible for me to give your device a

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
command and your device won't actually

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
know that it's me who gave it the action

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,119
the device has no notion of who it is

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,080
who their owner is

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
so today you can imagine that it'd be

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,080
very easy for me to walk up to your

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
device and if it's listening for speech

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
recognition say

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,119
okay please

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,600
text some premium sms number and your

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
device would take this action now of

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
course it has to be listening for

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
commands but if it is this is something

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
i could do today

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
in a future not too far from now you can

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
imagine that

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,880
you could walk up someone else's device

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
and say okay

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,640
tech us please pay someone else a

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
hundred dollars and we are actually

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,399
seeing that this sort of um feature is

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,040
going to be implemented um siri has um

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,360
or apple has said that siri's api is

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
going to be released to third party

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,000
developers and payment providers have

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
actually said that they want to allow

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
this for convenience

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
so this is a potential serious problem

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,799
in the near future

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,040
so what we're going to do is we're going

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
to show you that we can actually make

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
these commands stealthy so it's hard for

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
a user to understand what is actually

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
being said when the device is controlled

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
one of the primary reasons why this

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
attack is not terribly appealing today

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,879
is that if i walk up to you and command

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
your device you'll be aware that your

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
device was commanded and can probably

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
try and undo the action and also

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,440
will be able to confront me having just

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
made this action with your device

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
specifically what we're going to do is

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
we're going to produce audio which

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,239
sounds like noise to humans but sounds

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,959
like speech to devices

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,840
so

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
this is audio which when you hear it

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,640
it's just going to sound like something

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
that's a random noise but when your

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
device hears it is going to actually

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
recognize some particular type of

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
command

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
and you should think of this generally

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
in the problem of space of attacks on

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
machine learning so speech recognition

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
is just a machine learning task

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
and what we're going to do is we're

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
going to produce some audio which in

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
reality should have the class of

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
non-speech

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
but the machine learning algorithm is

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
going to classify it as speech and even

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
more it's going to classify it as a

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,080
given phrase that we want it to hear

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
so before i actually start talking about

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
how the attacks work i need to give you

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
a little bit of background

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
on how speech recognition works

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,879
so speech recognition basically is a

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,239
machine learning problem so we start

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
with some audio we feed this into a

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
machine learning algorithm and feed that

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
and it gives us output text

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
now of course it's not obvious actually

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
the simple because the input space is

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,280
very very high dimensional so audio is

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
sampled at something like 44 000 times

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,519
per second if we have five seconds of

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,519
audio there's a quarter million features

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,720
and machine learning does not really

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
handle this very well when mapping only

105
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
down to a couple of words

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,040
so we do is we split this in half and we

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,640
split this into two pieces of a feature

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,319
extractor and then a machine learning

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
algorithm so the idea of the feature

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,519
extractor is we're going to try and

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,280
reduce the dimensionality of the input

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
from something very high dimensional to

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,319
something very small dimensional and

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,519
then we're going to take those small

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,360
dimensional feature vectors and feed

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
those through this machine learning

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,840
algorithm to give us the output

118
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,360
text now there are lots of choices of

119
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,798
what machine learning algorithm we want

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,680
to use

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,358
traditionally this was a hidden markov

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,519
model used almost exclusively but more

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
recently people have begun using

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
recurrent neural networks in order to

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,520
give slightly better results

126
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
our attacks are basically agnostic to

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,960
the machine learning algorithm that's

128
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,479
being used so i'm not really going to

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
discuss that further what we need to

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,919
talk about a little bit more is how the

131
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,000
feature extraction works because that's

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
what's different in this domain

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,440
so

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
for feature extraction we start out with

135
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
some really long input signal

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
and what we're going to do is we're

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
going to split this into a series of

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,080
overlapping frames so we're going to

139
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
split this to be the first frame

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
second frame third frame

141
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
and now for each frame

142
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
we're going to

143
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
call a function which is called the mfc

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
on each of these frames to give us the

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
feature vector the mfc you can think of

146
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,400
basically as the fourier transform plus

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
some additional stuff to reduce the

148
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
dimensionality a little bit further

149
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,320
basically we're transitioning into the

150
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
frequency space and then doing a little

151
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
bit of processing on the frequency space

152
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,560
so we do this for each of the frames to

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
give us the feature vectors x0 x1 x2 and

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
then these feature vectors again are fed

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
into the machine learning algorithm and

156
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,199
then from there we get the text

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,680
okay so that's the background that i

158
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,919
need to give in order to explain how our

159
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,800
attacks are going to work so the first

160
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
attack i'm going to present is a white

161
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
box attack where

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,080
we assume complete knowledge of the

163
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
system the model and everything else we

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
might need to know in order to attack it

165
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,800
so

166
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
if you recall that how the processing

167
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
works with recognition is we start on

168
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
the left and work our way towards the

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,039
right to to get the output phrase we

170
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,639
want to hear what we're going to do for

171
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,919
our attack since we have complete

172
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,680
knowledge of everything is we're going

173
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
to start from the right with the text

174
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,919
that we want for the device here and

175
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,000
sort of work our way backwards

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
so we start with this text and we run it

177
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
backwards through the machine learning

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
algorithm to find some feature vectors

179
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,759
so that if we can hit those feature

180
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
vectors when run forwards through the

181
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
machine learning algorithm it would

182
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,280
produce the text that we want to hear

183
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
we then take those feature vectors and

184
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
run those backwards

185
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,400
through the feature extractor and this

186
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
gives us some audio so that if we could

187
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,840
produce this audio would give us the

188
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
correct feature vectors which again

189
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
going are going to give us the correct

190
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
output classification of the text

191
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,639
so in order to do this i need to be able

192
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,720
to convince you that we can invert both

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
the machine learning algorithm and that

194
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
we can invert the feature extractor

195
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
now it turns out that previous work has

196
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,199
covered the machine learning algorithm

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
part for us

198
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,919
if you're familiar with the work on

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
image recognition

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
it's been shown that it's very

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
straightforward to produce images which

202
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
look like anything you might want but

203
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
have a very strong classification as any

204
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
image you might want for example a

205
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
school bus

206
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
this is all done and we sort of take

207
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
that work

208
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
what's different in our space is the

209
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,720
feature extractor on image recognition

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
the feature extractor is basically an

211
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,560
identity function it takes each pixel

212
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,280
independently maps it onto the color of

213
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
on projected into red green and blue and

214
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
then feeds that the machine learning

215
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
algorithm we have something much more

216
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,560
difficult here because our feature

217
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
extractor is highly non-linear and

218
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
features are not independent

219
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,039
so how do we invert the feature

220
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,319
extractor

221
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,080
so the first simple thing that you might

222
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,639
try would be to take each feature

223
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
sort of come up with an inverse mfc

224
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
function

225
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,280
and map each feature onto some audio

226
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
and then say okay good i have this audio

227
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,479
merge the audio together and everything

228
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,440
works

229
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
and you could try that and it wouldn't

230
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
work and the reason why it's not going

231
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
to work is that if you remember that

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,720
these frames are overlapping

233
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
so in particular the second half of the

234
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
first frame needs to be equal to the

235
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
first half of the second frame which in

236
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
this case it's not so if you try and

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
merge it will fail and again the second

238
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
half of the second frame needs to be

239
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
equal to the first half of the third

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,879
frame and it's not so this will fail and

241
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
so when you actually try and merge these

242
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,160
what you're going to end up with is

243
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
something that's not a valid

244
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
reconstruction and so the attack won't

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
succeed

246
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
so instead what we're going to do is

247
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
we're going to do this sort of one frame

248
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
at a time we're going to start with the

249
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
first frame and do exactly the same

250
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,799
thing and just take the inverse mfc

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,039
now what we're going to do

252
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
is take the second half of this frame

253
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
and fix it to be the first half of the

254
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,719
second frame

255
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,159
we're going to say that is fixed you

256
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,399
can't change it leave it like that now

257
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,600
given that

258
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
given and given the second feature

259
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
vector

260
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
we're going to try and find an inverse

261
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,839
and only change the second half of the

262
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,040
second frame

263
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
and we do this with standard black box

264
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
gradient descent where we have fixed the

265
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
first half of the frame and we're going

266
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,560
to try and target something so that when

267
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
we run forwards through the mfc we get

268
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
something very close to the desired

269
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,200
feature vector so this gives us

270
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
the second half of the second frame

271
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,360
now we're going to do the same thing

272
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
again we're going to copy the second

273
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
half of the second frame down to the

274
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
first half of the third frame

275
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,920
and say okay that is fixed you cannot

276
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,720
change it given that please find us the

277
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
second half of this third frame that

278
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
produces something which is very very

279
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200
close to the next feature vector

280
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
we work our way through one frame at a

281
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
time going through in this way until we

282
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
end up with something which is a

283
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
complete reconstruction

284
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
and now merging everything becomes very

285
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,480
easy

286
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
because we have ensured that each of the

287
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,279
frames all line up

288
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,360
so given that

289
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,519
um it's actually not actually that easy

290
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
um i've lied a little bit um all the

291
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
details are in the paper but there are a

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
lot of things i can't really talk about

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,800
today um

294
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
in the amount of time i have but the one

295
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,399
thing i want to call up in particular is

296
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,000
that

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,800
when playing these attacks um it only is

298
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
an interesting attack if i can play it

299
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
from a speaker and record it with a

300
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
microphone and it still works there is

301
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
no useful threat model where i generate

302
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
an attack on my computer and as an mp3

303
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
file and feed that directly into the

304
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
machine learning algorithm so we show

305
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
that we can actually get around this by

306
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
creating a model of the physical channel

307
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,519
what happens when you play it over the

308
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,560
air

309
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
we use this model in our attack

310
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
generation and we even go a little bit

311
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
further and we actually play our attacks

312
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,480
over the air during the generation so

313
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
this is sort of an online algorithm that

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
plays plays attacks as it's going and

315
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,079
improves the attacks to the point that

316
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
they actually work when played over a

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
speaker and then recorded with the

318
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
microphone

319
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,760
so with that let me get to a brief demo

320
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,079
of what this actually sounds like

321
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,519
and with luck everything will work

322
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
okay a sound hopefully loud enough

323
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
so

324
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,839
first attack let's see what it sounds

325
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,839
like

326
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
okay so that's the first attack what was

327
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,079
it saying it was saying okay google take

328
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,120
a picture

329
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
so if you're if your phone was listening

330
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
to this or oh so i should say this is

331
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
the white box attack so this is not

332
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
targeting the google systems

333
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
but if you're if if the device so we

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
target cmu sphinx cmu sphinx listening

335
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
to this would would would hear okay

336
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,760
google take a picture

337
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,480
second second demo

338
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,440
that one

339
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,160
was okay google text one two three four

340
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,360
five

341
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
and and third one

342
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
this one

343
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,160
was ok google browse to evil.com

344
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,440
now one interesting thing that you

345
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,279
should note about like how the human

346
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,480
frame works is now that i've told you

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,399
what this is it's okay google browse to

348
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,399
evil.com i'm going to go back and play

349
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,240
exactly that same thing again and you're

350
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
probably going to be able to sort of

351
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
hear what it is that was said so i'm

352
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,160
going to play this demo one more time

353
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
so i played exactly the same sounds but

354
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,560
now that i've told you that you can sort

355
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,600
of hear what it was that was being

356
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
saying

357
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,760
so

358
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
um we can actually change our attacks a

359
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,240
little bit so if we if we don't use the

360
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
over-the-air playing phase

361
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
um the attacks are substantially more

362
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
difficult to understand and so i'm going

363
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,279
to tell you this is this is again

364
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
exactly the same thing now that you know

365
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
what it is again it's okay google browse

366
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
to evil.com let's see if you can hear

367
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,519
what this one will be saying which works

368
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
only if you create as an mp3 file does

369
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
not work when played over the air

370
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
all right that was it so this this

371
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,440
attack works correctly when fed in as an

372
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
mp3 file of course it doesn't work when

373
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
played over the air but we can sort of

374
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
think of this as the upper bound of what

375
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,399
an attacker might be able to do if

376
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
someone could improve our results have

377
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
played over the year someone who knows

378
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
more about physics and

379
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
the mechanics of the speaker work than i

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
do

381
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
so that something like that is sort of

382
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,720
how difficult it could become

383
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,839
so

384
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,040
there are some limitations here um

385
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
the primary one is again that this is a

386
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
white box attack so we're assuming

387
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,959
complete knowledge of all of the model

388
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,880
which isn't really a realistic thing we

389
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,760
can do

390
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,279
the other thing is that

391
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,720
this attack actually turns out doesn't

392
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
work terribly well with background noise

393
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
or echoes in a room

394
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,680
which is another unrealistic assumption

395
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
so the obvious question then is can we

396
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
resolve some of these some of these

397
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
problems

398
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
can in other words can we make this

399
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
attack practical and remove the white

400
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
box attack assumption

401
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,360
so we do this

402
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
and we do this at the expense of a

403
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,959
little bit of attack quality so that the

404
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,360
attack now is going to sound a little

405
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
bit more easy to understand but is

406
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
actually going to be able to be applied

407
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,519
to actual phones that people have

408
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,120
so

409
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
how does the black box attack work

410
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,959
well

411
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,560
since we don't have complete knowledge

412
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
of the model we can't start with the

413
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,680
phrase we wanted to hear and work our

414
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
way with inverses because we don't

415
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
actually know how to compute the inverse

416
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,800
so instead what we're going to do is

417
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,839
we're going to take an approach that's

418
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,839
sort of like fuzzing we're going to take

419
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
some actual human saying some phrase we

420
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
wanted to hear

421
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
as some input audio

422
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,880
we're going to feed this through

423
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,079
something we're going to call an audio

424
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,839
obfuscator you can think of this sort of

425
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,600
like something that makes random changes

426
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
and this will give us a candidate

427
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
obfuscated command

428
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
we're going to test if this candidate

429
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,040
obfuscated commands works when applied

430
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
to the actual speech recognition api and

431
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,519
see what the phrases that's outputted

432
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,360
if it's not the right phrase then we

433
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,880
just reject it and try another random

434
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,440
modification and if it is

435
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
then we keep it

436
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
and we'll listen to the ones that we

437
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,440
that we actually generate the very end

438
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,560
and pick the one that's the most

439
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,320
difficult for a human to understand

440
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
now the obvious question is what do we

441
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,320
do in this audio obfuscator you can

442
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
imagine that most changes will either

443
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
make the commands not recognized

444
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
correctly or be too easy for a human to

445
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,320
understand

446
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
so what we do is we split this again

447
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
into two pieces where we're going to use

448
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,760
the fact

449
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,079
that the mfc the the feature extraction

450
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,680
function i introduced earlier does a

451
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
good job at extracting the important

452
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,480
pieces of information out of the audio

453
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,519
so what we're going to do is we're going

454
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,440
to take the input audio and feed it

455
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
through the mfc to get some feature

456
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,440
vectors and then immediately invert it

457
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
so we're not really assuming that the

458
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,720
speech recognition algorithm actually

459
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
uses the mfc we're just using this as a

460
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
way to constrain our

461
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,399
our fuzzing approach

462
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,360
so

463
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
the reason why this works is that since

464
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,880
the mfc maps down to a much smaller

465
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
dimensional space there is necessarily a

466
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
large number of inputs that the inverse

467
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
can map onto so by controlling the

468
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
parameters used in the mfc and which

469
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,519
inputs we map from the in from the

470
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
feature space onto the audio space

471
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
we can control how much noise we want to

472
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,880
add

473
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,279
you can think of this sort of as fuzzing

474
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,680
but with the constraint that the initial

475
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
phrase and the obfuscated command have

476
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,920
the same mfc feature vectors

477
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,519
so this is how we do our black box

478
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,800
attack and so the evaluation for this

479
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,079
we can show

480
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
actually works very well in practice

481
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,759
so

482
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,880
what you're going to see here is you're

483
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
going to see a phone sitting on the

484
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
bottom of a table this is sitting

485
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
closest to the camera and the back of

486
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
the table is

487
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,959
sitting 10 feet away some speakers

488
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,240
these are just relatively standard

489
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
speakers this is a standard office room

490
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
there's nothing special about those

491
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
and we're going to play some commands

492
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
coming from those speakers and we're

493
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
going to see what the phone does

494
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,680
go to google.com

495
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,079
so if you didn't hear it just said

496
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,320
opening web page and what it's doing is

497
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,399
it's opening xkcd.com

498
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,759
because that was the phrase that we told

499
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,440
it to do

500
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
so even stronger what we can do is we

501
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
can show that this attack actually works

502
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
with background noise so here i've

503
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
zoomed into the phone so that we can see

504
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
that see what the phone is doing better

505
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
and additionally what's going to happen

506
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
is that this conference room has

507
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
overhead speakers and we're going to

508
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
play from those overhead speakers some

509
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
background noise to make this attack a

510
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,079
little bit more difficult

511
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,319
for us

512
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,959
and this attack was turn on airplane

513
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,119
mode and so that is what the phone has

514
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,599
gone and done

515
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,080
and one final demo

516
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,919
again same setup this time still with

517
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,640
background noise

518
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,120
and again you can hear the background

519
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,799
noise

520
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,360
and we will ask it to show facebook.com

521
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,480
and we're going to zoom out and show

522
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,080
again same setup

523
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,919
same speaker sitting 10 feet away with

524
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,720
the phone on the table

525
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
okay

526
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
so

527
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
brief comparison between the two the

528
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
white box attack works on an open system

529
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
but and the commands are heavy heavily

530
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,440
obfuscated but the black box attack

531
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,520
works on any system you could think of

532
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
but the attacks are slightly easier to

533
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
understand

534
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
both of these

535
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,360
um work when played correctly over the

536
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,240
air

537
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
so we can actually play it coming from a

538
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,640
speaker recording from a microphone

539
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
but the white box attack doesn't

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
tolerate background noise when the black

541
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
box attack does

542
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
so all of this attack work leads to some

543
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
obvious questions about defenses

544
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,240
so we do some relatively thorough study

545
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,080
of defenses on our paper and break them

546
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
down into three main categories the

547
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
first category of defense are defenses

548
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
that simply notify the user an action

549
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
was taken so this can be something as

550
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,200
simple as a beep or maybe

551
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
the phone saying exactly what it is

552
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
that's going to do so at least you're

553
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
aware of what it is that was done

554
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,880
the second type of defense are defenses

555
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,559
that challenge the user to perform some

556
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
action so you can think of this being

557
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,559
something simple like if you're sure you

558
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,240
want to take this action

559
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
please touch the ok button on your phone

560
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,919
and this has obvious usability issues

561
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,799
but it would stop most of these attacks

562
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
from from working because it assumes

563
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
physical location access to the device

564
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,880
and

565
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
the third type of defense are defenses

566
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,799
which try and detect and prevent this

567
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,480
from occurring so you can think of these

568
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
as defenses which are passive running on

569
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
the phone and trying trying to

570
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
distinguish the difference between real

571
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
human speech and actual attack commands

572
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
so one attack or one type of defense

573
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
that we consider here is

574
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
an audio obj

575
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
sorry is an audio filter which slightly

576
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,120
degrades the quality of the input so

577
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,960
that human speech still remains human

578
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
speech but slightly degraded and attack

579
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,840
commands are now sufficiently degraded

580
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,400
so that they no longer are recognized by

581
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
the speech recognition

582
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
another defense that we i want to bring

583
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,720
particular attention to are

584
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
classification-based defenses so we

585
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,200
train a very simple linear machine

586
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
learning model based on some standard

587
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
features extracted from audio to

588
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
distinguish the difference between valid

589
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
commands and our attack commands and

590
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
this works with something like 99

591
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
accuracy

592
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,280
now even more importantly what we can

593
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
show is that we can train this

594
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
classifier on the white box attack and

595
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
on human speech and it will detect the

596
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
black box attack and similarly we can

597
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,159
train on black box attack and human

598
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,679
speech and it will detect the white box

599
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
attack despite that these are two very

600
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,120
different attack approaches

601
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
so the machine learning algorithm is at

602
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
least not trivially broken and we're not

603
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,679
going to try and claim that this is

604
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,760
going to be the secure solution but it's

605
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
sort of an indication that something

606
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,960
like this might work in the future

607
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,600
so with that i'd like to conclude very

608
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,559
briefly

609
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,240
um

610
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,039
speech recognition brings many new

611
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
possible attacks and our hidden voice

612
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,799
commands are something which are

613
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,840
practical and work

614
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,280
today but the impact of these attacks is

615
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,520
only going to increase as devices allow

616
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,919
us to take more and more actions through

617
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,280
the voice channel

618
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
we hope that future work will evaluate

619
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
potential defenses because this is a

620
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
very interesting area where the attacks

621
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,039
are not currently being widely deployed

622
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,600
so we have some time to construct some

623
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,679
sound defenses which might actually be

624
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,240
able to be deployed in devices and with

625
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
that thank you for attention and i'll

626
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,480
now take any questions

627
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,530
[Applause]

628
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,840
hi uh stefan savage ucsd uh really

629
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,159
interesting work uh i had a few a few

630
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
questions actually so uh one was i'm

631
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
curious about the sensitivity of

632
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
your work to compression because the

633
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,960
obvious mass

634
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,760
delivery channel is like fm radio and so

635
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
i'm wondering if this works

636
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
when you shove it through that kind of

637
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,960
signal but

638
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,080
and let me i'm gonna ask the second

639
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
question i can get out of the way which

640
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,159
is i'm i'm very interested in the

641
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,679
potential application of this in a

642
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,440
covert context right so if i hear that

643
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
thing i don't necessarily know what it

644
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
is but i know there's something weird

645
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
that went on so what i'm wondering if

646
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,720
you thought at all

647
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,679
about

648
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,200
exploring

649
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
uh the extent to which you can hide

650
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,480
these kinds of commands in something

651
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
that in fact does not in and of itself

652
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
sounds suspicious you know the noise

653
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,240
in music or something like that but will

654
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
be interpreted as speech by

655
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
okay sure yeah so i'll answer the

656
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,280
compression part first so um

657
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,120
we haven't evaluated that thoroughly i

658
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
can tell you that in the white box

659
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
attack command the commands are

660
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,520
recognized more heavily as speech than

661
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
as me talking so because we're able to

662
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,799
invert the thing

663
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
entirely we're able to generate things

664
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,120
which are like as good quality speech as

665
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,039
you could want and so i would imagine i

666
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,640
can't i can't say for sure that the

667
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,880
attack would work on the black box side

668
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
i'm i think compression might might help

669
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
in the same way that an audio filter

670
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,159
degrades the quality of everything and

671
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,080
that might help there but again i'm not

672
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
really sure

673
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039
my concern with compression is that

674
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,960
compression sometimes even if it's lossy

675
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
compression is sort of somewhat

676
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,320
invertible and we might be able to

677
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
construct audio which after

678
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,159
uncompression produces exactly what we

679
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,159
want

680
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,480
for your other comment uh

681
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,919
so yes these attacks sound somewhat

682
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,679
weird but if yesterday um you were

683
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
sitting and you hadn't heard this work

684
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
um and you heard something like this and

685
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
like you were sitting down enjoying your

686
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,799
coffee

687
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,080
i don't think you would have thought it

688
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,240
was an attack targeting your phone i

689
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
think you might have thought oh that's

690
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
weird and then immediately gone back to

691
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
sort of enjoying your coffee but now

692
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,679
yeah no yes

693
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,000
now now you now you know or not yeah so

694
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
so now you know is it possible is it

695
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,840
possible to like hide this in music i

696
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,720
think that would be a wonderful

697
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,279
application we weren't able to do that

698
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
but that doesn't mean it's impossible i

699
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,960
would imagine that it could be done

700
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
the reason why we couldn't do it for

701
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,200
even the white box setting

702
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
is that the mfc works basically over the

703
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
features

704
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,559
over the um

705
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
frequency domain

706
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,320
and so when you're working over the

707
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
frequency domain there's only so much

708
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
you can do

709
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
but it might still be possible to do

710
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,279
this um but we weren't able to get it to

711
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,279
work

712
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
hi uh jayan jang microsoft research

713
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,080
great work um so i don't know much about

714
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
okay google but

715
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,279
so other voice assistants they use some

716
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,279
like personalization

717
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
so they use some personal officials they

718
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,600
do speaker identification and then so

719
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,080
the keyword detection like hey cortana

720
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
or siri

721
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,960
those are uh i guess individual agnostic

722
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,760
but the comments uh they try to use some

723
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,240
personal voice features to personalize

724
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,320
uh detections and so on so that's that

725
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,080
do you think your attacks would be

726
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,320
equally applicable to sure

727
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
so um as for so for devices which try

728
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
and uh ask like is it my owner who's

729
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
speaking right now the only thing i'm

730
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,159
aware of is some devices try and do

731
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,880
pitch detection in order not not as a

732
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,600
defense but mainly as a way so that two

733
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,120
people in the same room don't

734
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,320
accidentally control each other's

735
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
devices

736
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
and so because it's not actually meant

737
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
as a defense i'm not going i'm not sure

738
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
that it's actually going to help here i

739
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
think that something like this could

740
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,840
work in the future if you were able to

741
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
have some kind of strong speaker

742
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,400
detection

743
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
the one concern i would have is that

744
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
speaker detection traditionally

745
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
uses mfcc feature vectors which are

746
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,480
exactly what we've shown we can invert

747
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
so i'm not necessarily sure if it

748
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,039
would be impossible to simultaneously

749
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,559
invert the feature vectors of the

750
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,039
speaker detection along with

751
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,240
actually making it have the target

752
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,679
phrase we wanted to hear i think that

753
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,640
would be interesting work if someone

754
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,360
could show that okay all right thank you

755
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,919
i'll just reduce google i'm curious how

756
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,279
robust your attack is against changes to

757
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
the speech detection model on the server

758
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,200
side do you have to retrain your attack

759
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,279
each time google or apple or microsoft

760
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,840
pushes a new

761
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
model on their side to detect voice or

762
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,559
does it work across releases

763
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,840
i'm going to toss that to my co-author

764
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,799
who can answer this question

765
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
yes so the answer would be like yes we

766
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,600
would have to retrain for the black box

767
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,039
attack if the server-side speech

768
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,880
recognition engine changes uh because

769
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,640
the way we generate our attack commands

770
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
for the black box attack is we feed it

771
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
to the current instance of the speaker

772
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
the speech recognition system and get

773
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
back the outputs so if things change on

774
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,440
the background yes we would have to

775
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200
retrain our attack

776
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,640
thank you

777
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
hi i'm daniel genkin from television

778
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,760
technion

779
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,919
have you tried hiding

780
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,919
the hiding the the voice that you

781
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,240
produce up in frequencies such that it's

782
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
above the audible human range for for

783
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,320
humans but still picked up by the

784
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
microphone yeah and for the second

785
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
question have you tried using highly

786
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
directional piezoelectric components

787
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
that you can aim at a phone without

788
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,200
anybody near just ever hearing whatever

789
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
is being said so this would allow you to

790
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,799
hide it even more okay can you repeat

791
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,799
your second question

792
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,760
there are

793
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,159
there are highly directional speakers

794
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,679
highly directional speakers yeah you can

795
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
just aim it at the phone

796
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,039
as accurate as laser pointers and and

797
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,960
then nobody can hear nobody's standing

798
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,399
in front of unless you're standing in

799
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,760
front of the speaker you can can't even

800
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
hear it sure um so we haven't tried

801
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,840
highly directionized speakers

802
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,240
i don't know how they work they may may

803
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,679
not work

804
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,399
for

805
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,760
the the first question on um

806
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,679
can we raise this into some like sound

807
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,720
that humans can't hear unfortunately no

808
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
the very first thing that most speech

809
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,080
recognition algorithms do is have a

810
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
band-pass filter where they filter out

811
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,360
everything below

812
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,120
80 hertz where which a human can produce

813
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
and everything above 4 000 hertz

814
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
basically keep only the things that the

815
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,520
human

816
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,840
voice can keep

817
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,679
anyway yeah that was actually my exact

818
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,559
question too so if you if you use the

819
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,600
nyquist problem and you send frequencies

820
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,480
at if you're sampling at 44.1 kilohertz

821
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
okay if you if you have a better speaker

822
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,799
and you can transmit a sound at

823
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,200
44

824
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,679
kilohertz

825
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,559
plus

826
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,520
or two times 44 kilohertz minus four

827
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,919
kilohertz okay speaker will pick it up

828
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,720
as a four kilohertz sound i say sorry

829
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
the microphone will pick it up as a four

830
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
kilohertz sound but you won't be able to

831
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
hear anything um

832
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,960
yes that might work

833
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,799
i would be i would be concerned about

834
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
making this actually work when play

835
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,399
when played over

836
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,559
a speaker and recorded by a microphone

837
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,320
that wasn't high quality because if the

838
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,559
the time samples weren't exactly when

839
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,720
you wanted them to and if you're playing

840
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,120
at something you have 44 times two

841
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,960
kilohertz you need a good speaker you

842
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,799
need a really good yeah you might need a

843
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,320
really really nice speaker and also need

844
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
to make sure that

845
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,279
you don't control what the microphone is

846
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,120
the microphone is a cheap mic sitting on

847
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,240
a phone

848
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
that should be fine uh okay so yeah so

849
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,080
i'm not an audio engineer but so if you

850
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,360
if you say that this might be possible

851
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
it might be possible um i think that

852
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,640
would be that would be a nice thing to

853
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,799
be able to show um if you would if

854
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,360
someone could do that

855
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,550
