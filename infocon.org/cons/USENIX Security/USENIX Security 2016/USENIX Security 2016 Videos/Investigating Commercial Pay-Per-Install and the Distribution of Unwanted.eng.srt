1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
thank you everybody for coming again my

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,200
name is kurt thomas i'm research

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
scientist at google and today i'm going

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
to talk about a joint project been doing

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,160
with new york university and the

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,000
international computer science institute

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
on understanding the marketplace of

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,279
purchasing installers on a user's

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,279
machine

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,599
so for over two years now we've been

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
seeing millions of users exhibiting

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,599
symptoms of unwanted software these are

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,160
things like ad injectors that inject new

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
content onto youtube

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
pc cleanup utilities that purport to

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,399
identify thousands of errors on a user's

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
machine and offer a subscription fee to

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,239
clean it up and browser settings

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
hijackers that modify the default search

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,320
engine and replace it to sell that

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
traffic

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
we received over like 100 000 user

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,760
complaints related to these types of

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
symptoms so we know it's a nuisance to

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
users but we didn't really understand

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
how that software was actually getting

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,559
onto the victim's machine in the first

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,480
place

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
so we started to look into this

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
marketplace known as commercial paper

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
install and it says practice of when you

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
go and download a piece of software that

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,720
will bundle several additional offers at

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,479
install time so if you go to

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
download.com or any other popular

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,159
download portal it's very often you'll

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
see one of these dialogues like those

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
shown above

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
and while bundling in and of itself

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,799
isn't an abusive practice very often

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
these consent dialogues are buried

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,520
within like walls of text or fail to

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
accurately disclose the type of software

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
that's going to be installed on the

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,640
user's machine

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
even worse users often encounter these

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
bundles through deceptive promotional

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
practices so if you go to a video site

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,640
and you see your video codec is out of

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
date or you need to install some video

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,079
player it's very likely that that's

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
going to lead to a bundle that installs

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
unwanted software

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
likewise if you go to a very popular

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,240
torrent site and the most prominent

56
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
button is download button that's likely

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,759
an advertisement that leads unwanted

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,439
software not actually the torrent

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
tracker

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
so what i want to talk about today is

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
kind of our year-long investigation into

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
this marketplace the bundling and what's

63
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
going on and the particular questions we

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
wanted to answer are what is the

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
relationship between the people who are

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
behind this commercial bundling and

67
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
unwanted software developers

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,480
and also what are the deceptive

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
promotional tools that are being used

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
within this ecosystem to trick or coerce

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,360
users into actually consenting to these

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
terms of service

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
and ultimately understand the negative

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
impact that it has on users

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
because at the end of this talk what i

76
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
hope to get across with you is how huge

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
a problem this is for users and

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
hopefully that the rest of the community

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
gets on board is tackling unwanted

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
software as is prominent a problem to

81
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
say drive-by downloads or social

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,720
engineering

83
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
so to get started i want to give just a

84
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,840
little bit of a behind-the-scenes

85
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
perspective of what goes on when you

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
launch one of those commercial bundles

87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
so it turns out that commercial ppi is

88
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
operated like an affiliate market

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,280
so what you start with is a set of

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
advertisers who are software developers

91
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,599
willing to purchase installs they don't

92
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
really have a distribution mechanism in

93
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,640
their own you don't really have a strong

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
incentive to get users to install an ad

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,680
injector

96
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
so instead what they go to is these

97
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
middlemen these pay-per-install

98
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
basically networks

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
they're very similar to advertising

100
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,239
networks in this regard and they

101
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,000
basically say i will pay you in order to

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
distribute my software

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,239
but it turns out this these ppi networks

104
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,920
these middlemen don't actually have any

105
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
distribution arm of their own

106
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
they in turn reach out to affiliate

107
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,519
publishers people who have popular

108
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,159
software or popular websites or

109
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,519
advertisements

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,959
where they already have user traffic

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,480
coming to them and they can convert

112
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
those installs or those website visits

113
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,599
into money and so they say hey publisher

114
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,959
if you just bundle these several

115
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,640
additional applications with your

116
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
install process we'll pay you out for

117
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,959
each successful install and in return

118
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
the ppi network keeps a little bit of a

119
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
cut and the advertiser is basically

120
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
paying for all of this

121
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,640
so publishers who participate in this

122
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
market what the ppi network itself gives

123
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,360
to them is basically a bundle generator

124
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,519
so if you have a popular application or

125
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,959
maybe you just want to redistribute

126
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
chrome inside a bundle they basically

127
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
provide an upload functionality you go

128
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
to their website you say submit an exe

129
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
maybe give a thank you page and they

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,279
automatically rewrap it in this

131
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
technology that will add advertisement

132
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
offers to it

133
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
and the control for the publisher is

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
actually fairly limited you get to

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
select maybe that there's going to be

136
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
one offer and maybe five offers but what

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
actually gets bundled with your software

138
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
is up to the ppi network and basically

139
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
ad optimization

140
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
so what this leads to is this very

141
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
decentralized distribution environment

142
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
that is somewhat ripe for abuse

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,479
so if you have well-behaving publishers

144
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,080
even people who are legitimately wanting

145
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,479
to particip excuse me participate in

146
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
this network um they have no knowledge

147
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
of which advertisers they're going to be

148
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
distributing it could be ad injectors or

149
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
it could be something benign

150
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
likewise if you have legitimate

151
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,560
advertisers who are just trying to like

152
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
have real terms of condition or terms of

153
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
service uh it could be you know

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,919
publishers are actually distributing

155
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,160
their software through video codec

156
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
trickery or things like that

157
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,639
so it's very hard for any one person in

158
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
this market to kind of police abuse

159
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
and likewise if any single one

160
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,280
participant in this entire chain acts

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,120
abusively that leads to an unwanted

162
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,479
software download where there wasn't

163
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,599
proper user consent

164
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
so for our project what we wanted to do

165
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
is actually get an inside perspective of

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
how these markets are operating and who

167
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
are the participants inside of that and

168
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
so we built out a lot of infrastructure

169
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
to actually track what was going on

170
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,840
inside the

171
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,199
ecosystem to start we had to figure out

172
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
who are the ppi marketplaces that are

173
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,720
out there like who are these like

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
anomalous entities

175
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
and it turns out you can actually get a

176
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
lot of conversations about paper install

177
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,320
on underground forums

178
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,479
and the reason for that is that anybody

179
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
can sign up as a publisher so you can

180
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
have both benign entities and hostile

181
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
entities that are participating in this

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
marketplace and so you'll find lots of

183
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,039
conversations about deceptive tactics as

184
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
well as who offers the best conversion

185
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
rate who actually pays for installs on

186
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
time and all sorts of things like that

187
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
so based on looking at underground

188
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
forums you're able to identify about 50

189
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,160
different ppi networks that are in

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
operation

191
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,440
and based on some telemetry from safe

192
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,720
browsing about which ones were having

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
the most impact on users at that time we

194
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,199
selected four to study in depth

195
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
outbrows open candy a monetize and

196
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
install monetizer

197
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
some of these are located in the us

198
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,039
israel and

199
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,360
many of the others are located in russia

200
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
but the important thing to note is these

201
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
are real commercial businesses

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,199
often they're publicly traded or they're

203
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,400
startups

204
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
so they have real money behind them they

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,120
operate out in the clear

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,639
the other interesting thing about all

207
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,080
these different ppi networks is that

208
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
they often advertise all their pricing

209
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,160
information to try to attack attract

210
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
affiliates to join the marketplace so

211
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,919
you know the price for an install for

212
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
one market maybe 91 cents and another

213
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
it's two dollars and another maybe it's

214
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
70 cents so we did is actually on a

215
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,039
regular basis we'd go and crawl all of

216
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,479
the pricing data that was available

217
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
within this market so we could actually

218
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,479
track trends about how much it costs to

219
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,080
get an install in the united states or

220
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
other countries

221
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
to actually see who's buying these

222
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
installs is a little more complicated uh

223
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,919
what we ended up doing is acquiring

224
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
samples for each of the four ppi

225
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
networks we were interested in

226
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,880
and we basically launched them in a

227
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
sandbox environment kind of observed

228
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
what happens when the bundle launches

229
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,280
and it turns out that you know this

230
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
express install option where you get

231
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
five to ten other options

232
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
for bundling is dynamic so at the time

233
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,319
of launch they reach out to a commander

234
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
control server

235
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
and the first thing they do is provide a

236
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
fingerprint that says i'm launching on

237
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
this new system

238
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
these are its characteristics who wants

239
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
to be installed on this device in this

240
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
particular region

241
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
and the cnc will respond back with a

242
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
bunch of different potential offers

243
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
they'll display it to the user and then

244
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,120
the user may or may not consent to

245
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
actually having those installed

246
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,039
and once that's done they report back

247
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,039
successful installs and then may show

248
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
like an optional

249
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
thank you screen at the very end which

250
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,400
is usually you've successfully installed

251
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,759
these applications if you're interested

252
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
in even more software please visit this

253
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
website so more advertisements more

254
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
software to download

255
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
that fingerprint that gets sent back to

256
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
that commander control server usually

257
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,720
consists of about six things an ip

258
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,039
address for geolocation purposes the

259
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
browser the operating system and whether

260
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
or not administrative permissions are

261
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
available because that dictates the

262
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
level of control that whatever software

263
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,159
gets bundled

264
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,440
will have when it's installed on the

265
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
system

266
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,399
they also include things like the mac

267
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,120
address and machine id of the system um

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
to basically combat fraud so they don't

269
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,640
want people who are participating in

270
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,800
this marketplace to say oh i've

271
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
installed 100 different

272
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
bundles on this one machine so they're

273
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,959
also trying to combat abuse from

274
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,399
publishers and advertisers in the

275
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,800
network

276
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
so what we ended up doing is having

277
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,399
understood this protocol is to build

278
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,240
milkers that simulate just the first

279
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
stage we're not interested in saying

280
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,320
that we've like recuperating in cost or

281
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
incurring any fees to advertisers so we

282
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
just say we have a fresh machine it has

283
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
chrome it is internet explorer and it's

284
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
running windows 7. what are the offers

285
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
you have available for this particular

286
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,279
machine

287
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
and what you get back is usually this

288
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,519
encrypted or obfuscated blob so we had

289
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,000
to write some modules to basically uh

290
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
de-obfuscate that and what pops out is

291
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
usually a json set of instructions that

292
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,920
consists of an executable url so this is

293
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
the url you're supposed to go fetch

294
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
as a part of the offer screen

295
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
it also includes a lot of do not install

296
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
criteria so they can specify registry

297
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,440
keys and i'll get into why they do this

298
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
a little bit later but one of the

299
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
options is you don't want to install on

300
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
a system you already have paid for an

301
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
install on so it's preventing doubles

302
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
but there's some abuse that can happen

303
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,279
there too

304
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,560
and then they include things like what

305
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
are the command line parameters that can

306
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
be run which is somewhat revealing like

307
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
modify the default search and they also

308
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
do things like sleep after install

309
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,880
which specifies

310
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
don't show any of the symptoms related

311
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
to having installed this application for

312
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,279
a long time so that users who have

313
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
basically consented to the bundle

314
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
don't understand necessarily that one

315
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
week later when all of a sudden ads

316
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
start popping up all of their page

317
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,959
what was the reason that led to that

318
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
so we ran

319
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
these particular milkers

320
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
for the offers to be able to

321
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
automatically identify uh what was being

322
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
pushed through the network and we

323
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
automatically scraped the prices

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
basically every day for the course of a

325
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,720
year

326
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
and for the particular binaries that we

327
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
pulled down from the

328
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,480
ppi networks we put them into a binary

329
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,040
analysis environment looked at like what

330
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
file system changes happened what

331
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
processes were launched and different

332
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,279
things like that

333
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
we also submitted them to virustotal to

334
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
see whether or not any av

335
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
members of the industry thought that

336
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
this is unwanted software or even maybe

337
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
outright malware and the last thing we

338
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
did is some rudimentary family

339
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
clustering because if you have multiple

340
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
versions of the same advertiser software

341
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
or that same advertiser works across

342
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
multiple different ppi networks we want

343
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
to all collapse it down into one

344
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,519
particular family

345
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,279
so more details on this in the paper if

346
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,000
you actually want to go see that

347
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
so what comes out of all of this

348
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
data collection phase is that from

349
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
january of last year to january of this

350
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
year we collected over 450 000 offers

351
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
that would have been bundled uh with

352
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,680
users who were basically launching one

353
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
of these applications

354
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
and of those about 1200 were unique

355
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
and some networks are larger than others

356
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
you know open candy we only got about 77

357
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
000 and a monetize was one of the

358
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
largest we had about 230 000 different

359
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
potential offers there

360
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,760
so with this data set the question we

361
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
wanted to answer is who out there is

362
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,839
actually paying for installs are they

363
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
abusive entities or is this a legitimate

364
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,880
marketplace that you know we're

365
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,920
inappropriately disparaging potentially

366
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
um so the first thing we looked at is

367
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
the number of distinct advertisers that

368
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
are participating across each of these

369
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
individual ppi networks

370
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,000
um

371
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
overall every week we see about 160 160

372
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
different software families

373
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
participating in this marketplace

374
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
for open candy it's anywhere from about

375
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,160
you know 15 to 25 different software

376
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,639
vendors basically paying for installs

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,800
and for outbrows it's anywhere from 75

378
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,440
to about 100 different people

379
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,600
but if we look at who in particular is

380
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
distributing every single day

381
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,560
it's stories tells itself it's basically

382
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
ad injectors browsing settings hijackers

383
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,079
and pc cleanup utilities so any day of

384
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
the year when you launch one of the ppi

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
bundles that these people are

386
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,519
distributing through publishers

387
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,600
all four networks are distributing wajam

388
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
which is an ad injector

389
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
all four distribute browser fox and all

390
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,399
four distribute um what some avn

391
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,680
industry

392
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,839
players consider basically scareware

393
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
where you say here's a bunch of issues

394
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,279
with your machine 30 to 40 dollars i'll

395
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,680
fix those for you um and they're all

396
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
just bundled within this same package

397
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,839
that gets launched

398
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,920
we also see um some potentially

399
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,839
legitimate players uh participating in

400
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,440
this marketplace as well

401
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,320
so

402
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,720
in terms of antivirus we see avg toolbar

403
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,279
lavasoft commodo and kiho all basically

404
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,920
buying installs on two users machines

405
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
one thing to note is all of these av

406
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,079
industry players

407
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,000
have their own affiliate programs so you

408
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
can say go to avg and say i'll

409
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,399
distribute your software for you and for

410
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,680
subscribes

411
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
for successful subscriptions they will

412
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
pay you back so you can have basically

413
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
third parties distributing avg for on

414
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,720
abg's behalf so it's unclear whether the

415
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,079
antivirus industry is actually

416
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,000
participating in this market or third

417
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
parties that they reach out to are doing

418
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
it on their behalf

419
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
we also see some brand name software

420
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
like opera skype yahoo and aol again a

421
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
lot of these also run affiliate programs

422
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,839
so it becomes very murky whether or not

423
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,360
it's the brand name itself that's buying

424
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,000
installs or somebody else

425
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,839
so these are just the top active

426
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
entities within the market what about

427
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
the other you know 800 software families

428
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,199
that we saw

429
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
so to kind of investigate whether or not

430
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,880
they were unwanted what we did is we

431
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
looked at the virus total labels for

432
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
those particular software families

433
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,279
and so every week we flagged what

434
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
fraction of offers being distributed

435
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
through this marketplace were unwanted

436
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
and it's about 59

437
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
so on the low end open candy anywhere

438
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,120
from zero to 25 of everything that was

439
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,639
being bundled is being flagged by

440
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,399
somebody out there as being likely

441
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,639
unwanted whereas for uh install

442
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,959
monetizers anywhere from 75 percent to

443
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,240
100

444
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
so for many of these marketplaces the

445
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
core contributors people who are

446
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,440
actually buying installs all of the time

447
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
are all unwanted software developers

448
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
and as a consequence to basically some

449
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,079
av members flagging these types of

450
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,720
binaries they've gone on the defensive

451
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
so i mentioned at the very beginning

452
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
that you can specify a list of registry

453
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,839
keys that you don't want to be installed

454
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,160
alongside and so what they end up using

455
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
that for is to list all of the registry

456
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,880
keys of hostile antivirus so avast eset

457
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
and other different members of the

458
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,839
community

459
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,279
they basically say if you're going to

460
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
remove my software don't install me on

461
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,279
this machine choose some other likely

462
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,399
unwanted software bundle or advertiser

463
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,160
that isn't going to be flagged and

464
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
likewise they also flag things like

465
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,560
openvpn and vmware and virtualbox to

466
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
identify basically hostile environments

467
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,759
that they might be being installed in

468
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,399
and being introspected on

469
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,920
about 20 of the advertisers in the

470
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,360
marketplace were using this type of

471
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,839
technique

472
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
overall in terms of pricing it's

473
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,440
actually remained relatively stable

474
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
throughout time you know in the united

475
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
states it's about a dollar fifty across

476
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,639
all these different marketplaces to buy

477
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,320
and install

478
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,959
in great britain it's about 80 cents and

479
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
in other regions of the world like china

480
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,199
russia south america and africa it's as

481
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,440
low as about 10 cents

482
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,959
one thing to note is that these prices

483
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,959
are about 10x the price you can get on

484
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,199
the black market for installs and that's

485
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
because there is a consent dialogue

486
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,279
there is this veil of user consent going

487
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
on and therefore it's really hard to

488
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
basically say that this download

489
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
shouldn't have happened and as a

490
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,560
consequence you have to pay more for

491
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
this

492
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,199
so given all of our understanding about

493
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,959
how this marketplace was operating we

494
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,480
wanted to understand what impact was

495
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
this having on users as a whole

496
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
and the way we did this is we started

497
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,160
collecting all of the binaries and

498
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
identifying them i think we had about

499
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,639
1.5 million in total that we knew were

500
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
publishers belonging to this ppi

501
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
ecosystem so people would wrap their

502
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
software and we're starting to

503
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
distribute offers

504
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
and when we detect that if we know it's

505
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
a website that's doing it we'll show a

506
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
browser level interstitial that says the

507
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,480
site ahead may contain harmful programs

508
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
and likewise if we know the individual

509
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,639
download so the executable that a person

510
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,920
is grabbing

511
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
is potentially unwanted we'll show a

512
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,119
warning and that particular download

513
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,919
so

514
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,160
in terms of how many warnings we show

515
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
every particular every week over the

516
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
course of our study we're showing about

517
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
60 million user warnings related to

518
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
unwanted software downloads

519
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,760
and the gesticulation that you see is

520
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,359
the consequence of many of these

521
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
participants trying to actively evade

522
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,439
google's detection so when you see it go

523
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
down and up again it's basically an arms

524
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,520
race that's going on between detection

525
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
and some of the members of this

526
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,640
community

527
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,240
we compare that to other threats that

528
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
safe browsing tries to tackle

529
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
particularly malware we see that

530
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
unwanted software is three times more

531
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,400
likely to affect users than say drive by

532
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,880
downloads or social engineering style

533
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,200
attacks and so it's really critical to

534
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,960
understand that there are millions of

535
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,640
users out there that are encountering

536
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
this type of practice every day but we

537
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
as a community have mostly focused only

538
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
on the malware aspect of it

539
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
and

540
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
there are also a lot of individuals who

541
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
either

542
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,039
don't abide by this warning or we don't

543
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
show a warning or had existing installs

544
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,360
on their system and so to help them we

545
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
provide this chrome cleanup tool it's

546
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,400
basically

547
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
when we detect unwanted symptoms on a

548
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,919
user's machine we recommend they run

549
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,840
this particular tool and will help them

550
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
clean up unwanted software

551
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,760
and via this tool we've detected tens of

552
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,919
millions of unwanted software installs

553
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,480
so not just download attempts but actual

554
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,280
infections on a user's machine

555
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
and if we look at who are the top

556
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,080
families that we're detecting with this

557
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
tool and it's by no means comprehensive

558
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,320
so this is kind of um who are the top

559
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
players in this marketplace uh all of

560
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
the top ten are using ppi as a

561
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,679
distribution platform so there's a

562
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,480
really strong relationship between the

563
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
unwanted software that we're seeing

564
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
ending up on user systems and this paper

565
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,120
install marketplace

566
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
so the last thing i want to talk about

567
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,840
today is a little bit on the deceptive

568
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
techniques that some of these parties

569
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
are using to actually get users to

570
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,799
consent to installing

571
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,559
one of the most interesting is that some

572
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,160
of the paper install networks themselves

573
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
actually tell their publishers this is

574
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
how you can get installs on a person's

575
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,679
machine and they'll provide you

576
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,000
basically media content like here's a

577
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,720
java update here's a java error or

578
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,039
here's a utorrent client and they

579
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,120
basically provide these as drop-in

580
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
javascript blobs that you can host on

581
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,760
your website and any successful installs

582
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
you get money and the ppi network gets

583
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
money so there are ppi networks out

584
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,679
there that are actually complicit in

585
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,960
understanding that they should deceive

586
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,039
users

587
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,360
we also see like i said as a consequence

588
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,039
of basically

589
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
safe browsing and other people flagging

590
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,520
websites that are using this deceptive

591
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,360
distribution practices

592
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
resorting to techniques like domain

593
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
cycling so this is a screenshot of a

594
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
particular forum where they're basically

595
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
saying you know all of our domains got

596
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
blocked a couple of days ago make sure

597
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
to update everything that you're

598
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
sourcing from now let's your ass.com is

599
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
let share.club

600
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
and they do this now every one to seven

601
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,240
hours for most of the ppi networks so

602
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
they know they're being blocked and

603
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
rather than trying to clean up what's

604
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
going on inside the ecosystem they

605
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,120
instead turn to evasive tactics

606
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,880
and the last thing they do is try to

607
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
prevent safe browsing from

608
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,480
scanning the binaries that users are

609
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
downloading in the first place

610
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
so this is one technique that was

611
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,840
advertised on a website so when a user

612
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
clicked on a download it basically

613
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
provided you step-by-step instructions

614
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
on how to infect yourself

615
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
step one install this rar

616
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,520
step two provide the password to decrypt

617
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,799
it

618
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,559
and then as a last step basically

619
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,080
consent to the dialog

620
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
this is a defunct technique now but at

621
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
the time it was launched it basically

622
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,919
prevented safe browsing from scanning

623
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,440
the binary and alerting the user that

624
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,039
this was a likely unwanted software

625
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,840
install

626
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
so um wrapping up and i'm a little bit

627
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,159
quick

628
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,600
the takeaways that i hope that i can get

629
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,919
across today is that unwanted software

630
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,760
is this massive commercial ecosystem

631
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,679
that's out there it's affecting tens of

632
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,480
millions of users and paper install this

633
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,400
model of basically bundling software on

634
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
download portals on torrent sites

635
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
and through advertisements is the

636
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
primary distribution vector for a lot of

637
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,400
this software

638
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
and

639
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,440
while there's nothing necessarily wrong

640
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
with bundling in and of itself right now

641
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
the way the industry is organized is

642
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,919
there is a misaligned incentive between

643
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,159
advertisers and publishers publishers

644
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,480
have to focus solely on conversion rates

645
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
and advertisers have to focus on how am

646
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,480
i going to recuperate that loss fee that

647
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,159
dollar fifty i pay for an install in the

648
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,320
united states and the answer is right

649
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
now ad injection browser settings

650
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,320
hijacking and basically subscription

651
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,760
fees

652
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
and so it really takes the cooperation

653
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
across the industry and for players

654
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
within this market to try to clean up

655
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,480
what's going on so as part of this um

656
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
google's been working with the clean

657
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
software alliance which is a collection

658
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,840
of some of these different ppi networks

659
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
and some of the advertisers on trying to

660
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,720
come up with ways to actually provide

661
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
meaningful value propositions to users

662
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
that if you want to bundle software

663
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,559
here's how to do it properly and if you

664
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,720
don't then the antivirus industry in the

665
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,799
browser industry and other platforms

666
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,640
should prevent you from negatively

667
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,120
impacting users so what i hope is that

668
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,640
the rest of the research community today

669
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
also gets on board and trying to tackle

670
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,640
this problem and with that thanks

671
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,360
everybody for your time

672
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:30,960
[Applause]

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
any questions

674
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,799
i just have a quick question i noticed

675
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039
that you had a graph with all the

676
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
warnings that chrome was showing to

677
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,159
people

678
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,919
and i was just wondering why all of a

679
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
sudden you have like a big drop on all

680
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,600
the warnings especially in the month of

681
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
november i believe because you had a

682
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
graph and then all of a sudden it's just

683
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
like dropping dramatically yeah do you

684
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,919
know why those events are happening so

685
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,159
we don't have like concrete um

686
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,159
attribution of what's going on but our

687
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,880
hypothesis basically because this is

688
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,799
turning to a little bit of an arms race

689
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,360
where we deploy defenses like

690
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,039
blacklist well not blacklisting warning

691
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,720
on domains as well as warning on

692
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
binaries like i said they have that

693
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,039
domain cycling technique it may be that

694
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,559
basically they come up with a technique

695
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,559
for that short window which we don't

696
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,400
have a defense for and so they kind of

697
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
fall off our radar and then we fix it

698
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,159
and then we start warning users again so

699
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
you see this kind of trough behavior

700
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,480
thank you

701
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,039
hi william coulter i'm interested in

702
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
whether any of your research has

703
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
influenced the usability uh teams at

704
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,080
google because you know like you can go

705
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,159
to google.com and it says install this

706
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,159
toolbar and that's kind of similar to

707
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,679
some of the behavior you see on these

708
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
kinds of things or other kinds of things

709
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,760
so i'm interested in how your research

710
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
might be able to improve the design of

711
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,919
user interfaces yeah we're super

712
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,080
cognizant of basically trying to improve

713
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,919
across the board how you present

714
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,799
software install dialogues to users i

715
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,400
would call out the major difference

716
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
between say you know java bundling ask

717
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,520
toolbar is that there's a direct

718
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
relationship between the advertiser and

719
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
the publisher there and both have an

720
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,679
incentive that the user has a good user

721
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
experience whereas in this market

722
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,760
because of the ambiguity about what

723
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
software even going to be bundled

724
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
alongside like you can be an antivirus

725
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,279
toolbar and bundled alongside an ad

726
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,600
injector in this particular case

727
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
there's a lot of

728
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
less i don't know direct relationships

729
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,760
and as a consequence it's really murky

730
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
as to what's going on so you're

731
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,400
suggesting basically because uh ppi is

732
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,480
obscure that relationship they're gonna

733
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
come up with some way of

734
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,559
you know bypassing or making it look

735
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,400
like normal software anyway

736
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
you know that it's a lost cause um

737
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
i wouldn't say it's a lost cause because

738
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,679
we are trying to basically work with

739
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,760
that industry as well to come up with

740
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,840
better installed dialogues but at the

741
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,279
current iteration that we're at right

742
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,000
now um there's really no incentive for

743
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,960
advertisers to like behave very properly

744
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
because they can get installed no matter

745
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
what uh publishers want there's no way

746
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
to respect the publisher's wishes

747
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,760
whereas with direct distribution

748
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
agreements uh you can basically go and

749
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
say i don't abide by the practices that

750
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
you're doing

751
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
thanks

752
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,360
hello uh jose fernandez with polytechnic

753
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,279
marian um

754
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,520
how

755
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,279
how much coverage you think you got in

756
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,840
terms of the

757
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,200
the ecosystem of

758
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,880
um

759
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,080
the

760
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
the number of ppi essentially the

761
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
principal networks

762
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
um and also you you in terms of the the

763
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
samples how confident you are that you

764
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,520
got a

765
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
a good

766
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
qualitative coverage of of the whole

767
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,559
ecosystem yeah that's a great question

768
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,039
so we did a deep dive in four particular

769
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,919
networks because we knew um based on

770
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,520
some telomere data they were some of the

771
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,640
largest

772
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,679
we don't make any claim with the

773
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
research that it's totally comprehensive

774
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,200
of all ppi marketplaces that are out

775
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,640
there and i'd recommend you actually

776
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
come to the next talk where they do some

777
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,480
other investigation in this particular

778
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
area because um you know our approach

779
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
was very deep and the next talk is going

780
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
to go very wide with all the different

781
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
ppi networks but less attribution

782
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,360
possible there

783
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,720
okay so while our next speaker sets up i

784
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,400
have a another quick question one last

785
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
question actually

786
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,520
uh sorry

787
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
this is danny huang from uc san diego

788
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
that's a little question about the price

789
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,880
of a ppi so i noticed that

790
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
um the pl the price for pbi has been

791
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
flat for most countries except a few

792
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,919
jumps and given that this is an arms

793
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,200
race and google has been you know

794
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
tackling this problem

795
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
would one you know be expecting that the

796
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,760
price would fluctuate given what google

797
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,679
is trying to you know suppress some of

798
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
the unwanted software right um so on the

799
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,120
one hand you would think the price

800
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
should go up because basically installs

801
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,559
are becoming harder and harder to come

802
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,600
by

803
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
i think the answer is

804
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,159
complicated uh i don't have the the

805
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,400
precise answer that you want

806
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
we have seen networks basically shutting

807
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
down as a consequence of the actions

808
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,320
that are going on within the community

809
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,600
as a whole and not just that google is

810
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
doing um so some ppi networks are

811
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
basically feeling the pressure of you

812
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
know we can't just distribute unwanted

813
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,120
software we're being blocked this is no

814
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
longer a profitable industry

815
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,279
so why the price graft remains flat i

816
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
can't actually answer but we are having

817
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,399
a positive impact as a whole i would say

818
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,520
still okay thank you

819
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,440
all right yeah

820
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,320
just

821
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,600
one last quick question if

822
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
uh

823
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
well

824
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
i was just wondering so have you ever

825
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,399
seen some like uh nasty malware like

826
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,320
getting delivered through these ppi

827
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
networks like say some ram somewhere or

828
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,799
whatever yeah so there was an article i

829
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,039
think about a year ago about one ppi

830
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,320
network in particular that was

831
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
distributing malware i think the reason

832
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,720
you don't see a lot more of it is that

833
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,279
within the black market ppi networks uh

834
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,240
installs are like 10x cheaper so why

835
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,000
bother with consent dialogues when you

836
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,880
can just get installs on your machine

837
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
you know unless the price were to drop

838
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,240
dramatically i don't foresee a lot of

839
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,159
malware authors participating

840
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,760
