1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
hi i'm sergey welcome to the last talk

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
of this session so this is joint work

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
with dominic sherman

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
jasmine sascha and matthew and

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,359
yeah what we did in this paper is

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
we did a short

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,480
online study

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
about the different textual fingerprint

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,760
representations so let me start with a

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,840
quote so

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,600
there was a

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
short journal paper

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,840
with some

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
evidence that users don't uh verify ssh

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
keys so the title is do users verify ssh

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
keys and the abstract is just consisting

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
no and that's it so but there was no

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,879
study behind it and also it was

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,079
anecdotal evidence

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
so in the top right corner you see like

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,439
an example fingerprint of ssh and when

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,799
users

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
connect to a server they should verify

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,920
whether they connected to the right

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,360
server and it is often claimed that

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,759
yeah those are not checked and also

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,479
error-prone because if we create like

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,360
partial pre-images where most of the

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,640
characters uh are the same but a few are

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,520
different

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,400
uh the users wouldn't even notice and

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,600
also

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,799
most of them are um yeah it's also like

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,200
for the user it's a cognitive load it's

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
hard to compare

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,479
and many people are

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
saying like

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,240
it's like meaningless comparison of

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,439
characters

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
so that's why users are not even

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,040
motivated

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
but somehow this is still relevant

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,399
because

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,360
most of the messengers which implement

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
like end-to-end security like signal or

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
whatsapp they still rely on rely on this

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
technique because if we don't have aca

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
infrastructure

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
if we don't uh cannot implement a

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,080
transparency directory um there is no

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
other way uh to do

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
the verification so somehow we have to

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,319
do it

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
so that's why we think that it is still

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
relevant so our goal is

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
um yeah to study which of those textual

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
representations are best we are just

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
testing the textual representations

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
because um

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
yeah

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,319
you uh could perhaps get a business card

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,599
with someone's pgp key on it or

63
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,599
uh yeah your device

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
your device is not supporting um

65
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,840
qr codes and so on yeah so um yeah the

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
the best fingerprint representation

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
uh would like uh produce a high attack

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,800
uh detection so if we if the user is

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
exposed to

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
partial uh pre-images uh yeah he

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,239
should detect if there are some attacks

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
going on and also without producing a

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
false positive rate for whatever reason

74
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,239
they also should be efficient the user

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,440
should compare them fast and yet have a

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,599
low cognitive load and of course we are

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,360
interested in the user perception

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
because there might be some

79
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,519
representations which are um yeah

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
efficient and um

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
also have a high attack detection but

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
the user perceives them

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
uh yeah to be hard and they also need to

84
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,120
be

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
robust that means like

86
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
if we we want to make them accessible

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
and so on

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
so what we tested in our initial um

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
studies

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
are those six approaches so we took the

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
hexadecimal which is like the state of

92
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,000
the art as the baseline because it is

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,519
used by ssh and pgp and so on and we

94
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
also compare it to base 32 because we

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
talked to some users and they couldn't

96
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
even distinguish the difference between

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
hex and base 32 because for them it was

98
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
just characters and numbers

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
we also compared this to a numeric

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,479
approach just where you have simple

101
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
numbers from 0 to

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,639
8

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
100

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
and so on so depending on which length

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
you choose um yeah then there is also

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
the pgp word list which was developed

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
by

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
phil zimmerman

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
who

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,919
wanted to use this comparisons by a

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,800
phone

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
and chose 512 different words and each

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
uh yeah so the fingerprint is matched on

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
the word list so

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
and as you can see there are also the

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
examples how the word list looks like

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,080
except of that it consists of 16 words

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
rather than four and all the

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
fingerprints are longer this is just to

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
show how they look like

121
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,560
um but there is also the perio word list

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,080
which consists like

123
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,639
about 16 000

124
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,720
different words so it's a huge

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
dictionary which was

126
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
derived from the most common words and

127
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
movie subtitles uh

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
yeah minus offensive words and so on

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,120
and uh there is there are also different

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,600
sentence generators uh

131
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,479
we took one example which is

132
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,360
described in more detail in the paper

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,440
which produces grammatically correct

134
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,880
sentences

135
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
but semantically they just don't make

136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,199
sense so as

137
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
in this example

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,680
yes so our threat model uh how we

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
produced or uh did the pre-image attack

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,520
so in an so the ideal attack would be

141
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,720
for an existing key fingerprint we find

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
a pre-image and yeah this is

143
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
mostly not possible for most of the

144
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,759
hashing algorithm because it would be

145
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,000
very too expensive but also like

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
infeasible uh if it's long enough

147
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
and yeah there are workers rounds so we

148
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,400
generate a partial pre-image so the

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
fingerprints almost match except of a

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,800
few characters and this would exploit uh

151
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
people's attention limitations so we

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
assume that the

153
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,680
people wouldn't check it uh

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,479
like

155
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
fully concentrated

156
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
so and here we have to choose like the

157
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
attack our strengths and uh yeah we have

158
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
a few assumptions so the fingerprint is

159
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,080
derived from

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
the actual public key which is used in

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
some metadata like the creation date

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,639
like it is the case in open pgp

163
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,520
so

164
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,479
this is why we don't have to generate

165
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,120
a new key every time

166
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
it's just enough to change parts of the

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
metadata

168
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
like the creation date which is also

169
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
part of the fingerprint would

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
uh yeah we would increase

171
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,000
the time and so on so in this case we

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,560
just uh assume that this hashing

173
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
algorithm needs to be performed

174
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,720
and uh also uh with some key stretching

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
techniques we could make also the

176
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
fingerprint a bit shorter so if we would

177
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
take a 160

178
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
bit uh

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,639
um

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
fingerprint and use s-crypt on it like

181
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
and then truncate it to 112-bit

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
the users would get a shorter

183
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
fingerprints and our attacker is

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,680
controlling 80 of those 100 uh

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,479
112 bits so that basically means 80 bits

186
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
are the same

187
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,919
which is still a high cost to

188
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
generate those partial pre-images but

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,199
it's not impossible

190
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,960
um

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
yeah so uh when we do those attacks we

192
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
basically have controlled and

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
uncontrolled bits and the bits which are

194
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
uncontrolled are just

195
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,120
inverted so in this case we don't even

196
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,199
try to find uh

197
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,919
the

198
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
key or to find the correct key with the

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
fingerprint we just take the fingerprint

200
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
and change a few bits which where we

201
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
just simulate the attack

202
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,240
and uh yeah the inversions are taking

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
place only within logical sequences so

204
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,360
uh if we

205
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,039
have um a an alpha numeric approach we

206
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
just change a few characters or if we

207
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
have a word approach we change all the

208
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
bits inside of words like to maximize uh

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
the control uh

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,839
character so uh yeah uh this would be an

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
example like for the hex approach where

212
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
uh yeah we

213
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,880
changed eight characters uh

214
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
so

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
the study design

216
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,240
was then done on mturk and this was done

217
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
like with a controlled experiment where

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
the user had to perform a task and to

219
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,040
test those fingerprint algorithms and

220
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,839
then we this was followed by a survey

221
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
where we asked the user for

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
usability feedback what he thinks about

223
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
those approaches and so on

224
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
and yeah so the main task is basically

225
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
users have to compare fingerprints and

226
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
they just get two fingerprints and say

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
whether they match or don't match and

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,120
after performing all the tasks uh yeah

229
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
they are asked

230
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
or asked to fill in the survey where we

231
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,920
ask usability questions and get some

232
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,760
more feedback and before actually

233
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
starting with a real study we

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,880
started a few pre-studies

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
to find out which parameters which

236
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
approaches we take

237
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
and in the end we came up with the

238
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
factorial design where we tested four

239
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,720
different schemes

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,760
um

241
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
with schemes it's mean like uh hex and

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
base 32 are both alphanumeric and in our

243
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
pre-study we found out that the users

244
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,560
couldn't distinguish between hex or base

245
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,680
32 or whatever that's why they either

246
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,800
got hex or base 32 but never had to

247
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
perform both uh and then when we asked

248
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,920
in the survey yeah they didn't have to

249
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,680
distinguish between those approaches but

250
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,399
they also had to do the numeric and also

251
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
for the wordless approaches they

252
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
sometimes didn't even notice that some

253
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
were

254
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,600
generated words were or the amount of

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
words was shorter than in the other

256
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
approach

257
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
and yeah the generated sentences that

258
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
means that each user had to do a test

259
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
like for one alphanumeric approach for

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,640
one numeric

261
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
one wordless approach and uh yeah the

262
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
sentence approach

263
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
so

264
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,480
during that task they just

265
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
got a web page where they had a phone on

266
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,079
the left

267
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,440
showing

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
the fingerprints and a

269
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,640
business card on the right which is the

270
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
case with pgp sometimes and they just

271
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
have to check whether the security code

272
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
is the same on the left as on the right

273
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and just simply say whether it matches

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,399
or doesn't match and yeah simply click

275
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
on the buttons in the phone

276
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,839
so

277
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,839
more details about

278
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,720
our study design is so

279
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
they basically had to do 40 comparisons

280
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
which were

281
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
were counted in our case in a randomized

282
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
order so they could get hex or the other

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
approach at the beginning and just had

284
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,399
to do 40

285
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
approaches and this randomized order is

286
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,760
like

287
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
minimizing the fatigue and learning

288
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,720
effects

289
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
and for each of the schemes we do

290
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,959
exactly one attack with those 80

291
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,959
where the attacker is controlling 80

292
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,480
bits so

293
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,279
and also we found out in our pre-study

294
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,880
that if we attack like every second time

295
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,760
the users uh notice it quite well and

296
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
the accuracy is getting better and

297
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
that's why we would need more

298
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
participants that

299
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
that's why we just do one attack per

300
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
approach

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
we also added a few two attention tests

302
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
with obvious mismatches so we show on

303
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,959
the left like

304
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
just zero and on the right we show words

305
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,600
which is obviously wrong and

306
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
users who are clicking on match on that

307
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,639
uh yeah they

308
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
fail uh fail the attention test and are

309
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
excluded from the

310
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
statistics

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,040
and we also provided a few training sets

312
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
for each scheme so before actually

313
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
starting the study we show how they have

314
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
to do and we added those training sets

315
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
that's based on the feedback that uh in

316
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
the pre-studies some people were

317
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
starting to search

318
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
for typos

319
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,399
in words and we're not sure and we said

320
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
during the training sets that they don't

321
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
have to search for typos and the words

322
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
um yeah but those training sets were not

323
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
considered in the results how long they

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,240
took to click

325
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,079
so after that

326
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,320
the users got a survey

327
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
where we asked for some demographics and

328
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
uh to rate the schemes and they were

329
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,560
asked several questions something like

330
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
whether the comparisons with this method

331
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,199
were easy and then they had to rate it

332
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
for each of the approaches where we

333
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,399
remind them by showing it

334
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
in the brackets um

335
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,839
how it looks like

336
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,800
so uh the challenges we had during the

337
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,079
study is

338
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,839
that we required a high number of

339
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
participants uh and would need a lot of

340
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,600
money because we found out that

341
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
the users are quite well in comparing

342
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,639
things and most of the users on mturk

343
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
actually did a good job in comparing it

344
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
so

345
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
and there were not that

346
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,360
big differences between the approaches

347
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,320
and also we could not test each possible

348
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
parameter so

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
uh some of the approaches could use

350
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
different chunk sizes or different

351
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,360
colors or different font settings

352
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,440
and uh yeah it would

353
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
cost too much money as such study would

354
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
cost too much money to test all the

355
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
different uh

356
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
parameters so

357
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
we added an additional experiment where

358
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
we just tested the chunking but the same

359
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
could be done with different font

360
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
settings and so on so we used the same

361
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,800
font settings and the same chunking

362
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
approaches for all

363
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,240
of the

364
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
approaches so

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,839
our results were

366
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
in the end like we had 1047 participants

367
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
who

368
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
were participating in this study and 46

369
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
were excluded because they just randomly

370
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,680
clicked somewhere and

371
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,320
yeah failed the attention tests

372
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
uh it was in general a mixed demographic

373
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
so there was a similar amount of males

374
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,240
and females and uh yeah

375
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
uh the thing

376
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,320
in the demographics has shown that there

377
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,399
is no real difference based on age

378
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,519
gender or education so it was quite

379
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,120
similar and uh yeah as i said there is a

380
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,160
relatively high attack detection rate

381
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,839
for our chosen attacker for all schemes

382
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,399
so in the experiment results we see the

383
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,160
speed in seconds

384
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,519
as you can see

385
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,920
the best approach and the worst approach

386
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,639
are not that far away

387
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,360
in the median

388
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,880
and

389
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
the more important uh column in this

390
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,600
case is the undetected attacks so how

391
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,079
many attacks were performed successfully

392
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,399
and as you can see here hexadecimal

393
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
which is like the state of the arc had

394
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,120
uh yeah

395
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,399
ten percent

396
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,839
undetected

397
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,759
attacks so of all attacks happened ten

398
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,079
percent were not detected if we compare

399
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,160
it to the language-based approaches like

400
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,279
sentences or the period list which are

401
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,480
uh lower and the period list was the

402
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,639
fastest to compare this is based on the

403
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
fact that they had a large uh dictionary

404
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,120
and the user said just to read nine

405
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,199
words and yeah

406
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
um then

407
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
there is also a false positive

408
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,920
column and here we see like a different

409
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
number in the sentences

410
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
that's because

411
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,240
the phone was in the vertical uh

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
not landscape

413
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,680
so the phone was vertical and the

414
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,199
business card uh was landscape and uh

415
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
yeah there were different alignments for

416
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,639
some sentences which were longer and

417
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
that's when the users clicked oh it's

418
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
wrong even though the sentences were

419
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
exactly the same i don't have an

420
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,839
explanation why base 32

421
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,559
produced more false positives than any

422
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,000
other approaches

423
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
even though o and zero uh are not inside

424
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
so there is no o and no i to avoid a

425
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,839
confusion between

426
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,679
uh o and zero and one and i

427
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,880
um

428
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
yeah uh in the chunking experiments uh

429
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
yeah we tested the different chunking

430
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
approaches and uh yeah we didn't get any

431
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,480
uh significant numbers so even though

432
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,280
there are small differences uh in

433
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,679
undetected attacks those are not

434
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,600
significant the only thing which is

435
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,919
significant is the speed but it's uh

436
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,120
quite similar for all chunkings so hex2

437
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
means like in two characters like it is

438
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
done in ssh hex three and three

439
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,559
characters x4 and so on

440
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,559
um

441
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
yeah as you can see

442
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,720
there is not too much difference uh

443
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
in here and in the survey results at the

444
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
end we asked them a few questions about

445
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,559
the trustworthiness that was like do you

446
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,799
believe a such system is secure and

447
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,840
unsuper unsurprisingly uh the hex and

448
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,720
the base 32 because it looks like very

449
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
random most of the people said they

450
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,280
believe it's more secure compared to

451
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,679
generated sentences even though

452
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,960
those

453
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,919
are

454
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,760
the security is the same

455
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,640
and regarding the usability the language

456
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
based approach uh

457
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
the better rating but here as you can

458
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
see the differences are not that far

459
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
away

460
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,440
we got a general feedback that most of

461
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
the users

462
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,679
were annoyed to do this task with any of

463
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
the fingerprints so even though they

464
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
like the generated sentences more

465
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
they still

466
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
would rather skip it

467
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
and yeah the limitations

468
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,600
are like um yeah as i said there is no

469
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
guarantee that the easiest approach will

470
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,280
still lead that the users will actually

471
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
do the fingerprints and also there are

472
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,440
uh some validity questions about mturik

473
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
as with any emters studies

474
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,679
because the

475
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,360
people have more experience or

476
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
are more technical persons compared to

477
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,679
the average population and is also

478
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,960
younger

479
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
and

480
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
is in general used to visual and textual

481
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,039
tasks so because they do it

482
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,760
a lot of tasks like this

483
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,640
yeah

484
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
and

485
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
uh yeah as i said we didn't test all the

486
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
different parameters uh because

487
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
otherwise we would have too many

488
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,080
conditions to test and this would be too

489
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
expensive

490
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
so

491
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,360
to conclude my talk um yeah as we can

492
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,559
see the

493
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,640
hexadecimal approach even though it is

494
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,039
the state of the art has shown the worst

495
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
performance of all approaches uh it has

496
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
a lower attack detection rate is also

497
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
slower than most of the other approaches

498
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
and is perceived to be more annoying by

499
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,960
most of the users and the generated

500
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,159
sentences produce the best result

501
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,640
because yeah they have the highest

502
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,440
attack

503
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,799
detection rate

504
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,600
and the users perceive it to be more

505
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,640
usable

506
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,679
and numeric was the best approach

507
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,240
without the language-based systems so in

508
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,880
that case whatsapp

509
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,039
the right choice uh in their

510
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
implementation actually we didn't know

511
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
that

512
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,520
whatsapp will actually implement it so

513
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,159
when we submitted the paper this was a

514
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
few weeks earlier than

515
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
the announcement of whatsapp that they

516
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,200
are using this fingerprint methods

517
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
so

518
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
yeah

519
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,159
that's it and yeah i'm happy to answer

520
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,720
your questions

521
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,740
[Applause]

522
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,720
we have time for questions

523
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,600
thank you for your talk a brief question

524
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
on open ssh keys

525
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,720
uh there is this option that you can

526
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
activate that will show you a sort of

527
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
graph ascii graphics yeah when you're

528
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,400
logging into an ssh server you didn't

529
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,360
look into this like why and really just

530
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,000
the textual approaches oh yeah i already

531
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
forgot the title of the target so the

532
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
thing is that um

533
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,799
yeah it is first of all harder to

534
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,799
generate like

535
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,080
the attacks on this um yes

536
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,200
visual fingerprints and second of all uh

537
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,799
yeah there are people with visual

538
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,679
impairment which probably cannot see

539
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
this uh

540
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,679
ascii art thing that's why we said we

541
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,280
are just focusing on the textual

542
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
approaches and the textual approaches

543
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
are also more robust in that sense that

544
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,760
you can compare them via phone and so on

545
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
thank you

546
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
hi uh tabeshwar there from georgetown i

547
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
just had a quick question about the

548
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
amtrak so you showed a screenshot of the

549
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,600
study so was the phone image rendered or

550
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
was it just text on both sides because

551
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,559
if it was text oh no it was not text it

552
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
was uh rendered that they couldn't just

553
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
copy paste and do it automatically or

554
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
something okay and another quick

555
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
question so for the amtrak study usually

556
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
the aim of the people is to just more

557
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,320
tasks and get more money so did you give

558
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,200
any reward or any uh like more money to

559
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,720
the people who guessed it right so they

560
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,320
had a motivation to do the study right

561
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
instead of just clicking yes no yes no

562
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
yeah we didn't do that because in the

563
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
real world

564
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,799
people don't

565
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,880
are not motivated to do this on whatsapp

566
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,320
either so that's why we wanted to make

567
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,919
it like

568
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,559
more comparable uh

569
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,600
yeah but okay thank you

570
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
all right uh so if we don't have any

571
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,480
more questions i want to thank all the

572
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,280
speakers again from the session

573
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,678
you
