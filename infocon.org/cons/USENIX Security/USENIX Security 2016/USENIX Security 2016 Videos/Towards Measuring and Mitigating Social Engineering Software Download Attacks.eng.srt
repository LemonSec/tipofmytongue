1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,240
hello everyone hey my name is terry

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,679
nelms and i'm here to talk to you today

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,160
about measuring and mitigating social

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
engineering software download attacks

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
so modern malware typically the modern

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,320
malware infections typically occur via

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
one of two methods

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
first is the drive-by download

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,238
so in this case

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
the user has a vulnerable software in

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,440
their system typically the browser or

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
browser plug-in such as java or flash

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
and as they browse the web they come

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
across malicious code that redirects

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
them to an exploit kit

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
that results in the exploit kit using

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
the vulnerability to both download and

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,120
install

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,160
malware

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
and so this is an attack against the

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,359
software itself the other way

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
machines get infected is through social

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,479
engineering attacks and so in this case

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,880
the user is browsing the web

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
and they come across content

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
that uses deception and persuasion

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
techniques to convince the user to

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,360
voluntarily download and install the

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
malware so in this case it's an attack

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
against the user and not the software

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,799
an example of a social engineering

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
attack is fake av

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,000
so in a fake a v attack the user is

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,079
typically browsing the web they come

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,560
across a malicious advertisement that

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
tells them that their machine is

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,159
infected with malware and that they need

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
to download and install on this tool to

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
remove it

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,320
however when they download and install

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,079
this tool they're actually installing

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
malware not actually installing

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,960
a tool to remove malware

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,240
and so uh

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,320
so there's been a lot of work uh around

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
drive-by downloads and so

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,560
there's been a lot of research both on

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
ways to detect drive-by downloads and

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,200
and ways to uh

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
mitigate their impact

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
however there's been relatively little

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,720
research done

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,599
on social engineering

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
so in our research we actually do a

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
study of web-based social engineering

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
downloads and so for our study we need

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
to collect a lot of data a lot of real

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,000
world social engineering downloads

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
so we deployed a collection agent on a

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,520
large academic network for a period of

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
two months

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
and this collection agent performed real

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,519
time deep packet inspection

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
to reconstruct http transactions and we

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,840
buffered

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
these hp transactions in memory for all

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,959
the users on the network and we

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
typically had around five to ten minutes

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
worth of of hp traffic uh in in the

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
buffer and it depended basically on on

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
the uh the amount of load the network at

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
the time

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,440
and so once we observed an executable

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,319
download we basically dumped uh we

75
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
recorded both the actual executable

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,879
download itself as well as all the

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
network traffic that went to the user

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,080
that's currently downloading the

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,800
executable and when we saved that all

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,640
that traffic

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
and so

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,959
the next step

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,000
is that we we actually retraced the web

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
path and so since we had the data for

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
both the executable download as well as

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
the http transactions that that occurred

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
just prior to that download we were able

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
to reconstruct the click path followed

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
by the user and so the click path being

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
some origin

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
such as a search engine and then the

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
search engine results and then the user

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
clicking through um the results of the

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,720
search engine and then hitting the page

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
that actually had the deception

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
persuasion techniques

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
that convinced them to download the

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
executable and then finally the

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
executable download itself

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,560
so in all we collected almost 36 000

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
downloads from this network and a little

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
over two thousand of these

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
downloads were successful social

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
engineering downloads and by successful

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
i mean we actually saw the user download

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920
and executable

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
and so through extensive uh manual

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,239
analysis and the reconstruction of the

109
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
path we were able to then examine the

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,358
social engineering downloads

111
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
so today i'm going to talk to you about

112
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
on the categorization of these social

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
engineering downloads and talk about the

114
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,800
the tactics use to trick users into

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
downloading and installing

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
these these applications and then we're

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,919
going to measure

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
some properties around the downloads and

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,400
then i'll end the talk

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
with some discussion on how to detect

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
social engineering download attacks

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
so let's start with the categorization

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
system

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
and so an attacker

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
that wants to use social engineering

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
really needs to do two things

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
first they need to gain the user's

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
attention

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
and and once the user's attention has

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,759
been gained they need to convince them

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
that they want to go out and voluntarily

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
download and install the software

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
and so i'm gonna i'm gonna show some

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
examples and describe

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
the different techniques here and we'll

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,120
start with gaining the user's attention

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
so

138
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
a very common technique

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
used to gain the user's attention is an

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
advertisement and so

141
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
on the screen here is an example of an

142
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,240
advertisement used to get the user's

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
attention

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
and and so this particular user uh

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
performed a google search and and their

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280
search terms would basically

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,800
watch the latest episode of scandal

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
for free online and so in the search

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
results uh that they came across a link

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
that eventually led them

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
to this site

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,919
and so on this site this is actually the

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,280
episode of scandal that they wanted to

154
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,160
watch

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
um however um the watch in hd and

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
download now that you see overlaid on

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,039
top of the video um is actually not a

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,240
part of the video it's actually an

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,319
advertisement that has been overlaid on

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,680
top of the video

161
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
and so the user going wanting to go

162
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
watch the show ends up clicking on the

163
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
advertisement and not on the video

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,919
and they end up downloading executable

165
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
that has scandal and even the episode of

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
scandal's name

167
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
in it and it but it's a dot exe it's not

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
a video and so they end up installing

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
software that they don't want and not be

170
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,479
and not watching the scandal episode

171
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,120
they wanted to

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,039
another way

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,360
attackers get the user's attention is is

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
through search

175
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,199
so in this case

176
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,120
the user goes to a search engine and

177
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
they type firefox download

178
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
and and here are the results for the

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
firefox download

180
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,199
the the first result is the

181
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
opendownload.com

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
and the next resort is to maxilla.org

183
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,720
and of course you want to download

184
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
firefox from mozilla

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,120
but you know a lot of users in a hurry

186
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
to download the browser end up just

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,639
clicking on the first link

188
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
and it's the first link here because

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
it's actually an advertisement so the

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,960
advertisement is actually placed the

191
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,680
opendownload.com

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
link prior to mozilla and so the user

193
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
clicking on opendownload.com

194
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
goes to the website they end up getting

195
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
firefox but they also get some other

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
programs they potentially do not want

197
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
bundled with their firefox download

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
the other way attackers gain the users

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,759
attention

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
is through web posts and so in this case

201
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,919
a user's uh browsing a forum and they're

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,280
looking for

203
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
integrated chinese third edition level

204
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,319
one part one answer key

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
and they come across this post that

206
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,319
looks like it's a link for what they

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,639
want however when they click on it they

208
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,639
end up downloading executable and not a

209
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
pdf and the executable doesn't really

210
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,639
contain the answer key but contain

211
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
software again that they probably do not

212
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,360
want to install on their system

213
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
so those are the ways that social

214
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
engineer attackers gain the user's

215
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,120
attention

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
next i'll talk about like once the the

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
user's attention has been gained the

218
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,800
actual deception and persuasion

219
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
techniques the attacker then uses to

220
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,919
convince them to download and install

221
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,960
the software and we'll start with decoy

222
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,319
so in this example the user goes out

223
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,039
to a website that has cracked software

224
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
and also key generators and and they do

225
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
this search for studyminder homework

226
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
system keygen

227
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
and so if you look at the very bottom of

228
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
the screen you'll notice that there's

229
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
basically zero results from this site

230
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
for what they're looking for however

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
what's in between the search keywords

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
and the results of the site is an

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,080
advertisement a decoy advertisement and

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
the advertisement actually has the words

235
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
that they used in their search in the

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
link as well as showing download speeds

237
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
and so in this case the user clicks on

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
this advertisement and goes and

239
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
downloads the software that's not the

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
keygen that they wanted but software

241
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,279
that they do not want to install

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,720
another way

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
people

244
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
are attackers socially engineered people

245
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,320
is through repackaging and so in the

246
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,279
example i showed you before in the

247
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,640
opendownload.com where the user clicks

248
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
on the open download link

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
they end up on this site and where they

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
can so they're able to download firefox

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
from here but firefox comes bundled with

252
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,519
some additional software that they

253
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
probably don't want to install

254
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,399
another technique is impersonation

255
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,880
so in this case um the user was browsing

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
the web and they come across this

257
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,680
advertisement and this advertisement has

258
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,560
you know the java icons on it the name

259
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,519
java

260
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,839
sun micro systems and everything makes

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
it appear to be a way to download java

262
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,720
however clicking on the link to download

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
java you actually don't go to sunsite

264
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
you're not downloading java you're

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,839
you're downloading other software so

266
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,519
this is impersonation so they're making

267
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
their advertisement appear to be

268
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,800
something the user knows in this case

269
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,519
java

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
invent is another technique

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
and so in the case of an event

272
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
that the user here was browsing the web

273
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
and they're shown an advertisement

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
that's warning them that their flash

275
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
player is out of date

276
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,079
however there's no code in the

277
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,240
advertisement that checks to see

278
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
if the user really has a fl the version

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
of the flash where the user has

280
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,519
installed and so they're actually

281
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,920
inventing a scenario that the user's

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,720
flash player is is out of date and when

283
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
the user clicks on this they actually

284
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,399
don't download flash player but they end

285
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
up downloading some other software

286
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
another technique

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,440
is alarm and so alarm uses the fear of

288
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
the user to convince them to download

289
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
and install software so in this case

290
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
users browsing the web and they're shown

291
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,519
an advertisement for an ebola early

292
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,920
warning system it says are you safe from

293
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,640
ebola and so this early warning system

294
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
says it'll keep you safe by letting you

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
know when other people around you are

296
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
getting infected

297
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
and so the users scared this and so they

298
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
they click on it download it and install

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,560
it but they don't really get it get a

300
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
good uh

301
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
detection system from it

302
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
next

303
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
it is enticed and and so in this case uh

304
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,320
the user was on a web form

305
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
and and they find this this really cool

306
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
looking

307
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
minecraft x-ray mod and so but

308
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,920
by the description here it's really

309
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,399
enticing to go and download this however

310
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,880
clicking on uh the minecraft x-ray mod

311
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
link

312
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
does not result in getting this mod

313
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,079
instead it results in software that you

314
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,680
do not want to install on your system

315
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
and then lastly

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
is comply

317
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
so in the comply case the user was

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
browsing the web

319
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,800
and they when they went to watch a video

320
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
and when they went to watch the video

321
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,639
they were prompted with this ad and so

322
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,120
it says install media downloader in

323
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
order to watch videos required

324
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,000
and so the motive to motivate the user

325
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,480
right that the user has to comply with

326
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
her the user believes he has to comply

327
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
with this request in order to watch the

328
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
video that he wants

329
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,160
so those are the different um deception

330
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
persuasion techniques as well as well as

331
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
the techniques to gain the user's

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
attention that we observed in the social

333
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
engineering downloads next i'll talk

334
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
about some measurements around these

335
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,839
downloads

336
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,440
um so one

337
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
one thing to notice is is that typically

338
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,760
a social engineering attack just doesn't

339
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
use a a single tactic and so just

340
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
wouldn't use repackage they'll typically

341
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,440
use repackage plus entice um to trick

342
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,120
the user

343
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,760
and if we look at the the popularity of

344
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
these of the different combinations of

345
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
techniques um the top three are

346
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,560
responsible for almost 90 percent of the

347
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
social engineering downloads we observe

348
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
and so repackage

349
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
plus entice is number one at about 48

350
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
and a half percent

351
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
and then we have an event impersonate

352
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
alarm at 21.7 percent

353
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
and invent impersonate comply at 19.2

354
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
percent

355
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
so to give an example of repackaged

356
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
entice i'll go back to the firefox

357
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,079
download i was talking about earlier and

358
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
so we know it has a repackaged piece

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
right because you're getting firefox but

360
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,279
you're getting some additional software

361
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,959
that you may not want

362
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,360
the entire speech comes in but by this

363
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
firefox review that you have here and so

364
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
they're really attempting to tell the

365
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
user how cool firefox is why they should

366
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,839
install it as well as having the free

367
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,079
download icon and so that's that's an

368
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,040
example of a repackaged entice

369
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
social engineering attack

370
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,839
invent and personate alarm

371
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
we'll look at the fake flash example

372
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
again and so if you remember um in this

373
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,240
example the user's prompted with warning

374
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
your flash player is outdated it's in

375
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,600
it's inventing it's an event because um

376
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,199
you know the software doesn't check if

377
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,360
they if they have flash player and what

378
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
version they have it's impersonation

379
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,320
because the ads claiming to be flash

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,800
player and it's alarm because it's using

381
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
the fear of the user's flash player

382
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
being outdated and vulnerable to try to

383
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
convince them to download and install

384
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,079
the software

385
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,800
and then for invent impersonate comply

386
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,839
if we go back to that um install media

387
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,000
downloader in order to watch videos um

388
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
it's it's an invention because in this

389
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
case you don't really need to install

390
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
the media downloader to watch the video

391
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,240
in fact just closing the ad you're able

392
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
to watch the video immediately

393
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
impersonation because they're using

394
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,199
icons and colors to appear to be similar

395
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,959
to flash and pretending to be a media

396
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
player that you need to watch the video

397
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
and then lastly comply because it says

398
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
it is required in order for you to go

399
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
forward to watch the video

400
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
so if we go if we look deeper into

401
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
the invent impersonate alarm and event

402
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,839
impersonate comply

403
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,480
classes and look at the type of software

404
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
that they're using to distribute we see

405
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
that fake flash

406
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,360
is is most popular in the alarm class at

407
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
almost 70 percent of the downloads that

408
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,399
we observe for social engineering in

409
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,000
this class are telling you that your

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,160
flash player is out of date or something

411
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
about your flash player needs updating

412
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
um fake java which is very similar to

413
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
the flight flash attack

414
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,399
is next at 30 percent

415
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
however what we didn't see much of on is

416
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,920
fake av and fake av only made up about

417
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,519
one percent

418
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
of the of our observations in this class

419
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
looking at the comply side we see that a

420
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
fake player makes up about 80 percent

421
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
and so fake players telling you hey you

422
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
need to install this media player or you

423
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
need to install this codec to go and

424
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,880
watch the video

425
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,399
the other 20

426
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,880
um from the comply class was fake flash

427
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,639
and so in this case they're telling you

428
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
you need to install the latest version

429
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,399
of flash in order to watch the video

430
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
all right so if we move on then to the

431
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
popularity of the social engineering

432
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
tactics for gaining the user's attention

433
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,720
we can see that that that ads dominate

434
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,519
uh getting the user's attention and so

435
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,279
um ads alone

436
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
were responsible for almost 81 percent

437
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
of the social engineering downloads we

438
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,160
observed and then search plus ad

439
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,959
adds another 7.3 percent

440
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,160
so combined this is almost 90 percent

441
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
of the social engineering downloads we

442
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,360
observed

443
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,399
the ads basically allow the attackers to

444
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
easily publish their deception and

445
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
persuasion techniques on sites that are

446
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,399
that are um they're already popular

447
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
among the targeted victims

448
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,560
and it also limits the exposure because

449
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,399
the the the social engineering ads are

450
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
only targeted at users that use have

451
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,040
certain searches or keywords or user

452
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,439
cookies

453
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
so you may think well if so much of

454
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
these social engineering downloads are

455
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,279
ads why don't we just block any any

456
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
download that that is the result of an

457
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,799
ad chain

458
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
well the problem is is that a

459
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,039
significant percentage of the benign

460
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
downloads are also ad based and so we

461
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,400
base we found that seven percent of all

462
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
benign downloads we observe were the

463
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,400
result of an advertisement

464
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,880
and since since the benign downloads um

465
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,559
are much larger than the social

466
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
engineering

467
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
path download that that the download is

468
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
benign

469
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,799
and so the most popular categories for

470
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,640
benign downloads uh through

471
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
advertisements were in the games and

472
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
utilities and then the most popular

473
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,360
software we observed during this time

474
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
was the try on worlds game being

475
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,799
downloaded through advertisement and

476
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,039
then followed closely by spotify

477
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,760
we also looked

478
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
at the entire ad chain

479
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,320
for these social engineering downloads

480
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,160
and specifically here we're looking at

481
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,039
the top five ad entry point domains so

482
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
this is the actual first name or the

483
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,640
first domain we observe on the ad chain

484
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,880
and so what we found

485
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
is that for the comply and alarm

486
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,919
classes that the majority of downloads

487
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,080
begin with a few low tier ad networks

488
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,679
shown here these low tier ad networks

489
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,559
are known to to serve adware and malware

490
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
whereas like the benign class and even

491
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
the repac or the repackaged entice class

492
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,600
typically their advertisements are start

493
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,760
with top tier ad networks

494
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
all right so those are um the

495
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,480
measurements around the the social

496
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
engineering downloads that we observed

497
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
and now i'm going to talk a little bit

498
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,679
about detecting uh these social

499
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,160
engineering

500
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,120
shows a b downl

501
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,320
both on on day zero and on day thirty

502
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
and so day zero is the is the day the

503
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,039
the actual social engineering took place

504
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,360
and the binary was downloaded and if and

505
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
if we look at that we see an

506
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,320
event impersonate comply less than five

507
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,000
percent of the downloads were detected

508
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,400
by av on that day

509
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
um for invent and personate alarm uh

510
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,039
less than 15 percent

511
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,240
and for repackaged entice less than 25

512
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,600
percent and the av that we use we

513
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
actually submitted these to virus total

514
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,240
and use the results of the av

515
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,720
from there and see and then on day 30 um

516
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,559
almost all of them then exceed 70

517
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,400
percent for

518
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
av detection and so what this means is

519
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
that the the software being downloaded

520
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
through these social engineering attacks

521
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,360
are not being detected on day zero by by

522
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,559
av

523
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
and so we looked at um building a

524
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,840
classifier that could then um detect

525
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,160
these social engineering downloads and

526
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,080
so we came up with two separate classes

527
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
of features

528
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
the first class are ad chain features

529
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,559
and the other one is download url

530
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,840
features

531
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
from the ad chain the first thing we

532
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,000
looked at is is is this ad driven and so

533
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
is there an ad on the web path itself

534
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
that led to the download and so it's a

535
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
boolean feature and the intuition here

536
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
is that only seven percent of the benign

537
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,600
downloads had ads whereas almost 90

538
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
of the social engineering downloads had

539
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
ads

540
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
we also looked at minimum ad domain age

541
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,600
and so we looked at all the domains on

542
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,320
the ad path and we measured and we found

543
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
the one that had the youngest age and

544
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,400
use it as as a feature and the reason

545
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
behind that is because the ads that that

546
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,039
serve on malicious software tend to be

547
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,760
blacklisted and so they're replaced with

548
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
young domains

549
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
we also looked at maximum ad domain

550
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
popularity

551
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
this feature

552
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
looks at our historical classifications

553
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
for both social engineering downloads as

554
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
well as benign downloads and

555
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,840
and and finds like the max the

556
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
popularity of the ad in those classes

557
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
and uses that as a feature and and the

558
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
idea here being

559
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
as i showed you before there's often a

560
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
small number of low tier ad networks

561
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,360
that are responsible for the majority of

562
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,440
social engineering downloads

563
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
and then moving on to the download url

564
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
features

565
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
we looked at

566
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
download domain agents so this is the

567
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
age of the download domain itself and

568
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,559
these also tend to be young if they're

569
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,080
serving

570
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,919
malicious files because they they get

571
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,520
blacklisted and they have to rotate out

572
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
domains

573
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,559
and we also looked at we also used

574
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
download domain alexa rank and so we

575
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,919
found is that over 60 percent of the

576
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,960
benign downloads came from uh elec had

577
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,280
alexa rankings of less than hundred

578
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
thousand whereas social engine the

579
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
majority of social engineering downloads

580
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
the the domain rank was above one

581
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
million

582
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,679
so we use those features um to build a

583
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,120
classifier

584
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,600
and we trained the classifier over the

585
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,039
two months of study data that we had

586
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,760
and then we we we predicted across two

587
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,159
months of data that we collected um

588
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,240
after our study and our classifiers

589
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,200
designed to do to be deployed in real

590
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
time and be able to make classification

591
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,919
predictions as executables were being

592
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,120
downloaded

593
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,360
and so what we found is our classifier

594
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
has a true positive rate of just over 91

595
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,679
with a false positive rate of half a

596
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,159
percent

597
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
all right so

598
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,240
so in conclusion

599
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
i i discussed our classification system

600
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
and how attackers gain the user's

601
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,799
attention and then the deception and

602
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
persuasion techniques they they use to

603
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,200
get the user to download and install

604
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
malicious software and i gave some

605
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,280
examples of each of these

606
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
and then we looked at measurements to

607
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,320
see the popularity of the different

608
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
techniques and we also looked we also

609
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,919
performed some measurements that would

610
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,440
allow us to

611
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
detect attacks in the future

612
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,159
and then um i we we designed a

613
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,880
classifier and we showed the accuracy of

614
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,840
this classifier at detecting attacks

615
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,520
such as this fake flash download shown

616
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,760
here

617
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
and with that i conclude my presentation

618
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,250
and please if you have questions ask

619
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:24,490
[Applause]

620
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,280
questions

621
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
hi and thank you for that insightful

622
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,280
research however i have some criticism

623
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
okay um you scan basically a whole

624
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
university network for a longer period

625
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,039
of time

626
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,400
and

627
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
some of the examples you explained are

628
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,320
at least borderline illegal

629
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,120
so

630
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
um did you consult an irb or an ethics

631
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
and research committee

632
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,320
and what did you do to preserve the

633
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,520
privacy and protect the privacy of your

634
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
participants

635
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,520
yeah so so we did go through an irb

636
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,799
approval process uh for this and yeah we

637
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
we kept these files on the server that

638
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,440
they were collected and they were

639
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,360
encrypted and protected and so no one no

640
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
one could really have access to it

641
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,799
okay

642
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,840
but

643
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
but you didn't clean any metadata or

644
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,799
something

645
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,200
um so yeah so so we'd remove cookies and

646
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
things like that that that that would be

647
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,120
you know that that would have the

648
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,600
typical data that would be you know

649
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,679
important to a user that would have pii

650
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,080
type information okay thanks yeah

651
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
algus reduce google sorry i'm if i

652
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,520
missed this early on

653
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,320
but

654
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,679
how did you identify given a binary

655
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,120
because as i recall you basically

656
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
started with set of binaries and you

657
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
decided that some subset of them were

658
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
malicious did you have some

659
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
prior classification of whether a binary

660
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,039
was malicious to see whether you needed

661
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,960
to track packets

662
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
well no so i mean we go into details in

663
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,760
this in the paper but we but basically

664
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,840
um we end up reconstructing the web path

665
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,159
of everything you know and then we have

666
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
some heuristics that allow us to remove

667
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,200
things fairly easily like updates

668
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,360
for example and then for the set that

669
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,760
remains we did extensive manual analysis

670
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
where we actually looked to see is the

671
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
drive by download or if it was social

672
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,720
engineering by actually looking at you

673
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
know what what the user clicked through

674
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
to eventually download the executable

675
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
but but the full details are

676
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,639
in the paper thanks

677
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,520
so i was wondering so did you

678
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
study how effective these different

679
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,400
tactics that uh

680
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
you know the software developers are

681
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,760
using are in attracting victims whether

682
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,679
for example an alarm is more effective

683
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,520
than uh

684
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,120
whatever a compliance message or

685
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
something like that yeah i mean so i

686
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,840
mean that that basically goes to the

687
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,080
popularity um that you know that

688
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
that i showed during the presentation um

689
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,159
that uh

690
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,880
repackaged entities is most popular

691
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,960
and then person eight alarm is next

692
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,520
followed by invent impersonate comply

693
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,039
and so that's the popularity of the

694
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,360
techniques that that that we observe but

695
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
but these but what we have to remember

696
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,720
though is all these are are successful

697
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,799
social engineering right because that

698
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,240
they click i didn't have i didn't have

699
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
the cases where they were they didn't

700
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,240
click on the executable okay download so

701
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,200
yeah

702
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,720
okay

703
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,400
related to that i was wondering if you

704
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,960
looked at cases where

705
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,840
um

706
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,000
any cases where the sort of the the

707
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
download you know the the ad was shown

708
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,600
to people and i guess you didn't know

709
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
when

710
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,039
your data set didn't have situations

711
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,640
where like they got a warning or

712
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,480
anything like that whether there was any

713
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
mechanisms that

714
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,320
sort of prevented these things

715
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
yeah yeah so i didn't know if they were

716
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
running software or anything that

717
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
actually gave them a warning on the

718
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,159
symptom i was only i only had visibility

719
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,840
at the network level and so if a warning

720
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
went across the network then i could see

721
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
i could see that but i couldn't see if

722
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,960
they had local software installed if

723
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,559
they got a warning not not to click on

724
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,720
the link or or not but i didn't i didn't

725
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
observe any over the network you know

726
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,679
telling them not right because i mean i

727
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,000
i see people kind of it's i feel like

728
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
this is sort of an it's it's it's not an

729
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,080
indictment of the user it's indictment

730
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,880
of us right like that this is that this

731
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,720
happens because it's totally in most of

732
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
these cases it's totally reasonable

733
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
things for users to be doing i agree so

734
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,120
well thank you
