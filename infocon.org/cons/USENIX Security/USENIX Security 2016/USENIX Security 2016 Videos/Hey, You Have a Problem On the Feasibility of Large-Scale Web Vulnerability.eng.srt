00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,400
hi everyone my name is ben i'm a postdoc

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
at the center for it security privacy

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,480
and accountability of assault sispa of

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
startup university

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,439
and i'm really happy today to present to

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,720
you joint work with my co-authors

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,199
giancarlo christian martin and michael

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
on the feasibility of web vulnerability

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,560
notifications

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,160
so the motivation for our work is

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
somewhat twofold so on the one hand side

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
previous years have shown that widely

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
used content management systems such as

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
for example drupal or joomla have had

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
really critical vulnerabilities which

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,440
were exploited at scale within a number

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,559
of hours um on the other side the

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
research community including actually

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
ourselves as well as adam doing the

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,399
execute of the redirect flaws

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,719
have discovered ways of finding these

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,480
vulnerabilities or finding different

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,559
types of vulnerabilities

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
at scale in web applications however

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,559
while we as a community have become

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
really good at finding these bugs um we

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
have not really focused that much on

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
notifying the affected parties about the

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
problem and this is exactly where our

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,479
work wants to come in and try to

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
understand how notifications can work at

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,680
scale

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
and have a look at what potentially

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,360
suitable communication channels might be

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
to do this at scale

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
how such a campaign can influence the

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
prevalence of vulnerabilities on the web

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
um and if it doesn't work try to also

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,600
find out what inhibiting factors might

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
be

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,000
so to answer this question we set up a

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
study um for the study we used two types

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
of vulnerabilities so on the one hand

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,680
side we used vulnerabilities in

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
wordpress and we chose wordpress because

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
it powers about 25 of the top million

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
websites so obviously it's the most

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
widely used content management system

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,200
next to two cross-site scripting

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
vulnerabilities we selected what is

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
called the xml rpc multi-call flaw this

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
is basically

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,560
a vulnerability that allows an attacker

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,960
in a single http request to brute force

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,399
a large number of username password

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,560
combinations thereby basically bypassing

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
any rate limiting that might be

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,000
done by the server

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
it's important to note that in this case

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,799
um well before we started our work all

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,399
these vulnerabilities had existing

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
patches so it wasn't that wordpress had

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,598
to develop something first or there was

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
like brand new thing but at least like

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
six month old patches existed

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
in total we found that about 44 000

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
domains in the alexa top million were

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
susceptible to one of these

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
vulnerabilities and used this as our

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,440
first data set

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,959
the second data set

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,200
consisted of previously unknown

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
client-side or also dom-based

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
cross-over-scripting vulnerabilities we

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,599
discovered with the methodology we

76
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,160
presented at ccs three years ago

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
and in contrast to the wordpress flaws

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,319
these things are site-specific so

79
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
there's no kind of one-size-fits-all

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
solution to these bugs um but rather the

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
developers of the website have to fix

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
them themselves um and more importantly

83
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
obviously there's no kind of auto update

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,519
feature for these for these

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,080
vulnerabilities so no existing patches

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
are around

87
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
so in order to now try to notify the

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
affected parties we thought about world

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
communication channels we could use and

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,840
first we're talking about web here so

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
you can directly go to a website

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
oftentimes fill out a contact form even

93
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
potentially even give uh yeah the type

94
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
of message or state the type of message

95
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
that you're sending so you're

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,319
sending a security vulnerability

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
notification but obviously this doesn't

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
scale right not all websites in the top

99
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
million have this and even if they did

100
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
probably they would have some capture

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
that you cannot sell automatically

102
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
so rather we focused on using different

103
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,840
types of email addresses and that is on

104
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
the one hand side what we call generic

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
email aliases which is infoad security

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,280
at webmaster ad and abuse at that domain

107
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
and on top of that also information we

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
get that from the who is registry that

109
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
is either the registrant of the domain

110
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
or the technical contact if there is no

111
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
registrant test

112
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,080
so next to directly trying to talk to

113
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
these people we can also involve

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
intermediaries and one of the most well

115
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,799
studied media is there is a

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,400
vulnerability reward programs so there

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
have been papers also presented here at

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
usenix that really show that these work

119
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,239
quite well for all those companies that

120
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
take part in these erp programs however

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,080
this goes back to the same problem with

122
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,920
the web contact forms not everybody is a

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
member and not obviously all the top

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,159
million sites can be reached this way

125
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
so rather what we did is we selected to

126
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,319
notify the hosting providers more

127
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
specifically the abuse contacts because

128
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
this is the closest thing that you can

129
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
get to a security contact in a hosting

130
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,720
company

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
and as well as what we call trusted

132
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
third parties and these are on the one

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
hand side regional thirds such as for

134
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,520
example the u.s search or the german

135
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
cert

136
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
as well as the umbrella third

137
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,919
organization which is called first and

138
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,520
then the trusted community ops trust

139
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
where actually one of our co-authors was

140
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
a member

141
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,479
all right so with these two

142
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,000
yeah prerequisites let me now talk a

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
little bit about the notification

144
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
procedure

145
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
so first we split up the data set of

146
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
vulnerable domains into five groups of

147
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
exactly equal size that is four

148
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
notification groups as discussed before

149
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,919
as well as then one control group to see

150
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
what would regularly go on on the

151
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
internet if nobody told people about the

152
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
vulnerabilities

153
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
we sent out the notification via email

154
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
but in this email we did not disclose

155
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
the vulnerability in whole but we rather

156
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,240
said okay you have a vulnerability this

157
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
is the type of vulnerability if you want

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
to know more about this please

159
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
visit our website where we've prepared

160
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
all the details on the impact the

161
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,520
problem etc and this was obviously done

162
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
so that we could actually measure how

163
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,120
long people it would take people to

164
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
react to our emails or if they would

165
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,080
react at all

166
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
alternatively if people didn't want to

167
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
click on a link and if you send somebody

168
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
an email saying hey you have a crossout

169
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
scripting please click on this link this

170
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,280
might sound a little fishy

171
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
we actually offered them the opportunity

172
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
to also use a secret token which was

173
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,479
contained in the email so they could

174
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,080
just send us an email back and our

175
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
mailbox would actually automatically

176
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
respond with a report but again this way

177
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
we could measure the fact that they had

178
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
received the email and reacted to us

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
um while we sent one email per email

180
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
address for the direct notification

181
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
channels um sending about 9000 emails to

182
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
uh all the thirds would have been really

183
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
bad so there we opted for an aggregated

184
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,479
disclosure that is we sent them a csv

185
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,919
list it's like here are all the domains

186
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
within your constituency that have

187
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,919
vulnerabilities please handle it

188
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,680
accordingly

189
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,160
um we then send bi-weekly emails so the

190
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
first one on january 14th a reminder on

191
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,479
the january 28th

192
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
and the last one then on february 11th

193
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
which coincides roughly with a deadline

194
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
to a major security venue

195
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
and if people actually followed this

196
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
link

197
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,919
in our email they would present it be

198
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,520
presented with such a web interface so

199
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
on the top we again explain who we are

200
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
what we are doing here um and then on

201
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
the bottom they uh the administrators

202
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,039
could see the discovered vulnerabilities

203
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
for that specific domain so we see here

204
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
a type of vulnerability in this case dom

205
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
based crosstalk scripting when it was

206
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,720
last verified this way administrators

207
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
could actually check our website to see

208
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
if they were still available or they

209
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
successfully patched the problem but

210
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,039
also they could click here on view

211
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
report to get some more details and

212
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
would be presented with a site like this

213
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
so on top we explain again the problem

214
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
then what the impact is especially for

215
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
uh yeah

216
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,599
maybe not security aware wordpress users

217
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,639
explaining the impact of such

218
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,039
vulnerabilities is probably quite useful

219
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,479
then a proof of concept with for the

220
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
crossout scripting is just open an alert

221
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
box with a domain

222
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
and then steps on remediating the

223
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,560
vulnerability

224
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
in this case we're looking at a

225
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
vulnerability which is a client's across

226
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,120
that scripting and i said before there's

227
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
no one-size-fits-all solution to these

228
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
problems so here we rather only give the

229
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
list of files which were involved in the

230
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
exploitable data flow such that a

231
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
developer can actually kind of look um

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,599
especially at that file and try to find

233
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,039
out whether or not

234
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
vulnerability is and how to fix it for

235
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,960
wordpress this would basically just show

236
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
information on how to update the

237
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
installation

238
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
so throughout our campaign we did a

239
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
number of measurements so on the one

240
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,039
inside we did vulnerability monitoring

241
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,560
that is for wordpress we did actually

242
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
one proof of concept test per day

243
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,319
and for clients across the scripting we

244
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
went with one every three hours and this

245
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,479
comes from the fact that oftentimes

246
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,759
these clients are crosses scripting

247
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
issues are caused by third party for

248
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,800
example advertisements and many websites

249
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
have things like banner rotation so even

250
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
if you hit the same page twice you might

251
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
not get the same advertisement and

252
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
therefore not the same vulnerability so

253
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
this really just allowed us um to have a

254
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
higher chance of at least triggering the

255
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
vulnerability once per day

256
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
on top of that we looked at the mailbox

257
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
that we used to send the reports um as

258
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
well as then the log files from the from

259
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,319
the report interface to classify each

260
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,840
domain into one of the following four

261
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,800
states

262
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
reached means either somebody responded

263
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,240
to our email saying yes we got your

264
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
message or they viewed a report on the

265
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
web interface

266
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
bounced means all emails that we send to

267
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
that domain bounce that is for example

268
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
for the generic channel all four email

269
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
addresses didn't work

270
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,320
unreachable could happen if for example

271
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,479
for a given domain there is no whois

272
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,000
information so there is no email address

273
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,839
because it's not mandatory

274
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,839
or also sometimes we send out emails and

275
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,440
got automated responses back saying

276
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
please fill out this form on a website

277
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,399
and again this is not something that you

278
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
can do automatically at scale so we mark

279
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
these domains as unreachable and then

280
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
last but not least and any other domain

281
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
where we don't have any information has

282
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
to be marked as unknown

283
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
and while this is straightforward for

284
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,440
the direct communication channels

285
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
for the indirect communication channels

286
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
we can only really measure the first

287
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
step of the chain so if we reach the

288
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,800
intermediary or not um so as an example

289
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
if there's a domain which we disclosed

290
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
to via a provider and this domain viewed

291
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
a report on the web interface we

292
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
automatically mark all domains that we

293
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
also disclose to this provider as being

294
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
reached because by definition we must

295
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
have reached the intermediary because

296
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
otherwise nobody could have clicked the

297
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,720
link

298
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
all right so with these measurements let

299
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
me now briefly talk about the global

300
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
impact of our notification campaign

301
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
so on the left hand side we see

302
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
the number of fixed sites over time for

303
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,279
for wordpress and we see that until

304
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
january 14th

305
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,240
which is here shown with the dotted

306
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
lines so the first notification all

307
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
these lines are more or less the same

308
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
so the control group equals kind of all

309
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,160
the notified groups

310
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
after that there is kind of a gap

311
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
opening up between the control group and

312
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
the notified groups and this gap kind of

313
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
increases a little bit over time

314
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
and more precisely also after each

315
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
reminder round

316
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
the obvious question that comes to mind

317
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
in this case is why is there like a 22.5

318
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
fixed rate for domains in the control

319
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,519
group right we didn't tell them about

320
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,120
the vulnerabilities and this can be

321
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
easily explained by the fact that these

322
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,959
are wordpress installations and there

323
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
are existing patches to all the

324
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,839
vulnerabilities so really you just have

325
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
to update your wordpress and people do

326
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
this more or less regularly so this is

327
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,200
really what i would call kind of a

328
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
natural evolution of the vulnerabilities

329
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,279
that just go away over time just because

330
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,000
people update their wordpress

331
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
in this case the

332
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,760
best performing group was actually the

333
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
house which is here denoted as domain

334
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
contacts

335
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,680
but in total we only managed to kind of

336
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
help yeah about 280 remains be fixed

337
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,200
because this is the number

338
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
of fixed domains in the who is group on

339
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
top of the of the control group

340
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560
for client secret scripting the

341
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
situation looks quite different um so

342
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
here we see that the uh yeah the control

343
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
group in the end only fixed about uh two

344
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,680
percent of the of the vulnerabilities

345
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
and this is somewhat to be somewhat

346
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
expected right because they we didn't

347
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
tell them about it they probably didn't

348
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
know before um so this is most likely

349
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,079
like features that were included or

350
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,120
removed

351
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
so there's no such kind of natural decay

352
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
of the vulnerabilities

353
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,480
um here we see that the just the third

354
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
parties actually work best with a total

355
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,200
of 31 domains which which were fixed out

356
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
of 185 in that group so it's really like

357
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
just 17

358
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
and while this is uh pretty obvious for

359
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,959
the clients across the scripting also

360
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
the wordpress um actually so

361
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
statistically significant differences

362
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
between control group and our

363
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,040
notification campaign so we did have

364
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
statistically speaking a significant

365
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
impact however and i really want to

366
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,399
quote ourselves in the paper from the

367
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,680
paper here is

368
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
these

369
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
on yeah on the statistics side yeah

370
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
we're it's awesome and we're significant

371
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
however if you look at the number of

372
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,880
fixed domains this is really

373
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,279
unsatisfactory right so we have 25.8

374
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,720
percent of the wordpress domains which

375
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
we notified that fixed the vulnerability

376
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
but most of them actually due to this

377
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
natural decay of vulnerability rather

378
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
than our notifications and for clients

379
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
across the scripting yeah 12.6 again is

380
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
a way to low number

381
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
and what we now wanted to find out is

382
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,519
why did this happen and to answer this

383
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
we actually did an analysis of the

384
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
communication channels as such

385
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,240
and let me uh i want to go over here um

386
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
here over a couple of kind of the

387
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
highlights and for the further details

388
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,959
in the exact numbers please refer to the

389
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,920
paper

390
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,959
so first let's have a look at the

391
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
reachability of the direct communication

392
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
channels so generic email addresses from

393
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,480
wordpress so this is the top million

394
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
domains we see that here almost 50 of

395
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,360
all domains

396
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
bounced that means all four emails that

397
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,880
we sent to that domain um yeah didn't

398
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
make it and we see kind of this teeny

399
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
tiny blue part up here which is about

400
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,839
three percent of the domains which we

401
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,079
managed to reach with a large body of

402
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,279
unknowns here in the middle which can

403
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,920
either be because people didn't trust

404
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
the link or what i think is more likely

405
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
there is like silent bounces so the mail

406
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,279
server um yeah maybe accepted the email

407
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
um didn't bounce back maybe it ended in

408
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,519
a spam clip i have no idea

409
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,800
for the client secret scripting

410
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
situation looks a little bit different

411
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,800
so here we only have 30 bounces um but

412
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,160
more importantly we managed to reach

413
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
over 20 of the domains so this sounds

414
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
more promising that for for wordpress

415
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
for who is we have a different issue so

416
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
we again have a relatively new number

417
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,639
which is about six percent of the

418
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,160
domains which were reached and here we

419
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,639
see a big chunk um about 18

420
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,320
which are reachable and this is as i

421
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,079
said before caused by the fact that

422
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
there is simply no uh who is entry for

423
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,600
that domain or at least there is no

424
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
email address in that and that's who is

425
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
entry

426
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
um for client.xss situation looks a

427
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
little bit similar so we can have this

428
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
big chunk of about 18

429
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
but also managed to reach 20 of the

430
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
domains however reaching a domain does

431
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
not yet mean that they viewed the report

432
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,760
it

433
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,959
can also mean that they just

434
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,320
acknowledged our email didn't do

435
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,480
anything about it so one factor that is

436
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,320
actually more interesting is the number

437
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
of viewed reports and here we see that

438
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
there is rarely people who acknowledge

439
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
our email and then don't click

440
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
um but like there's a relatively high

441
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
conversion rate basically if a domain is

442
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
reached they will also have viewed the

443
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,800
domain

444
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,560
and i want to point your attention um to

445
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
actually this part here because this

446
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
accounts for 550 domains in the whois

447
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,440
group which we could reach in terms of

448
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
they viewed a domain report right so

449
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
they knew about the vulnerability

450
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,839
however only 280

451
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
were kind of fixed on top of the control

452
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,440
group so apparently it's not enough to

453
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
make people view the report or get them

454
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,040
to review the report but there must be

455
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
some other factors as well and i will

456
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
come back to that in a couple of slides

457
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,720
for the indirect channels um we have a

458
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
somewhat different scenario so for the

459
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,199
providers we managed to reach over 40 so

460
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,959
that is forty percent of those providers

461
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,600
either um yeah viewed a report or at

462
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
least acknowledged that they that they

463
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
got the email from us

464
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
um for client-side xss we have yeah

465
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,240
comparable numbers so uh yeah about 40

466
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,839
in this case here this chunk is not

467
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
caused by missing domain entries uh

468
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,000
missing email entry sorry but rather by

469
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
these automated responses saying please

470
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
fill out this web form to get in contact

471
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
with us

472
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
for the trusted third parties this looks

473
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,320
the situation looks much much better so

474
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
here we managed to reach 85 percent um

475
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
of all domains which sounds really

476
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,839
promising

477
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,720
and for clients at xss it's about 75

478
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
however we again have to consider that

479
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,399
reaching a domain is not sufficient but

480
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
rather we need them to view the report

481
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
so here the numbers are less good

482
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,519
in the end we see that especially for

483
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,279
wordpress and while there's many

484
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,639
providers and

485
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
trusted third parties we reached they

486
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
rarely

487
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
kind of took the information serious and

488
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,880
acted upon it

489
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,759
what we do observe is that about 40 of

490
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,120
the domains in the clients across the

491
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
scripting group um from trusted third

492
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
parties read a report and this actually

493
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,720
amounts to 70 trusted third-party

494
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,959
domains but if you think back to the 31

495
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,199
domains which were only fixed in this we

496
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
again have the same issue viewing a

497
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
report is not sufficient to

498
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
have the vulnerability fixed then

499
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,240
so one other thing that we looked at is

500
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
the time it took people to fix the

501
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,680
vulnerability after they had viewed a

502
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
report and we see this here on the

503
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
left-hand side for wordpress

504
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,880
but we see that within the first day

505
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
about 15 regardless of the group could

506
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
fix the vulnerability um and we see that

507
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
this curve kind of becomes less steep

508
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
after a couple of days actually it turns

509
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
out that after day five this increase in

510
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
the fixed domains uh corresponds to this

511
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,160
natural decay of vulnerability so it's

512
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
exactly the same as in the control group

513
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,600
so at that point it's no longer us it's

514
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
just yeah this natural evolution of the

515
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,959
vulnerability um

516
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
that that kicked in here

517
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
for client-side xss we can really see

518
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
such a trend what we can observe is that

519
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
in total it took them a little bit

520
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
longer

521
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
to reach the

522
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
fixed rates in the end here we see that

523
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
actually the generic channel performed

524
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
best with about 38 fixed rate um but on

525
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,399
average it's about 25

526
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
of the domains that fix the

527
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
vulnerability once they had viewed the

528
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,480
report

529
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
and basically all these factors so

530
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
reaching somebody in the first place um

531
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
then having them view the report and

532
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,759
then

533
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,759
from the report having been viewed to

534
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
the domain being fixed and all these

535
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
factors that really cause these issues

536
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
with reaching out to the affected

537
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
parties

538
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,880
and with this i'd really like to know

539
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
kind of focus on some of the key

540
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
insights that we gained and also ask a

541
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,959
number of follow-up questions for future

542
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
research

543
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
so what we saw is that establishing

544
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
communication channels is quite tough so

545
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
for the direct channels these are very

546
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
hard to reach so these generic email

547
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,400
aliases they perform horribly for the

548
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
top million with 50 of them

549
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
bouncing the us information helps so

550
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,199
actually who is was the best channel for

551
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,039
for the wordpress installations but

552
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,400
there's like about one-fifth of the

553
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
domains which lack an email entry um so

554
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
there's no way we could reach them

555
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,039
um and for the direct for the indirect

556
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
channels these are somewhat easier to

557
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,520
reach right so um there's like less of

558
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,080
them obviously and

559
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
what we found is that oftentimes they

560
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
just don't forward the information um

561
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,200
turns out actually that the top five

562
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
providers

563
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
of hosting vulnerable domains

564
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
and didn't do a single thing that is

565
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,080
they didn't vet the information so they

566
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
didn't view a report on the website and

567
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
obviously then also didn't forward the

568
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,039
information um

569
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,039
so this is definitely a problem that

570
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,520
needs to be addressed by them

571
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,039
however the research question that

572
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
really comes out of this is how can the

573
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
security community and i don't

574
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
necessarily mean the research community

575
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
because this might not be a research

576
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,039
problem but rather a kind of political

577
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,280
issue come up with reliable means of

578
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,559
establishing communication channels

579
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
between a researcher and the affected

580
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
parties to kind of allow for a smooth

581
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,320
notification process

582
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
one other thing that we saw is that

583
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
actually reminders helped quite a bit

584
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,600
especially for the direct communication

585
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,039
channel so here on the right-hand side

586
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,520
we see the number of domains that viewed

587
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
a report at least once on our web

588
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
interface over time basically the first

589
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
time they use the report and again here

590
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,559
we see the red dotted lines which denote

591
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,640
the reminders so here we see

592
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,799
a steep improvement on these curves as

593
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
well as over here um for clients across

594
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,679
the scripting actually the first

595
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
reminder had a bigger impact than the

596
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
second one but still we managed to

597
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
kind of still poke people enough to at

598
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,080
least have a look at the report once

599
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
what we also found is that the report

600
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
once it was viewed led to a about 25 to

601
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,440
30 fixed rate um but after five days the

602
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
fixed rate for wordpress somewhat

603
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
equaled that of the control group so the

604
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
effect had completely gone away so if i

605
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,240
were to do this exact experiment again i

606
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
would probably yeah keep sending out

607
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,760
emails every five days to poke people

608
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
and say hey you're still vulnerable

609
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
thanks for viewing the report but maybe

610
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,919
you should you should do something about

611
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,360
this

612
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,799
um but the question that really comes

613
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,240
out of this is why was the ratio from

614
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
viewer report to getting the domain

615
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
fixed not higher and i think this is

616
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,679
definitely interesting to to determine

617
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,600
in the future how we can improve upon

618
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
this fixed ratio did we not phrase the

619
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
put the information in yeah

620
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
understandable terms was it too

621
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
technical was it not technically enough

622
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,640
and this is really something that should

623
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
be addressed by future work

624
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
another thing is

625
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
the sender reputation so there has been

626
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
previous work presented at wise last

627
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,679
year and they looked at notifying

628
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,440
websites or actually providers of

629
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,799
websites

630
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
about

631
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
malware in fact infections they had on

632
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,160
their on their sites of other customers

633
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
and what they tried is basically used

634
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,080
different uh centers so like a

635
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
university a random

636
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,880
researcher with a real name and some uh

637
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
random alias and they found that

638
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
actually

639
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
it didn't seem to matter who sent the

640
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,360
information the fixed rate were equally

641
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,320
bad

642
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
um however our work somewhat begs to

643
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
differ so we found that when we analyzed

644
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
the data that we had that the german

645
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
search was more inclined to forward our

646
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
information and this is most likely due

647
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,159
to the fact that actually one of our

648
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,760
co-authors had had dealings with the

649
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,320
german serve before so they just knew

650
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,159
him they trusted him and then forward

651
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
the information

652
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,559
also

653
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,400
providers were more inclined to actually

654
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
act upon the the notification if it came

655
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,240
from the german so there was one

656
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
provider which had about 200 domains in

657
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
both the the provider data set as well

658
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
as the trusted third-party data set

659
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
and those domains which were notified

660
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,720
via the d2 over the german cert had

661
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
about 60

662
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
uh 60 view rate whereas the ones that we

663
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
disclosed directly to them had zero

664
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,919
percent view rate so they simply

665
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
discarded our message but they believe

666
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
the information from the german cert um

667
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,840
and even i mean even if they didn't

668
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,720
trust us the first time that after the

669
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
they had gotten the same or information

670
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
on the same type of abilities from the

671
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,840
german third they might have thought

672
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,600
yeah well these guys might be might be

673
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,440
legitimate here

674
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,480
but the question that comes out of this

675
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,840
is really what is the impact of the

676
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,520
sender reputation especially when using

677
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
such intermediaries on on the effect or

678
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,440
the success of such a notification

679
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,520
campaign

680
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
so one thing that we needed to do and i

681
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
said this in the beginning for our

682
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
experiment was actually uh yeah we asked

683
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,159
users to click a link or at least send

684
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,440
us an email back

685
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
with a secret token

686
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
such that they could access the report

687
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,760
and if you think about the training that

688
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
hopefully everybody gets both on the

689
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,840
university as well as in companies

690
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
you are trying not to do that right

691
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,799
there's a fishy email that's coming in

692
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,679
you don't you don't click the link um so

693
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,000
we were well aware of this and wanted to

694
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
try to determine whether this was

695
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
actually an issue for our work or not so

696
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
what we did is at the end of our

697
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
experiment that is right after the

698
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
submission

699
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
we

700
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,799
notified the domains that were still

701
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
vulnerable in the control group so on

702
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,760
the one inside we wanted to notify them

703
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
as well because we had explicitly

704
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
excluded them before so it was the the

705
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,960
ethical thing to do

706
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,320
but also what we did actually we sent

707
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,480
them an email with the full disclosure

708
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,679
so we didn't send them a link or

709
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,480
something but like here's the

710
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,080
vulnerability description this is how

711
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,640
you can fix it etc

712
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
and we then checked the statistical

713
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
significance when comparing it to the

714
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
ones that we sent with a link and for

715
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,799
clients across the scripting that didn't

716
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,720
make a difference and for wordpress it

717
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
did make a difference however not

718
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,760
necessarily in the way that one would

719
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
expect because actually the emails that

720
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
had the full disclosure in the initial

721
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
email they performed worse than the ones

722
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,640
with the link so people were more

723
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,919
inclined to fix the vulnerability if

724
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,559
they had a link they could click on

725
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,880
and one potential issue here might have

726
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,480
been the message length so there's like

727
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
a super long message which is very

728
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,919
technical right away

729
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,600
you don't have kind of a trust anchor in

730
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
terms of an https certificate

731
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:52,880
so

732
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
this might have all kind of factored

733
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
into this this issue and the question

734
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
that um yeah i would like to see

735
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
answered is really to what extent does

736
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
the message tone

737
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
um the message content but also the

738
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,520
message length influence the success of

739
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
of these campaigns um if we want to

740
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
notify people about vulnerabilities

741
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,039
last but not least

742
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
it appears that the results are somewhat

743
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,280
dependent on the application domain

744
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
so actually frank who's up next and i'm

745
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
just spoiling a little of your results

746
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,320
here

747
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
found that the providers which were

748
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,039
really horrible on our end and worked

749
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,120
better than the the certs so the trusted

750
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
third parties so they were just looking

751
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
at different types of vulnerabilities

752
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,919
for them they worked better for us they

753
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,600
didn't work at all

754
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
similarly for heartbleed

755
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
they the number of fixes

756
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
were way higher maybe because the impact

757
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
was higher of the vulnerability this is

758
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
something that needs uh

759
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,919
is up to speculation

760
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,240
and but really it shows that there is no

761
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,559
one-size-fits-all solution to this

762
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,480
notification problem

763
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
but also interestingly

764
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,919
even within the same application domain

765
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,039
that is web application issues we found

766
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
that the results differ so the generic

767
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,159
channel performed really badly on

768
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
wordpress but it actually performed

769
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
reasonably well for the for these higher

770
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
ranked uh clients across the scripting

771
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
domains

772
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
um so this is definitely um yeah an

773
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
interesting fact as well

774
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,480
so actually out of this i want to ask

775
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,159
two questions so on the one hand side

776
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,320
our campaigns more successful if the

777
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,679
vulnerabilities gain media attention

778
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
such as heartbleed or also now just

779
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
recently drown

780
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
um but also on the other hand does it

781
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,400
matter who needs to fix the

782
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,960
vulnerability so in the case of of

783
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
heartbeat or drown it's the network

784
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
admin who's probably very technically

785
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
savvy in the case of client-side

786
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,840
crossover scriptings it's typically the

787
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,440
website developer so he hopefully is

788
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
also quite savvy in javascript um

789
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
or is it the end user in this case for

790
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
wordpress it's really you don't have to

791
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,919
patch the vulnerability but you just

792
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,480
have to update your installation

793
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
all right with this i'd like to conclude

794
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,880
my talk um so we conducted the first

795
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
analysis the notifications for web

796
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,960
vulnerabilities at scale um using two

797
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
data sets that is on the one inside

798
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
well-known wordpress flaws as well as

799
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
previously unknown clients across the

800
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,880
scripting issues we uh yeah checked out

801
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
different

802
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,360
communication channels that is both

803
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,480
direct and indirect and we found that

804
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
although the results show a

805
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,919
statistically significant improvement

806
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,000
that was caused by our campaign um and

807
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
that who is worked best for wordpress

808
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,120
and the trusted third parties work best

809
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
for um for clients across that scripting

810
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,760
the overall improvement was very much

811
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,679
unsatisfactory so by the end of our

812
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,600
experiment about three quarters of all

813
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,360
domains in our data set were still

814
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,320
vulnerable

815
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,039
and they probably are even today

816
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,840
and

817
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,360
yeah when trying to identify what the

818
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
main issues were we found that really

819
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
the biggest problem as such is reaching

820
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
the administrators in the first place um

821
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,720
while this 30 or 25 to 30 fixed rate can

822
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
be improved upon it still is a good uh

823
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,200
good start um once we reach them in the

824
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,559
first place and with this i'd like to

825
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,840
thank you very much for your attention

826
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
and i'm happy to answer any questions

827
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,890
that you might have

828
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:02,939
[Applause]

829
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,200
just gonna give him time

830
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,520
um abner mendoza texas a m um very nice

831
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
work

832
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,039
um i was wondering your numbers um the

833
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,799
statistics that you showed look similar

834
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,520
to

835
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
for example email marketing numbers in

836
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,559
terms of opening rates of emails so i'm

837
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,720
wondering if uh

838
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,279
you thought about testing perhaps even

839
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
the design of the email so it has some

840
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,279
kind of element of pers

841
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,279
to persuade the the

842
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,200
users to either afford it or you know

843
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,520
act upon the email itself

844
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
um so that's definitely a good point so

845
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,799
i didn't know that the marketing numbers

846
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,880
are are similar but um it turns out

847
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
actually with a with a co-author um i

848
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
discussed this just last week that

849
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
actually if we want to study this more

850
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,679
we would have to find somebody from

851
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,919
marketing who knows how you have to talk

852
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,080
to people because i'm a technical guy so

853
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
i'm going to tell you technical details

854
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,919
um but probably this might

855
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,840
yeah have some negative influence

856
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
obviously on

857
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
the average user who doesn't know about

858
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
anything about this but this is

859
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,360
definitely something that we want to do

860
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
in future work um because it's

861
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
definitely interesting to understand why

862
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,159
people

863
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,320
didn't click the or didn't trust the

864
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,880
emails yeah you know i think even just

865
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,440
like the design of the email

866
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
so it has some kind of sense of urgency

867
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,200
for example like fake av the fake av

868
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,279
with pop-ups that you get you have to

869
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,640
act now

870
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
you know so

871
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,159
that might might give you

872
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,360
different results so this is basically

873
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
the email that we sent um

874
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,039
so basically here we're explaining what

875
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,720
we're doing what the vulnerability is

876
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,960
here what the what the impact is

877
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
and then here we explain to them how

878
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,960
they can um

879
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
yeah how they can reach us on the web

880
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,679
interface or use this uh token here and

881
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
i even went as far as to add my phone

882
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,799
number and there's actually people who

883
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,840
called me

884
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,320
um saying is this real it's like yeah i

885
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,679
mean

886
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,440
i'm not sure if the telephone channel is

887
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,679
in this case the authenticated one

888
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,200
but i totally agree that there is

889
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
definitely room for improvement on the

890
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,480
on the emails

891
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,440
thank you thanks

892
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,919
thanks for the talk yes on bosch qcri

893
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,600
you know i have i think just two

894
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,120
comments about this i think this is one

895
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
of the studies where qualitative data

896
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,720
would increase the quantitative results

897
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,880
um because i mean

898
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,200
in the industry 20 days is really a

899
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
short time period to fix something it's

900
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,039
like two sprints and

901
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,960
if it's coming from outside from

902
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,159
non-paying

903
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,000
your customer really they're going to

904
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
put that

905
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,919
much lower in the priority list so i

906
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,840
guess 20 days is just a short time

907
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
period to measure whether they're

908
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
actually worked on that

909
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,799
um so

910
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
have you considered uh actually

911
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
interviewing talking to two groups those

912
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,360
who responded uh and the others who did

913
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,080
not and try to understand why yeah so i

914
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,120
mean

915
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
i absolutely agree with you on the kind

916
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,279
of qualitative investigation that we

917
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,760
should do um because

918
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,679
the problem in this case is

919
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,960
we can't talk to the people that

920
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,200
responded to us but how do we talk to

921
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,799
the people that didn't respond to us

922
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,559
that's one thing that you can do right

923
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,399
um i think we were also discussing kind

924
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,080
of writing them emails and calling them

925
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,200
saying hey did you get our message did

926
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,120
you just ignore us

927
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,559
i think that's that's definitely an

928
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,520
interesting um an interesting problem um

929
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,640
i feel

930
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
actually i only showed the graphs that

931
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
we have in the paper so with the fixed

932
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
rates but we observed that actually this

933
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,320
fixed rate for the for the client-side

934
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,080
xss issues it doesn't really get that

935
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
much higher and also the number of

936
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,520
domains that view the report didn't

937
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,760
increase over time more so basically it

938
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,600
stopped so we had the the effect

939
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
notifying people reminding them this

940
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
always increased the the numbers

941
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
but after that it kind of remained

942
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
stable so in this case at this point

943
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
people did not even look at the report

944
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
because if i can only imagine if a

945
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
company gets an email saying there's a

946
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
vulnerability um they don't just put it

947
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,600
on a somewhere without actually looking

948
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
at it first right

949
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
i mean you can take a look at apache

950
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
projects and there's a lot of such

951
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,399
issues open and

952
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,000
pulled that's a good comment thanks

953
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,520
unfortunately i think we're out of time

954
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,240
so

955
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
i just want to make one quick comment

956
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
quick i run an abuse desk

957
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,159
and if i get reports from multiple

958
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,559
channels about the same thing it's going

959
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
to probably get binned as spam

960
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,919
yes but you wouldn't get the same

961
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,360
information from different channels so

962
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
your domain would either be your study

963
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
that's fine but we we encounter this all

964
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,760
the time with somebody that's really

965
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,559
exercised about our ntp server

966
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,679
thanks

967
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,880
all right let's thank our speaker one

968
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,120
more time
