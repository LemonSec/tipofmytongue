1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
so again my name is frank lee i'm a grad

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
student from uc berkeley and today i'd

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,519
like to talk about some of our recent

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
efforts in better understanding security

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,600
notification sent to vulnerable hosts

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,880
this is a joint work with a number of

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,320
collaborators listed here across

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
multiple institutions now i'm sure

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,920
everyone's already wondering about how

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
this compares to the previous talk and

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,840
indeed the subject matter is very

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,760
similar however in our talk we'll be

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,200
focusing on a different set of

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
vulnerabilities particularly those

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
affecting servers and routers whereas

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,280
ben's talk focused on vulnerable

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,719
websites

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,840
additionally we'll be looking at

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
different notification factors however i

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
think the two studies actually together

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
complement each other really nicely in

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
providing a lot deeper insights into

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
the space of vulnerability notifications

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
so the previous talk already nicely

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,879
framed the importance of vulnerability

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,320
notifications but just in case you

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
missed it let me take a second go at it

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
from a slightly different angle

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,319
so as security researchers over the

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
years we've gained a lot of experience

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
and a lot of insights in a large number

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
of things such as discovering security

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
bugs i'm not saying we're particularly

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
good at finding all bugs in any piece of

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
software we still have some work to do

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
there but at the very least we regularly

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,720
find high impact security

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
vulnerabilities

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,080
and for these vulnerabilities over the

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
years we've increased our capabilities

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
in detecting which hosts are vulnerable

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
to a security issue and we do this

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
through a variety of tools and

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,680
techniques such as network scanning

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
intrusion detection or network

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,439
monitoring and large-scale website

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
crawling and analysis

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
a final area that we've gained a lot of

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,759
experience in is identifying remedies

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,200
for these vulnerabilities such as

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
developing patches or configuration

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
changes

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
now there's something that's related to

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,000
all three of these areas so that

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
as a community we lack a lot of

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,840
significant experience and insight into

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
and that's taking all the great work

58
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
that we've done in these different areas

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
and realizing real world improvements in

60
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
security

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
there's a very simple question out there

62
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
which we don't have a great answer to

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
which is how do we get those that are

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
affected by a security issue to

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
remediate and adam has brought this up

66
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,560
as has been

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
as community we don't have a great

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
answer to this and when we have tried

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
this in the past it's been often in a

70
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
very ad hoc and rather uninformed

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
process and this is really what

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
motivates our study on vulnerability

73
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,239
notifications the concept is extremely

74
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,520
simple and

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
after coming

76
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
after ben's talk i'm sure you're already

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
familiar with it but a security

78
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
researcher of course with five monitors

79
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
discovers some vulnerability and

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,560
identifies that a certain host is

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
vulnerable to that security issue he can

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
compose a message and send it off to the

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
admin of the host and then hopefully the

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
host of the admin will resolve the

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,599
security issue

86
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
now in principle this is extremely

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
simple but when you actually start

88
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,480
thinking about it and trying to do it in

89
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
practice a number of really simple

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
questions come up such as well do

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
notifications work at all

92
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
and if they do work who do you contact

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
what kind of information do you convey

94
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
in the message itself

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
how do you say this message or how do

96
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
you present this to the recipient and do

97
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,159
operators even want to receive these

98
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
notifications even if it is effective is

99
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,080
this something that they consider in

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
their normal range of operations

101
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
now of course the space of vulnerability

102
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,319
notifications has a huge problem space

103
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,159
and an even larger solution space and as

104
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
you'll see uh ben and on my talk

105
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
explored just a small portion of it but

106
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,799
these are some of the fundamental

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,959
questions that if anyone's trying to do

108
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,560
uh notifications these days that we

109
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
think are important to answer

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,159
so in today's talk i'd like to provide

111
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
some insights from our study on answers

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
to all of these different questions

113
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
so to gain such insights we conduct

114
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
multiple notification experiments across

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
different vulnerabilities so for each

116
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,840
each vulnerability we do controlled

117
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
multivariate uh

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
controlled voltage variant experiments

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
where we test different notification

120
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
methodologies or different notification

121
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,599
treatments and observe how the

122
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
remediation rate differs across these

123
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
different treatments

124
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,640
so first let me describe what variables

125
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
we're going to be testing when it comes

126
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
to who to contact about a vulnerability

127
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,599
we consider three different options

128
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
which are similar to the ones that ben

129
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
took a look at

130
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
so we look at the whois abuse contact so

131
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
given the ip address of a vulnerable

132
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,920
host you can look up the whois record

133
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
and find the abuse email

134
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
the next two options both involve the

135
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
network assert organizations

136
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,079
but we look at two different ways of

137
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
interfacing with asserts

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
one is to enter this network through a

139
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
local node so using our local us search

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
since we're all us universities and the

141
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
idea here is that it'd be great if a

142
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
researcher could simply send all the

143
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
vulnerability information to a single

144
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
entity and have that information

145
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,720
propagated to the proper parties

146
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
the other option that we look at is

147
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
actually contacting the national asserts

148
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
with purview over a specific host

149
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
directly so given the ip address of a

150
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
vulnerable host we geolocate it and find

151
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
which national insert has purview over

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
that area and again the reason why we

153
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
look at both of these options is because

154
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
one involves significantly more work for

155
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
the notifier in actually finding out all

156
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,759
of these different national certs to

157
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,440
contact versus just one that they could

158
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
send the information to and have it

159
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
propagated to the proper parties

160
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,360
when we look at what to convey the

161
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
solution space for this is huge and even

162
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
the questions in the last talk already

163
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
brought some of this up but we looked at

164
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
one very simple question which is how

165
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,479
much detail should there be in the in

166
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,080
the message itself

167
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
on one hand perhaps something that's

168
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
very to the point we'll convince the

169
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,400
operator or tell them immediately what

170
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
the problem is so they can deal with it

171
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,759
but perhaps something much more detail

172
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,800
will actually provide them with

173
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
information that they need

174
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
so we look at three variants of the

175
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
messages the first is a very terse

176
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
message or to the point message it's

177
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
essentially just three or four sentences

178
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
says who we are what vulnerability we

179
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
detected and what we detected on the

180
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
network it's very to the point but very

181
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
short

182
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
the second variant is a terse

183
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,600
notification with a link to a more

184
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
detailed information webpage that we set

185
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,320
up

186
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
with details such as why the

187
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
vulnerability matters how we detected it

188
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
and how they might actually remediate it

189
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,319
but of course with a link who knows if

190
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,520
they're actually going to click on it or

191
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
not

192
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
our final option is a verbose message

193
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,800
with all of the details essentially in

194
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,479
the message itself it also has a link to

195
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,600
the information page because it's a

196
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,840
little longer but all of the crucial

197
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
information is in this notification

198
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,919
itself it also says like for example how

199
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,120
they might resolve this issue

200
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
so when we looked at how to say it this

201
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
is also another area where there's a

202
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,919
huge solution space and there's a lot of

203
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,120
different ways you can present the

204
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
notification to the recipient we look at

205
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
one simple question again which is does

206
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
translating notifications help

207
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
on one hand translating a notification

208
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
into multiple different languages is a

209
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
lot of work for the notifier but on the

210
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
other hand it's also uh it could perhaps

211
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,039
potentially make the notification more

212
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,720
effective because it overcomes the

213
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,479
language barrier

214
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,160
so with these notifications with these

215
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
variables we want to test different

216
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,759
treatments on a vulnerable population so

217
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
what are the vulnerabilities that we

218
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
look at we look at three classes of

219
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,560
security vulnerabilities or security

220
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,280
misconfigurations

221
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
the first are publicly accessible

222
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
industrial control systems or ics for

223
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,840
short

224
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
for those of you are unfamiliar with

225
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
these these are devices that allow for

226
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
remote control and monitoring of

227
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
physical infrastructure such as hvac

228
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,440
systems power plants manufacturing

229
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
plants

230
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
so critical stuff

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
but often the protocols that these

232
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,360
devices communicate on lack basic

233
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
security features such as authentication

234
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
or encryption and

235
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
vulnerabilities have been found in these

236
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
protocols in the past

237
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
to find publicly accessible ics devices

238
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
we use a z-map with a module that has

239
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,319
signatures for these different protocols

240
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,440
that was developed by some of our

241
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
colleagues to scan for the ipv4 address

242
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
space and we found 45 000 publicly

243
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
accessible ics hosts based off their

244
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,759
work

245
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
and we also use zmapp to follow up on

246
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,639
scanning these over time

247
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
our second security issue our

248
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,479
misconfigured ipv6 firewalls and this

249
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,080
follows up on work that was presented at

250
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
mdss this past

251
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,319
spring

252
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
by one of my co-authors the issue is

253
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,080
actually very simple when you have a

254
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
dual stack host that's available on both

255
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
ipv4 and ipv6 you have separate

256
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
firewalls that both need to be

257
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
maintained

258
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,479
server administrators are usually pretty

259
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
good and quite experienced with locking

260
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,879
down ipv4 however sometimes they forget

261
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
about ipv6 and leave some service

262
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
unintentionally opened and this

263
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
increases the attack surface on the dual

264
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
stack host

265
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,199
this is especially true when the service

266
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,240
is something that really should not be

267
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
accessible such as telnet

268
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,599
so to detect these inconsistent firewall

269
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
policies we use cada's scamper tool

270
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,120
which was also

271
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
developed or expanded on in the ndss

272
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
study and we scanned the vulnerable dual

273
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
stack hosts that were identified first

274
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
in that ndss paper

275
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
we found 8 000 routers and 172 000

276
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,120
servers that still had inconsistent

277
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
firewall policies

278
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,279
our final set of vulnerabilities i'm

279
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
sure everyone is already very familiar

280
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
with and these are the ddos amplifiers

281
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,159
which are protocols that have been

282
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
abused for the massive ddos attacks that

283
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
we've seen more and more lately

284
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
we actually observed 84 000 various

285
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
amplifiers in actual attacks on the

286
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,839
network that we were monitoring and we

287
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,360
decided to track these using a daily

288
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
protocol scan so we would scan for

289
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
essentially the availability of charging

290
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
of ntp monoliths or recursive dns

291
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,880
so these are the vulnerabilities that we

292
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
tested and here are basically the

293
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,640
strategies that we use to detect them

294
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
and track them over time and these are

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
the populations that

296
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
we'll be notifying about so to do our

297
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
experiment though we need to split these

298
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,760
vulnerable hosts into different groups

299
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,959
that are going to receive different

300
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
notification treatments

301
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
so that we can see how the remediation

302
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
rates differ for these different

303
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,399
treatments

304
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,839
so i'm just going to go at this at a

305
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
high level because the paper will

306
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
discuss it in much more detail

307
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
but at a high level we find the whois

308
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
abuse contact for all of these different

309
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
hosts and we group them

310
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,120
by the host by these contacts and then

311
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
we randomly assign contacts to these

312
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
different experiment groups that are

313
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
going to receive different notification

314
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
treatments

315
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
just to give you a sense of the scale of

316
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,160
the experiment

317
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,240
the table here lists the number of whois

318
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
contacts that we have in each of the

319
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,240
different data sets so this will give

320
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,200
you a sense that there's several

321
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,480
thousand contacts that are going to be

322
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,120
involved in our experiment

323
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
so i'm going to show how we actually

324
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,760
allocate these contacts to different

325
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,519
groups this diagram is not to scale so

326
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,360
look at the paper for much more detail

327
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
but first we split up all of our

328
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
contacts by who is going to be contacted

329
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,959
or who is going to be notified

330
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,200
so we first have a control group

331
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
which is a control group so we can

332
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
compare our notifications against and

333
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
they won't be notified and then we have

334
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
our circ groups as well as our whois

335
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
groups

336
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
next we figure out what we're going to

337
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,959
convey to them in terms of the level of

338
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,399
detail and for the control group since

339
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,519
we're not sending them anything

340
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
obviously we're going to convey nothing

341
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
although i do want to say at the end of

342
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
our study we do notify everyone

343
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,880
the us third and for national search we

344
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,920
send them a

345
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
verbose message in fact for the search

346
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,279
we're not really testing out what to

347
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,720
convey because we actually are using

348
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
them as a middleman so we're not

349
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
actually directly testing out what

350
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
operators will receive because the

351
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,440
search will end up doing whatever they

352
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
typically do so we send them a verbose

353
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
email with as much detail as possible

354
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
aggregated with all hosts that are in

355
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,320
their purview

356
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
to test the levels of detail we actually

357
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
do this for the whois group where we

358
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
split it into three different groups

359
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
based off the levels of detail so terse

360
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
turismos link and verbose

361
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,399
now there's a small sliver of the who is

362
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,320
left and this is actually reserved for

363
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
our language experiment so for contacts

364
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
in countries that we were able to obtain

365
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
translations for we reserve them for our

366
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,040
language experiment which i'll talk

367
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
about in a little bit more detail when

368
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
we get there

369
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
so for actually notifying all of the

370
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
different

371
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,839
contacts in our various treatment groups

372
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,680
we sent emails from our berkeley email

373
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,519
address and all of our notifications

374
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,440
actually also came with a link to an

375
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,519
anonymous survey which served as an

376
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
anonymous feedback channel for operators

377
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
to actually provide us with feedback and

378
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
what they thought about our detection

379
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
and our notification process and then we

380
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
monitored remediation after our

381
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800
notifications for several months

382
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
so what did we actually see

383
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
unfortunately ben has spoiled a little

384
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
bit of it but there's still some

385
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
interesting tidbits

386
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
so first do notification works uh well

387
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,839
if they didn't then i could you know

388
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
finish my talk very early which would be

389
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,639
nice but

390
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
uh we'll see if that is true or not so

391
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
the graph here shows the percent of

392
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
contacts are fixed after two weeks so

393
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,839
essentially the two-week remediation

394
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,600
rate for each of our different data set

395
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
and we'll be comparing the best notified

396
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
group compared to the control

397
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,320
so we see for both ics uh the industrial

398
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
control systems or for ipv6 we see

399
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
statistically significant impact from

400
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
our notifications with an additional 10

401
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,639
to 15 percent of the contacts

402
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
remediating compared to the control

403
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,880
unfortunately we don't see this for ddos

404
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
which is rather unfortunate because

405
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
arguably ddos is the more serious of all

406
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
of our issues uh one reason why we

407
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,079
believe why this might be the case is

408
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,200
because there's actually been

409
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
significant effort done by this

410
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
community already in reducing the number

411
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
of open amplifiers actually uh christian

412
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
rousseau did that a paper a couple years

413
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
ago at usnix about these large-scale

414
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,920
notification campaigns and this is

415
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
actually almost a testament to how

416
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
effective this might be in terms of

417
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,639
reducing

418
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
a certain security issue

419
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,040
as far as we know for ics and ipv6 there

420
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
have been no large-scale notifications

421
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
similarly

422
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,880
another thing with ddos is that we

423
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
first detected these amplifiers in

424
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
actual attacks so this likely indicates

425
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
organizations that have rather poor

426
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
security stances in monitoring and

427
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,480
managing the network

428
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,720
so we see clearly that in some cases

429
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,160
notifications can work but this does

430
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
vary domain to domain

431
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
so in the cases where it does work so

432
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
for ics and ipv6 ipv6 who should we

433
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
contact ben already actually kind of

434
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
hinted at what this is but this is again

435
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
the two-week remediation rate split by

436
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
the point of contact so we actually saw

437
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,720
that the whois

438
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
contacts remediated at the highest rate

439
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,639
we saw the national service actually

440
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,040
mediated an improved rate as well

441
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,279
however it's between the whois group and

442
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,200
the control group so not as well as the

443
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
huiz group and unfortunately for us cert

444
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,639
which we had hoped would just kind of

445
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
distribute our information to the rest

446
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
of the assert network uh they actually

447
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,839
did not take any actions and they did

448
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
not uh exhibit any improved remediation

449
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,600
so from this we conclude that if you are

450
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,880
trying to do notification campaigns

451
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
these days it's actually best to use the

452
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,959
whois contact and this is actually a

453
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,480
rather unfortunate result because

454
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
ideally as researchers we would rely on

455
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,399
some central entity that would make this

456
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,760
process much easier that there's a

457
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,199
single organization where we can send

458
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,240
them our information about a

459
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,519
vulnerability and they would distribute

460
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,600
it to the affected parties but instead

461
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
it looks like the best results actually

462
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
come if you have to do all of this work

463
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
of finding the whois contacts and then

464
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,519
actually reaching out to them

465
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
individually

466
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
so when you do contact them uh

467
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,040
specifically the who is contacts what

468
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,440
kind of details should you provide

469
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
so we actually saw for both ipv6 and ics

470
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320
that the whois verbose so the very

471
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
detailed message performed the best with

472
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
an additional three to four percent of

473
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
the verbose contacts patching

474
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,320
however under our statistical analysis

475
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
framework which is detailed more in the

476
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
paper we actually saw that this

477
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,839
difference was not statistically

478
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,040
significant

479
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
so there's actually still some

480
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,279
uncertainty about how impactful detail

481
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,519
is on a notification's effectiveness

482
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,560
finally

483
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
when we looked at language

484
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
we translated the message for contacts

485
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,839
in four different countries germany

486
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
netherlands poland and russia so for

487
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
half of the contacts in the country they

488
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,040
would receive an english message and for

489
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,160
the other half they would receive a

490
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
translated message and these were

491
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,360
translated by native technical speakers

492
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
surprisingly we actually observed less

493
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
patching from the translated message and

494
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,959
this was actually rather surprising it

495
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
really stumped us for a while

496
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
we actually got our first insight into

497
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,920
why this might be the case when we

498
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,760
looked at some of the feedback provided

499
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,920
in the free form response section of the

500
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
surveys that i mentioned were in

501
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,360
the notifications

502
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,839
so essentially they say that they

503
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,160
expected an english message from a u.s

504
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,440
institute

505
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,519
and that our translated messages came

506
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,279
out as very suspicious like spam or

507
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,040
phishing

508
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,199
so that's a little bit unfortunate

509
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,959
but ultimately this is a rather limited

510
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,000
result

511
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,519
because we looked at only a small

512
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,199
handful of countries in a small handful

513
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
of languages so future work to

514
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
understand how language impacts

515
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
notification effectiveness needs to look

516
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
at more languages

517
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
in particular all of our languages are

518
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
european countries so to get a global

519
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,959
general sense of the effective language

520
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,680
we need to study more uh more global

521
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,639
languages

522
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,680
also

523
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,040
some of our comments

524
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,839
noticed that specifically we're a u.s

525
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,800
university so perhaps different senders

526
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
actually might see different results

527
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
when they translate the message as a

528
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
simple example perhaps some organization

529
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,079
with a much more international presence

530
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,320
such as google which has various

531
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
products in various languages

532
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,160
perhaps their notifications in a

533
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
translated if they sent translated

534
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,839
messages perhaps that would come off as

535
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,279
a lot less suspicious so there's more

536
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,880
work that can be done in this particular

537
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,199
space

538
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
so one more result i want to present and

539
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,320
there's a lot more in the paper is one

540
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,680
that we didn't actually recently think

541
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,279
of asking but came to light when we

542
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,199
looked at our data and that is when you

543
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,959
send a notification when should you give

544
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,399
up hope that they're not going to do

545
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,440
anything

546
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
it's a little bit depressing

547
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
but let me first describe what is the

548
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
graph that i'm going to describe or show

549
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
here so this is going to be a graph for

550
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
ipv6 the whois verbose group but it

551
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,440
actually generalizes to all of our

552
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
different groups that saw notifications

553
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
having impact

554
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
this graph will show from day to day

555
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,920
their change in the percent of the

556
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
population that fixed compared to the

557
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,280
previous day so everything is relative

558
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
to the previous day so you can think of

559
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,280
it as a daily remediation rather than an

560
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
aggregate remediation amount

561
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,079
so here we show

562
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,319
the results we see that on the first day

563
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,760
there's a lot of remediation and on the

564
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,880
second day there's also a lot of

565
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
remediation but this is drastically dr

566
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
uh drastically decreasing day to day and

567
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,760
by day four essentially this has tailed

568
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,000
off and there we do not see any improved

569
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
remediation the fact that there is still

570
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,679
a little bit of remediation left is not

571
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,440
actually indicating further remediation

572
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
due to notifications but this is likely

573
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
uh just natural network churn because

574
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
this actually matches the level observed

575
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
in the control group

576
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,400
so we see that notifications effect

577
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,320
essentially lasts roughly three or four

578
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
days uh if you notify somebody and they

579
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,919
don't do anything within the first four

580
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
or five days essentially uh we can't

581
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
expect from what we saw you should not

582
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
expect anything else to happen

583
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,320
uh somewhat contrasting to what was

584
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
presented in the previous talk we also

585
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,120
did a re-notification where we sent a

586
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
second round of notifications about a

587
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
month later for still vulnerable hosts

588
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,240
and we actually did not see any

589
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
improvements in the remediation rate on

590
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,120
this second round of notifications so

591
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
this indicated to us that uh whatever

592
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
hurdles or challenges were blocking the

593
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,600
operators in the first case for

594
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,799
resolving the security issue are

595
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
persistent whether it be that they have

596
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,360
the wrong

597
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
whether we contact the wrong contacts uh

598
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,919
whether they lack the capabilities or

599
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,200
the permissions to take action or

600
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
whether they felt in their opinion that

601
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
it wasn't worth dealing with this issue

602
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,919
our second round of notifications did

603
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,640
not convince them otherwise

604
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,799
so speaking of opinions uh the other

605
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,000
thing that we looked at was the

606
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
reactions that we got to our

607
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,200
notifications trying to understand

608
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,039
whether they were well received or not

609
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
so we look at this both at the email

610
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
responses that we get back from our

611
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,679
notifications as well as the survey

612
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,360
feedback

613
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,039
so from the email responses we received

614
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,840
a total of 685 email responses of which

615
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
the vast majority were automated

616
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
responses we did receive a large number

617
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
of bounces as well as a number of human

618
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,320
responses

619
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,840
when we look at the human responses we

620
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
did a very simple sentiment analysis to

621
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
look at what was characterized in the

622
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
human responses and we saw that the vast

623
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
majority of them were positive over 76

624
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
percent of them explicitly thanked us or

625
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,360
expressed appreciation for our

626
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,039
notification and detection effort which

627
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
was good about 19 were neutral they

628
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,679
didn't express any particular sentiment

629
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
for example asking for more information

630
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
and we've received a small number of

631
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,360
negative messages uh about four percent

632
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,880
uh in all cases though none of these

633
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
notifications or none of these responses

634
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
were extremely negative uh no one

635
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,440
threatened to sue us no one threatened

636
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,039
to attack us no one threatened to report

637
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
us to some institute so we consider that

638
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,919
a win

639
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,240
in all cases it was actually uh they

640
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
simply requested that

641
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
they not be included in future detection

642
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
and notification rounds

643
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
when we looked at the survey our survey

644
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,600
was a rather simple seven question

645
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,400
seven question yes no answer uh survey

646
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
uh and the survey itself as well as our

647
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,039
emails are in the appendix of our paper

648
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,840
uh we actually received 57 responses now

649
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,039
while it's a seven question survey i

650
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,240
just want to highlight three of the

651
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,280
answers

652
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,240
so when we asked whether it was

653
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
acceptable to detect the vast majority

654
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
said it was okay

655
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
as did the vast majority for

656
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
notification and again

657
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
most of them indicated that they would

658
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
like to receive future notifications

659
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
now there is certainly a likely bias

660
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
here of those who responded to our

661
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,880
surveys

662
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,640
so most likely at the extremes of either

663
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,159
opinions either extremely positive or

664
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,600
extremely negative responding but this

665
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
is this does give us a sense that

666
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
overall notifications were relatively

667
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
well received of course there is a large

668
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,280
portion a sizeable portion of the

669
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,679
population that did not appreciate the

670
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
notification so moving forward if

671
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,039
notifications are to become a thing of

672
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
the future we do as a community need to

673
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,880
determine how actually best to do this

674
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
notification process while respecting

675
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
everyone's wishes

676
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,679
so looking forward i think there's a lot

677
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,960
of different things that we can move

678
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,280
forward in this space uh first i want to

679
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
recap some of the insights that we've

680
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
gained from this particular study so

681
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
we've seen that notifications can have a

682
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,640
statistically significant impact and it

683
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
can be well received we saw that about

684
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
an additional 10 to 15 percent of the

685
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,600
population actually fixed an issue

686
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
additionally the vast majority

687
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
provided positive feedback

688
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,480
from what our experiment showed we

689
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,440
observed that if you were to do

690
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
notifications today the best result

691
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
would come if you did uh whois verbose

692
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
notification so for both very detailed

693
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
messages sent to the whois contact uh

694
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
for a given vulnerable host

695
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
but something that i've been kind of

696
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
hiding under the rug to not spoil the

697
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,000
details although

698
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
ben's talk already discussed it is that

699
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
ultimately notification's impact was

700
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,919
actually rather limited on one hand we

701
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
did have a statistically significant

702
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
impact and it is a rather sizable

703
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,600
population that did fix the issue 10 to

704
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
15

705
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
but ultimately that's a very small

706
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
minority and you'd ideally like a vast

707
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,240
majority of the contacts actually deal

708
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
with the issue and we only saw a small

709
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
number

710
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,240
so i think there are some next steps

711
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
that we can take to move forward in

712
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,679
improving this

713
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
so first is more research on important

714
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,120
notification factors uh our study as

715
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
well as the previous one

716
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,559
essentially just scratched the surface

717
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
of the factors that can be explored and

718
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
even the q and a session are just before

719
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
already brought up some issues such as

720
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,480
how do you frame the message how do you

721
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,919
present the message so that it might be

722
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,280
more formal or it might look more

723
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
business-like there are other things to

724
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,280
explore such as can you include

725
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,520
incentive mechanisms that convince an

726
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
operator to actually take action

727
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,559
uh also you can look at other

728
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
notification channels uh

729
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,080
it's a little extreme but perhaps phone

730
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,159
calls uh some kind of using some kind of

731
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,520
application particularly if you're an

732
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
organization that has like say some

733
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
mobile app contacting them through that

734
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
so there's a lot more that can be done

735
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,159
to look at whether certain notification

736
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,520
factors have a significant impact

737
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,720
because we see that in some cases the

738
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,559
factors do actually impact the

739
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,919
effectiveness of the notification

740
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,840
significantly

741
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,240
also another need that our community has

742
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,320
and again it might be a bit less of a

743
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,039
research oriented goal is to establish a

744
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
reliable security point of contact for

745
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,720
various hosts

746
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,640
as ben stock already pointed out they

747
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
explicitly saw that a large number of

748
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
contacts were not the appropriate

749
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,919
contacts or

750
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,440
they were not able to reach the large

751
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,280
majority of the contacts and for us we

752
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,120
also saw that for many of our contacts

753
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,080
they did not appear to be the

754
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
appropriate points of contact to

755
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,600
actually take action so indeed a need

756
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,919
for a reliable point of contact where we

757
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,240
can actually send them security issues

758
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
would be highly beneficial and for those

759
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
of you who are thinking that abuse

760
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
contacts are already there for that we

761
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
actually got feedback in our survey

762
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,200
where people would actually say like

763
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,880
while the abuse contact is very similar

764
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
to a security contact it's for active

765
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
abuse not for vulnerabilities where no

766
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,480
abuse has actually happened so indeed

767
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
there's already some idea here that

768
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,480
there is a need for a different point of

769
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
contact

770
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
a final thing i wanted to point out is a

771
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,240
need for improving the centralized

772
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
notification mechanism so ideally the

773
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
search would have served as this where

774
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
you can just send them your

775
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
vulnerability information and they would

776
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,039
propagate this all to the proper parties

777
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,960
but we've seen that while they do

778
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
improve remediation

779
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
ultimately they also don't get the

780
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
majority of contacts to fix an issue

781
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,159
so some establishment of either an

782
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,360
improvement to the search or some

783
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
different organization that serves as a

784
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
central point where a researcher can

785
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,039
simply send all this information to them

786
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,480
i would be highly beneficial because it

787
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
would significantly reduce the overhead

788
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,320
of performing these notification

789
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
campaigns uh while they're doable if you

790
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,320
want to contact all the who is contacts

791
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
for example they certainly are very

792
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,039
expensive

793
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,240
so i believe that taking steps like

794
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,880
these moving forward will help us better

795
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
understand and gain some insights into

796
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
answering that original question which i

797
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
brought up which is how do you get those

798
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
that are affected by a security issue to

799
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
actually remediate and fix the issue so

800
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,840
we can improve the state of the security

801
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,760
on the internet all right thank you very

802
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,260
much and i'm happy to take any questions

803
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:52,619
[Applause]

804
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,720
and for our speaker

805
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,360
please come to the microphone

806
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
right so george jones this this may be

807
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
obvious but how would this all change in

808
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
a commercial context where there are

809
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,640
established relationships

810
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
oh yeah so actually some previous work

811
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
has looked at like this for uh for

812
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
google for example and we've seen that

813
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
actually when you have this business

814
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,279
relationship or some other kind of

815
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,360
relationship established uh beforehand

816
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,720
notifications have proven extremely

817
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,320
effective and this kind of goes to my

818
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
point about establishing a reliable

819
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
point of contact in those cases because

820
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
you already have this existing

821
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
relationship uh you can have a reliable

822
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,520
point of contact and get your message to

823
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,200
them so

824
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
while this has been done from more of a

825
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
research standpoint especially for

826
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,679
organizations who can establish a

827
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,960
reliable point of context i think

828
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
notifications uh can be extremely

829
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
effective right right i believe the poc

830
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,559
would not be such an issue but the study

831
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,480
of the remediation the effectiveness

832
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,159
even within commercial organizations oh

833
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,360
yeah certainly

834
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
uh i think revealing yeah certainly like

835
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,200
for example if google were to do uh

836
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,559
these kind of notifications looking at

837
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,720
how a language affects is certainly just

838
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
one example that would be interesting to

839
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,240
look at

840
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,400
all right bill solely uh thank you nice

841
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,200
talk

842
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
um so uh have you noticed any

843
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,120
correlation between the remediation

844
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,840
rates and the size of the

845
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,799
organization uh so we didn't look at

846
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
this in detail and in part because it's

847
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,559
sometimes hard to see how large the

848
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,240
organization is or like what kind of

849
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
metrics uh you would actually evaluate

850
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
an organization by especially in an

851
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
automated large-scale fashion this is

852
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,720
something i think would be really

853
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
interesting to look at in future work

854
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,919
and perhaps there is actually thing in

855
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,600
our data that we can analyze but we

856
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
didn't look at it for this current study

857
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440
maybe the number of ip addresses that

858
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
are publicly yeah you could look at

859
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,640
perhaps the ip address base for example

860
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,799
thank you

861
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,840
did you consider using uh social

862
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,679
networks to uh find uh points of contact

863
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,400
uh so did we think of it it came to mind

864
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
we did not obviously we did not study it

865
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,600
and that's actually one of the things i

866
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
think is interesting to look at for

867
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,880
future work in terms of different

868
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
notification factors certainly for

869
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,279
example uh social media such as like

870
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,679
using twitter has at times proven to be

871
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,600
a very reliable channel or a very quick

872
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,679
channel to catch somebody's attention

873
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,039
that one's a little particularly

874
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,400
challenging because if you start with an

875
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
ip address of a vulnerable host the

876
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,159
question is how do you tie this to

877
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,919
say a twitter account

878
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,440
in some cases this might be relatively

879
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,559
straightforward for like a large

880
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,480
organization or a large website perhaps

881
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,320
like for example if you found a very

882
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,720
common top 100 website you can find

883
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,399
their twitter account associated with it

884
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,760
but when you want to do this at large

885
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
scale for like the tail end of the less

886
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
popular ip addresses

887
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
it's unclear exactly how you do this but

888
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
i think certainly it's an interesting

889
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
domain to look forward we've had some

890
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
success with uh linkedin

891
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,559
linkedin okay

892
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
cool

893
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,559
so i have a quick question right before

894
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,720
we finish so i was curious about those

895
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
people that

896
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,960
requested to not be scanned and to not

897
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,480
be notified i mean isn't that kind of

898
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,039
like a head in the sand like i don't

899
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,080
want to know about anything approach or

900
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,360
um

901
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
i mean i think at least at this point we

902
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,279
don't really know their underlying

903
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,279
motivations for those requests perhaps

904
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,320
they feel

905
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
that this might be violating their

906
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,919
privacy or perhaps they feel like we're

907
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,120
actually attacking the network by

908
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,600
detecting these security issues uh it's

909
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,240
not totally clear but uh certainly since

910
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,600
they requested it we respected their

911
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,640
wishes

912
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,440
good and do you think that sorry

913
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,360
did you have any cases of people that

914
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
refused to believe your reports like

915
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
that weren't just negative like don't

916
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,520
scan me but that were like no you're

917
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,120
wrong there's nothing

918
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,039
vulnerable here so in this case we do

919
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,720
see a small handful of people who say oh

920
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,399
i don't believe i have this issue and

921
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,600
then we'll double check our data and

922
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,039
then we'll send them what we have and

923
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,240
then

924
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
invariably has turned out that

925
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,399
indeed was an issue yeah so it seems

926
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,320
that this is a social problem as much as

927
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
kind of anything right yeah so this

928
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
actually brings up some of the other

929
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
factors i can look at such as uh we've

930
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
thought of before perhaps providing some

931
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,600
way for them to validate them this

932
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
themselves easily like for example web

933
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,840
interface like for example for harpley

934
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,200
there were things where you could check

935
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,120
easily if your server was vulnerable and

936
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,039
provide perhaps providing such a similar

937
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
interface in our notifications would

938
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,159
also make these more effective as well

939
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,919
cool well let's thank our speaker one

940
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,540
more time thank you

941
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,240
[Applause]

942
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,320
you
