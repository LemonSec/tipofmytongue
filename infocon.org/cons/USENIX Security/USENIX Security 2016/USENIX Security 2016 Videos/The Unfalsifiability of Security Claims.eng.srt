1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,440
green

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,040
and we're live

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,079
so um the unfalsifiability of security

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,560
claims um

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
it sort of seemed to me for quite some

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
time that there's something a little bit

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
wrong in security there's there's

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
there's something that funny things keep

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
popping up and it manifests itself in

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
different ways um but i don't think i'm

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
alone in that um

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
in that feeling here's um adi shamir um

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
making 10-year predictions and receiving

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
the turing award in 2002 and he said

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,960
among other things blah blah blah

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
non-crypto security will remain a mess

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
and if you were to fault him on this

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
prediction i think you know you would

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,960
probably fault him that he didn't extend

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
it beyond the 10-year prediction that

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,039
we're in a mess in in many different

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
ways and sometimes it pops up in

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,680
in in

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
small things that don't make um much

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
sense or things that don't jive with

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
others and let me just give you one or

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
two small examples of the very small

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
things but i think they add up to

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
something that is um

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
that points to a a a a problem upstream

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,400
in our thinking

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
so this is from something um a use next

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
paper that i and some colleagues had um

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
a couple of years ago on on on on

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
passwords and

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
um

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,759
when

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,720
when people are asked to choose

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
passwords we tell them well you should

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
choose a password that's random and

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799
strong and stuff like that and you

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,479
should never reuse them across account

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,040
okay that that sounds good so

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
i have about 100 different accounts at

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,240
least and i think that's not an uncommon

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
experience so if i'd said 40 bits per

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,360
password times 100 is 4 000 plus a

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
couple of bits for um bookkeeping and

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
stuff that gives you four and a half

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
thousand random bits that you have to

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,200
remember

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,960
i don't do this you don't do this the

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,479
people who wrote this advice don't do

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,320
this because it's pretty much impossible

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,079
the human brain cannot memorize four and

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,079
a half thousand random bits

57
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
um

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,719
another kind of

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
it was a very small example but a couple

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,920
of years ago this guy jacob nielsen

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
um

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,560
who's a usability and design expert guy

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,440
and he

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,639
doesn't usually talk about security

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,840
stuff but he popped up and he said you

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,959
know i think this business about doing

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
password masking this um you know

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,959
blocking out putting in asterisks

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
instead of showing the password i think

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
this is a waste of time and it it does

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
more harm than good and that was fine

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
you expect guys like that to say stuff

73
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,840
like that and then schneier um you know

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
saw this and on his blog said something

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
i agree with this i think this is a good

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
idea and then there was an epic flame

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
war in the blogosphere people pop up and

78
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
slashed off and they're calling each

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,959
other names and arguing whether it's

80
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,480
secure or not secure and stuff like that

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
and then two weeks later schneider

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
blogged about it again and essentially

83
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,879
reversed himself and he wrote um so was

84
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,800
i wrong maybe

85
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
okay probably

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,519
so

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,720
so what's the right answer yes no

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,879
maybe i mean there are many complicated

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,160
questions in computer security but this

90
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,280
isn't one of them this is something that

91
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
in principle basically has a binary

92
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
answer is it doing good or is it not

93
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
doing good and

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,480
without um and i think it's worse than

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,959
not only do we not know the answer here

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
we don't know how to find the answer

97
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,519
suppose for example all the funding

98
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
agencies said forget all the all the

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
stuff you're working on right now i want

100
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
an answer to this question and stop

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,360
doing everything else until you can

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
answer this do we know how to answer

103
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,239
this question what would we do what

104
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
experiment or what analysis would we do

105
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
to definitively answer this question and

106
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
i don't think we know the answer and if

107
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,879
we can't answer something as simple and

108
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,560
as binary as this there's something

109
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
profoundly broken upstream in our logic

110
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
in the way we reason in the way we

111
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,319
reason about problems

112
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
so why why do we end up insisting on the

113
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
necessity of things that are provably

114
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,879
impossible that 30 seconds worth of

115
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,239
arithmetic will tell you that you can't

116
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159
choose a random password and never reuse

117
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
across 100 accounts unless you use some

118
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,519
other

119
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,599
technology to assist you how do we end

120
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
up not being able to not just you know

121
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
figure out the answer but not even able

122
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,360
to figure out how do we figure out the

123
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
answer on something that is basically a

124
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
simple binary question and that's that's

125
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
basically what i want to get to is i

126
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,319
think that there's something there's

127
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
something very broken in our logic and

128
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
if we can get to it maybe we can solve

129
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,040
some of these problems and advance on

130
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
things where we've we've not made

131
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
progress

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
so

133
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
in reading a bunch um

134
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,840
on

135
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,360
uh how people approach security i mean i

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
read a bunch of things and one of the

137
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
things um

138
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
i started reading some on science of

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
securing there's a good paper by um fred

140
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
schneider on blueprint for um

141
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
a science of cyber security which

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
appeared in the

143
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
nsa journal or magazine

144
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
a couple of years ago and the very first

145
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,720
sentence in the um in the paper says a

146
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
secure system must defend against all

147
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
possible attacks including those unknown

148
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,280
to the defender and that's something

149
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
that you know basically you know has

150
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
that has a ring of truth to it but i got

151
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,479
stuck

152
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,919
and i got stuck

153
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,720
not

154
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
not on whether this is true or not i got

155
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,320
stuck on something even more basic than

156
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
that and i got stuck on

157
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
is this a definition or a claim

158
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
are you defining security to be this way

159
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
are you claiming that you have found it

160
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
to be this way that sounds like a

161
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
philosophical distinction but it's not

162
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,919
it's actually a very important it's

163
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,520
actually a very important question so by

164
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
which i mean the following

165
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
are you saying i define

166
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
that my definition of a secure system is

167
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
one which defends against all possible

168
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
attacks that's that's what secure means

169
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,759
it means that nothing else or are you

170
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
saying that when i went out into the

171
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,400
world and i saw all these systems

172
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,960
those that i found to be secure had the

173
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
property that they always defended

174
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
against all these attacks which of these

175
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
two things you're saying because they're

176
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
very different statements

177
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,039
and

178
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
in addition to it's important which of

179
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,680
these

180
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
um are you saying no matter which of

181
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,759
these two you're saying i think there's

182
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,880
a serious problem because um

183
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
definitions don't describe the world

184
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
you can't mean you can you can define

185
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
security to be anything you want but

186
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
that doesn't

187
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
give us any useful statement for the

188
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
anticipation of experience

189
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
and if this is a claim so if it's a

190
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
definition it really doesn't help us

191
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
make useful statements about how the

192
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
world is and how to anticipate what we

193
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
will get when we when we use things

194
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
and if you're saying you have found

195
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
security to be this way if it's a claim

196
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
it's a non-falsifiable claim

197
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,919
and let me show you uh exactly why so it

198
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
claims of necessary conditions and this

199
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
is basically the the um the the sort of

200
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,639
the main thing that i'm i'm i'm building

201
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
around here sorry the graphics are

202
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,960
rendering not not super um super well uh

203
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,199
here but claims of necessary conditions

204
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
for security are unfalsifiable a

205
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
necessary condition just you know your

206
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
um

207
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
um

208
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,479
revision of set theory uh x is the

209
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
necessary condition for y if x is a

210
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
superset of y

211
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
and i'm going to say why is the set of

212
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,800
things

213
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
the systems that are secure or the

214
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
passwords that are secure the set of

215
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,479
techniques that are secure

216
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
by which i mean bad outcomes will be

217
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
avoided so if if um why is if this is

218
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
the space of passwords why would be the

219
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
space of passwords which avoid bad

220
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
outcomes due to guessing attacks or

221
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
something like that so why is you are

222
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
secure why

223
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
not y is otherwise

224
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
and the claim is no observation will

225
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
ever falsify the claim that you have a

226
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
necessary condition that x is necessary

227
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
for y that is that x is a superset of y

228
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
and proof is one line to falsify the

229
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
claim that x is a superset of y you must

230
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,199
show that um

231
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,400
not x intersection y is not empty

232
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
but you can't find anything in y we

233
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
agree that you can't observe that

234
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
something is secure you can't look at a

235
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
system and say

236
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
yes the system is secure you can see

237
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
that it's not secure if you see a

238
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,039
successful attack but you cannot see

239
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,960
that it actually is secure you can look

240
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
at a password and say no that's not

241
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
secure i know it's on a dictionary but

242
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
you can't say yes this is secure it's

243
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
going to survive so you can't observe

244
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
that something is in y and that is what

245
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,599
you need to do in order to demon to

246
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,199
falsify a claim that something is

247
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
necessary for for

248
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
to be in in this set so in words

249
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
falsifying the claim that x is necessary

250
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,039
for security requires finding something

251
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,800
secure that doesn't do x and if you

252
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
agree that you can't find something

253
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,720
that's secure you just can't do it okay

254
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
so that's that's um

255
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
so if it's a claim it's an unfalsifiable

256
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
claim and we'll look at what that means

257
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,440
and why it's a problem in in a moment if

258
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
it's a definition well definitions don't

259
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,919
describe the world i can say here's i

260
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,639
define security to be i define it to be

261
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,680
anything i want the systems that um

262
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
you know defend against all possible

263
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
attacks for example let's say the people

264
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
who use only secure systems live in here

265
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
and the people who do anything else live

266
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
out there well what's divide the

267
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
population into those two sets now

268
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
what's the strongest statement that i

269
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
can make about the difference in

270
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
experienced outcomes between these two

271
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
sets i actually can't say anything a

272
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
definition doesn't allow me to do

273
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
anything is the average case better you

274
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,559
can't say that is representative case

275
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
better is at least one case better can

276
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
you rule out the possibility that

277
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
there's no difference no you can't make

278
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
any of these statements you've just got

279
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,720
a definition and you can a definition is

280
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
not going to allow you to discover

281
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,640
properties of the world so

282
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
that original statement it's either a

283
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,680
claim

284
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,480
um or a definition and if it's a claim

285
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
it's an unfalsifiable one now

286
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
when i when i

287
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,000
present this analysis and this is like

288
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
one line of algebra here when i present

289
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
people with this that this observation

290
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,480
people

291
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,920
probably have their have the reaction

292
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
that you are probably now having which

293
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
is you suspect sophistry you think that

294
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,880
there's something philosophical going on

295
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
here with words and you have an

296
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
engineers

297
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
healthy distrust for philosophy you

298
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
expect that there's some fancy tap

299
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
dancing going on and this is something

300
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
that can be made to go away and you were

301
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,360
already probably thinking of the no no

302
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
no no no no what i mean when i say

303
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
secure is something else i've got a way

304
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,279
of making this go away and

305
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,560
and there are various approaches to that

306
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,760
i call them basically um denial anger

307
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
bargaining depression and we have to go

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
through those before we can get to

309
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
acceptance and i think it's it's it's a

310
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
it's um so i want to just go through

311
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,399
quickly to convince you that each of the

312
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,160
escape hatches that you are probably

313
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,839
already thinking of to get out of this

314
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,519
difficulty

315
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,200
get you nowhere they just get you back

316
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
into the same problem of either making

317
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,079
tautological definition statements are

318
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,600
unfalsifiable

319
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
and empirical statements and there's no

320
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
escape from this fundamental problem

321
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
that we have here and that i want to

322
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,560
convince you that this is something that

323
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
you you we need to grapple with it so so

324
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,760
the basically denial anger bargaining

325
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
and depression are security by design

326
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,680
goals claiming that insecurity is the

327
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
possibility of bad outcomes whether

328
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
those bad outcomes are instantiated or

329
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
not that security is is a property to be

330
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
proved rather than one to be observed

331
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,680
and finally that security is a

332
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,200
non-binary property that you know

333
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,959
somehow in in doing the set theory stuff

334
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
i've kind of built in a binary

335
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
assumption that is that that is not

336
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,519
appropriate so let me just go through

337
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
them one slide each and j just to kind

338
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
of quickly convince you that um that

339
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
these go nowhere so security by design

340
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,880
goal is saying no no no i mean security

341
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,320
um is not a statement about a particular

342
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
set of outcomes is security is to be

343
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
understood relative to a threat model or

344
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,760
set of design goals i have some

345
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
understanding of what the world of

346
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,959
attackers out there can do i have some

347
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,399
understanding of their capabilities and

348
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
based on their capabilities i build in a

349
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,760
set of countermeasures and my security

350
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
is either achieving or not achieving um

351
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
that set of counter measures so i have a

352
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
certain set of um goals so let's call

353
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,240
them

354
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
you know these x0 x1 x2 blah blah blah

355
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
and then i'm secure when i achieve the

356
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
intersection of all those design goals

357
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
and those design goals are informed by

358
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,399
what i know about attackers now this

359
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,279
certainly this set is very different

360
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
from the the set the unfalsifiable set

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
that i talked about before we couldn't

362
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
observe that something was secure in the

363
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
sense of forbidding future bad outcomes

364
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
but we can certainly observe that these

365
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,519
design goals have been met so now we're

366
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,120
dealing with a much more tractable

367
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
animal and that's that's um that's

368
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,959
really good

369
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
but did we actually solve the problem or

370
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
or or did we just kind of um sweep it

371
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
under the carpet well

372
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
what can we say about this this set of

373
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,000
um

374
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,760
achieving this design goals um well

375
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
how can i know that achieving my design

376
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
goals is sufficient to keep my stuff

377
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
from experiencing bad outcomes well

378
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
the claim that it is sufficient is

379
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
immediately falsifiable in the sense

380
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,279
that if your goals are if your defenses

381
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
are not sufficient you get to see that

382
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
when the bad guy succeeds in a

383
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
particular attack that is to say you

384
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
observe something that is in the

385
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
intersection you achieved your design

386
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
goals that

387
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
it's an element of this set yg but it's

388
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
not you did not manage to make it to

389
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
your desired uh place in y which is

390
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
secure against bad outcomes um so that's

391
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,360
that's um uh it's easy to see when

392
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
things are not sufficient however how do

393
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
i check that the design goals that i

394
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
built in are actually necessary

395
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,880
well i'm back at the problem that i

396
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
started with there's nothing that will

397
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
ever make me um

398
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,519
be able to falsify whether a goal is

399
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,519
necessary i picked some some set of

400
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,040
design goals based on an understanding

401
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
of the world suppose i was wrong about

402
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
one of those things it's actually not

403
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
necessary and i built it in there is no

404
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
observation and there is no analysis

405
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,600
that i can possibly perform that will

406
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,959
illustrate that i've made an error i'm

407
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
just going to live with that design goal

408
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,240
that is that is unnecessary so that the

409
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,160
goals are sufficient is falsifiable but

410
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
the claim that is necessary is not in

411
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,399
other words all i've done is

412
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,480
it's not quite turtles all the way down

413
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
but i started with a problem and i put

414
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
one more turtle under it um meaning you

415
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,800
know i ended up

416
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
back with the same difficulty that i

417
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
started out from we still can't falsify

418
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,760
the claim that things are actually

419
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,320
necessary if we can't observe something

420
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
in the in in the set where we're

421
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,079
we're seeking for

422
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
so how about insecurity is the

423
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,279
possibility of bad outcomes i don't mean

424
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
a bad thing will happen i mean a bad

425
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,839
thing can happen well okay

426
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,320
so let's let's look at the set let's

427
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
call it um to say bad outcomes cannot

428
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,920
happen so if i get that that will be um

429
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,079
let's consider this set and k you know

430
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,760
not k otherwise um this is so k is is

431
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,199
the um

432
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,040
the the blue thing here and y was the

433
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
the original one that i started with

434
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
well

435
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,920
clearly everything

436
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,519
that can happen

437
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,880
will happen

438
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
so i'm sorry everything that will

439
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
captain can happen

440
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,519
so k

441
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,320
is going to be a subset of y and a

442
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
subset of y is not going to be of any

443
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
help whatsoever in um in helping me find

444
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,079
a superset of y and further since we

445
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
said it was impossible to find any

446
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,959
element of y well it must be impossible

447
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
to find l any element of k also so in

448
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,279
other words this is also um falsifying

449
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,959
the claim that

450
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,560
the claim that you found a necessary

451
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
condition for k is also unfalsifiable i

452
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,839
mean and if you write this down um i

453
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,000
mean people often sort of you know

454
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
use language and confuse the issue with

455
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
it but the claim that a bad outcome is

456
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
possible means that a bad outcome will

457
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
happen is equivalent if you kind of work

458
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
it out carefully to the statement that k

459
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,839
implies y that is um that something

460
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,079
can happen and therefore will happen

461
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
that k implies y means that not k

462
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,040
implies not y which if you recognize

463
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,079
from your boolean algebra classes um

464
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,160
is is just the the logical fallacy of

465
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,839
denying the antecedent it's claiming

466
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,360
that um

467
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
it's claiming that uh a it's confusing a

468
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
sufficient condition and a necessary one

469
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,360
that is x implies y does not mean not x

470
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
implies not y so for example if you say

471
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
defending against attack x

472
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,199
makes you safe from attack x it does not

473
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,040
follow it simply does not follow that if

474
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,880
you don't defend against attack x that

475
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,000
you will that you will succumb to it and

476
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,920
th this is something that i think we'll

477
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,240
we will um we'll keep coming back to so

478
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
for example i mean an explanation of

479
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,959
that that that that um

480
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
that puzzling observation that i

481
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
referenced at the top where we tell

482
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,320
people to chew you know never reuse

483
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
passwords across accounts and is you

484
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,720
know is password reuse the real threat

485
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,160
factor i mean do bad guys actually yes

486
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
yes yes they do do bad things happen

487
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
because of reuse and bad guys exploiting

488
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
this vector yes absolutely can we

489
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
eliminate that re that risk by avoiding

490
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,160
reuse yes yes you can does it follow

491
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
from a b and c that d that you should

492
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
never reuse passwords no no it does not

493
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
just simply as a matter of logic that

494
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
does not follow right what you're doing

495
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880
is it is a sufficient condition to

496
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,560
avoid any password reuse vector to um

497
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,079
to avoid reuse but that doesn't make it

498
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
a necessary one and confusing necessary

499
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
and sufficient is as as we'll see in a

500
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
couple of slides is getting us into a

501
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
lot of problems

502
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,399
so then

503
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,120
denial anger bargaining and proving

504
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
necessary conditions the claim that and

505
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
this is related to definitional or

506
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
tautological um

507
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,320
tautological statements but um

508
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
the claim that you have proved something

509
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,600
secure well when we have a proof right a

510
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,399
proof

511
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
is unfalsifiable um for less alarming

512
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,800
reasons than a than an empirical

513
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
observation but a proof can't be

514
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,199
contradicted by any possible observation

515
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
and if it can't be contradicted by any

516
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
observation then it's consistent with

517
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
every observation so it makes no promise

518
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
whatsoever about how the future is going

519
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,439
to look i mean a approved statement has

520
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,280
no ability to restrict how um

521
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,240
how the future is going to roll out

522
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
so basically when we make proof

523
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,679
statements when we try to do you know

524
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,559
provable security um or make proved

525
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,880
statements about say a password of a

526
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,640
certain um

527
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
um

528
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
of a certain format will stand up to

529
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
attacks of a certain type generally

530
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
speaking we have a proof but it doesn't

531
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
start with say you know euclid's axioms

532
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
it starts with some assumption about

533
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
attacker

534
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
about what the attacker can do and what

535
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,039
the attacker cannot do i think that's

536
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
key that we basically have

537
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
any model um

538
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
of

539
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,799
starts with

540
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
what a bad guy can do and what a bad guy

541
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
cannot do

542
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,919
but it's important to not lose sight of

543
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
there's a very important restriction on

544
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
the kinds of verification that we can

545
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
apply to what a bad guy can do and what

546
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,559
a bad guy cannot do the claim that a bad

547
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
guy can do something is verifiable you

548
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,880
can actually observe him doing it

549
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
the claim that a bad guy can do

550
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,640
something is not falsifiable if you

551
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
think that a bad guy can

552
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,799
compute logarithms in finite fields

553
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,880
there is no observation that will

554
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
falsify that claim and conversely

555
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
the claim that a bad guy cannot is

556
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
verifiable but can't be falsified and

557
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
losing track of these two will um will

558
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
let us leave it lead us into mischief

559
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,799
unless we're unless we're careful with

560
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
it then finally this one is really

561
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
quickly taken care of is um okay

562
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,320
security is in binary somehow i've done

563
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
some trickery here and i'm talking about

564
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,960
necessary things and no one really

565
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,679
believes security is a binary quality we

566
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,679
really understand that security is is

567
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,880
doing x is better than not doing x in

568
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,799
some sort of scalar sense well this

569
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
leads nowhere also because the problem

570
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,760
with with the binary security is we

571
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,440
don't have a test for security the

572
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
problem with treating security as a

573
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
scalar is we don't have a metric either

574
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,640
so the statement that the security of x

575
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
is greater than the security of not x

576
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,039
well how do you falsify this

577
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
how would you how would you how would

578
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
you falsify the statement that choosing

579
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,280
um

580
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
you know that any count that doing any

581
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,360
counter measure is um is more secure

582
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
than not doing that counter measure you

583
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,520
clearly can't do it by just saying okay

584
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
the observed outcomes are going to be

585
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
better because that's not always the

586
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
case for example the claim that um

587
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
you know the experience of people who

588
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
travel on a ship that happens not to

589
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
have life puts is in almost all

590
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
circumstances the same as the experience

591
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,799
of people

592
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,799
the travel on one that does have light

593
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,039
boats the observed experience doesn't

594
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,880
tell you whether it's it it isn't a good

595
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,320
guide to whether it's a it's an

596
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
advisable measure or not so we don't

597
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,360
have a test for security and we don't

598
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,480
have a metric for security and this um

599
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
this hugely complicates the kind of

600
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
statements that we can make so so just

601
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
to just to you know

602
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,400
summarize what we got

603
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
so far denial anger bargaining

604
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
depression it's so to summarize a

605
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
statement of the following form if you

606
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
don't do x then claim

607
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
if claim is you are not secured that is

608
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
unfalsifiable or tautological statement

609
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
for all x for all x if you say the claim

610
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
is instead a bad outcome will happen or

611
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
a bad outcome can happen that's

612
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,320
unfalsifiable or tautological for all x

613
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,600
and

614
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
and those are and that's problematic

615
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
being making unfalsifiable or are our

616
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
tautological statements are problematic

617
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,480
if you're going to use them to justify

618
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,600
measures now

619
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
so this is where where um i think is is

620
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
is where it starts to um

621
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
impact what it is we do is like a lot of

622
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,159
what we do in security we have to

623
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,320
decide on defensive measures to protect

624
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,600
things in other words we have a whole

625
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
series of things we say you should do x

626
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
you should choose a strong password you

627
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
should run antivirus you should do

628
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
regular updates and what i'm interested

629
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,880
in is what kind of evidence can i bring

630
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,039
to bear what is acceptable evidence to

631
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,919
convince you that x is actually a valid

632
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,159
counter measure and

633
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,720
making statements of this kind seem to

634
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,480
be these are really problematic

635
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
statements and i think as we dig into it

636
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,520
we will find that a lot of the

637
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
statements we make follow this format

638
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,679
and therefore are very problematic and

639
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
and therefore some of the things that we

640
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,679
insist upon are based on very um

641
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,640
um

642
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,559
very uh

643
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
not solid foundations

644
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
so an unfalsifiable claim i mean again

645
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
just to um you know just to emphasize it

646
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
unfalsifiable does not mean morally

647
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,039
wrong it does not mean it's incorrect it

648
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
does not mean it's false what it means

649
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
is nothing in the observable universe

650
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,679
depends upon the truth value of the

651
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,760
statement say i claim if you don't do x

652
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
then you are not secure

653
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
this is how the world looks if that

654
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
statement is true and this is how the

655
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,000
world looks if that statement is false

656
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,679
there is no difference in other words

657
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,760
you can search the entire planet earth

658
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
and measure everything on it to nine

659
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
decimal places for a million years and

660
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,679
you will never find anything that will

661
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,679
that will

662
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
definitively rule out the truth of that

663
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
statement in other words you're making a

664
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,480
statement about that is in

665
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
the truth of which is determined in an

666
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,039
unobservable realm

667
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,400
so

668
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
a reasonable reaction at this point is

669
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
like ah this is kind of highfalutin

670
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,720
stuff right this sounds very philosophy

671
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,360
this sounds very unfalsifiable i'm here

672
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
to fight real bad guys who do real

673
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
things what's this got to do with with

674
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
anything and with anything practical and

675
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
uh can't we just ignore this that's

676
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
that's a that's a valid question um

677
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,799
um no it is i mean it's it's it's um

678
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,880
so i want to convince you that no no no

679
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
that's not a valid um that's not a valid

680
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
approach at all consequences of

681
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
unfalsifiability the first concept was

682
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
self-correction is now one-sided if you

683
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,280
get things wrong you will you will stay

684
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
wrong if you if you are incorrect about

685
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,639
um

686
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,840
if you

687
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
underestimate the abilities of your

688
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
attacker you that underestimation will

689
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,120
become obvious to you when um when a

690
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
successful attack occurs however if you

691
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
overestimate them there is absolutely

692
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
nothing that the observable universe

693
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
will show you to confirm that fact the

694
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,520
second is when you confuse sufficient

695
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,440
conditions for necessary ones and you

696
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
cascade them you end up in an over

697
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,120
constrained problem space you end up

698
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
with things where you've decided that

699
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,559
you have to do a certain set of things

700
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
and it's actually an unsolvable problem

701
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
and worse you don't even you don't even

702
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
understand that it's an unsolvable

703
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
problem and

704
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
deciding how do we decide which

705
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
unfalsifiable claims we should follow up

706
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,440
on and and which not

707
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,279
so first of all self-correction is

708
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
one-sided um

709
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
new attacks can argue and new

710
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,960
observations can argue countermeasures

711
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,919
in nothing really argues one out so

712
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,600
assume much in the threat modeling

713
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
exercise we assume that an attacker has

714
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
capabilities c0 c1 blah blah blah blah

715
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,720
and based on that we decide on a set of

716
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
defensive measures um

717
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,840
um you know x0 x1 xn now

718
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,200
and i'm pretty happy with my set of

719
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,720
defensive measures and my stuff is there

720
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
and it's being protected if my set of

721
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
defensive measures are not sufficient

722
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,159
this will become clear when a bad guy

723
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,440
succeeds and i you know

724
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
in the morning my the money's all gone

725
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,039
from my bank account or or whatever bad

726
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,919
um

727
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,159
this happens when an attacker steps

728
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,520
outside of the model and shows you a

729
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
capability that you hadn't designed for

730
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
or didn't suspect so for example here's

731
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,039
a dog jumping over the fence and you

732
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,400
know well i didn't suspect that he could

733
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,640
jump that high that's what we're used to

734
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
the idea of scanning for the uh scanning

735
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
for the possibility that our defenses

736
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,559
are insufficient

737
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
what i'm trying to persuade you of there

738
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
is a second danger that we are really

739
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,760
not alert for which is that my defenses

740
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
have gone way beyond what is necessary

741
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,480
that and there is no possible

742
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
observation so to give you kind of an

743
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
analogy suppose i actually am trying to

744
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
build a fence to keep dogs in and

745
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,440
and

746
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
um i decide eight feet is the

747
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,000
the height of the fence to keep you know

748
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
uh german shepherds and things like that

749
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,120
in well if one day a german shepherd

750
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,799
manages to jump nine feet over the fence

751
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,320
i decide well that clearly was not

752
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
enough but suppose i

753
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
become ridiculously excessive and i say

754
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
20 feet every dog fence on the planet

755
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
should be 20 feet and people listen to

756
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
me and people

757
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
build that into standards and best

758
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
practices and stuff like that and every

759
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
chihuahua and pekingese and cargi owner

760
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,679
on the planet builds a 20-foot fence

761
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,880
there is no observation anywhere that

762
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,600
will illustrate the overkill that's gone

763
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
on here and suppose some rival guy says

764
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,120
i think that guy hurley with the 20 foot

765
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,720
fence is full of nonsense i've just used

766
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
10 feet fences everywhere and it works

767
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,240
fine well

768
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,159
there is no observation there is no

769
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,320
refutation for the claim you've just

770
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
been lucky so far sooner or later

771
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
somewhere down the line so there is

772
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
there is two kinds of danger here we're

773
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,600
much more familiar with the first kind

774
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
of danger is that you don't do enough

775
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,159
but if you do too much

776
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,320
there's no observation that will show

777
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
you that you've done too much and that

778
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
cost particularly if it's not a one-time

779
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,640
cost if it's an ongoing cost will stay

780
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
on the books forever so you've got to be

781
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
very very careful when you do these

782
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,039
things for the possibility that you're

783
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,960
overkilling so overkill is not

784
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,679
detectable is basically the observation

785
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,520
second confusing sufficient for

786
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
necessary i mean it seems reasonable in

787
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
security well you know we have to over

788
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,480
design we do some stuff you wouldn't

789
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,279
want to

790
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
fly in planes built by optimists and

791
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,760
stuff like that um and so i've got a

792
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
whole bunch of necessary suppose i've

793
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,000
got a whole bunch of necessary

794
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
conditions the problem with confusing

795
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
sufficient for necessary becomes clearer

796
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
when you consider a lot of conditions

797
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,440
and not just one or two

798
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
a necessary condition is a superset of

799
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,200
the set that i'm trying to achieve as

800
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,520
being secure and suppose i have you know

801
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
a dozen or 20 or 200 of these well the

802
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
intersection of a whole bunch of

803
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
supersets is still a superset of

804
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
whatever i was aiming for

805
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
but suppose instead of this i actually

806
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
confused i didn't have necessary

807
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,240
conditions because i've got no way of

808
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,679
truly checking that i have a necessary

809
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,279
condition i actually have sufficient

810
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,360
conditions well sufficient conditions

811
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,240
are subsets not super sets and being in

812
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
a subset um

813
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
i mean when you cascade them the

814
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
intersection of a whole bunch of

815
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
arbitrary subsets of y isn't even

816
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
guaranteed to be non-empty

817
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,720
in other words i can i've convinced

818
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
myself that i have necessary conditions

819
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,559
they're not necessary conditions they're

820
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
actually sufficient conditions and when

821
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,159
i cascade them there is actually no

822
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,840
solution to the problem that i'm seeking

823
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
which i think is exactly what happened

824
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,279
with this password reuse case here is

825
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,320
that somehow we said i i start with one

826
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,600
password and now i have a second

827
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,919
password and say well if you reuse

828
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,919
there's um there's a risk that a bad guy

829
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,480
will get it so i replace what is a

830
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
sufficient condition and consider it

831
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,720
necessary and then i

832
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,840
iterate out to 100 or 200 or whatever

833
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
number of passwords and i end up with an

834
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
unsolvable problem without even

835
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
realizing that that's what i've done so

836
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,559
there's a real danger here there's real

837
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,320
danger when there's cost in each of the

838
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,200
um

839
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,279
the counter measures and then finally

840
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,720
it's not usually mentioned in polite

841
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,600
society but i'm not a polite guy and and

842
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,039
and so the word of unfalsifiability is i

843
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,480
mean you know i don't want to be too

844
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
antagonistic but this is essentially the

845
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
demarcation line that

846
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
the rest of the scientific community

847
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,960
places between things that are

848
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
scientific and things that are not

849
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,039
scientific this is the the criterion you

850
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,799
know that this guy popper came up with

851
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,880
to demarcate things like the pursuit of

852
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,640
witchcraft and the spoonbenders and the

853
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,120
cargo guys and the paranormal people

854
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
from the stuff that the rest of us

855
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,120
recognizes science so so

856
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,320
i i i'm not um i'm not um

857
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,440
going across this line may sometimes be

858
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,679
necessary but you know it is not

859
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,840
something to be done in a blase fashion

860
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,200
and doing it without realizing that

861
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,360
that's what we've been doing has serious

862
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,200
consequences and don't have um have um

863
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
and we need to kind of address and

864
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
grapple with them so is that what i'm

865
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,960
saying is that is that the punch line of

866
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
the talk i mean it basically i came here

867
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,559
to call people names and say computer

868
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,320
science security is pseudoscience blah

869
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,960
blah blah um well no that's not the

870
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,399
punch line and actually i don't believe

871
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,159
that that that is the case i mean

872
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
because if you look at something like

873
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,320
the astrology and you know the trying to

874
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,080
figure out people's character or from

875
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,399
you know the the cranial bumps and stuff

876
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,360
like that

877
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
that stuff is just pure nonsense there

878
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,880
is no there is no basis whatever to it

879
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
if you take stuff like this this you

880
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
know and no one has made more fun of of

881
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,320
these you know and stupid password rules

882
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,720
probably than i have um

883
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
this is this is you know not

884
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,559
particularly um

885
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,640
well thought out or well justified but

886
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
it's not based on nothing this is based

887
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,799
on some particular model it's not like

888
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,919
it's not like the um you know witchcraft

889
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,760
and astrology and things like that

890
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,440
there's something behind it there's a

891
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,919
falsifiable claim behind it it's just

892
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,320
that we're not pre it's not presented

893
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,360
here

894
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,240
and this is based on some model of the

895
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
world which may or may not be accurate

896
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,559
and that's i think what the problem is

897
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,000
is that not that we're doing things that

898
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,399
are out and out pseudoscientific it's

899
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,120
that

900
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,919
um behind the statements that are not

901
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
strongly justifiable are more

902
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,320
justifiable statements but they're of a

903
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,200
different character than um

904
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,039
um

905
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,200
than what we actually say so finally

906
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,760
okay denial anger bargaining depression

907
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,559
and acceptance i think once once you're

908
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
convinced that okay making unfalsifiable

909
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,799
claims has a cost to it and i don't want

910
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,159
to do that so i want to get on the right

911
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
side of this so

912
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,279
the the final answer is okay okay i

913
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,120
didn't mean it so literally don't be so

914
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,279
literal about it when i said this you

915
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,480
know when i said that something is

916
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,399
necessary for security i meant to

917
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,480
improve things in some way when i said

918
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
the security of x is better than the

919
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,159
security of not x i didn't mean um i

920
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,880
didn't mean to invoke an unfalsifiable

921
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
statement like that what i meant is to

922
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
say the outcome in certain circumstances

923
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
will be better if you do x than if you

924
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,679
do not x so the outcome given given a b

925
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,120
c d

926
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
is better when you do x than when you

927
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
don't do x for some assumptions a b c

928
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,240
and d okay so that that actually starts

929
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,360
to get us

930
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,960
moving in the right direction this

931
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
actually has you know puts us making

932
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,519
claims that are falsifiable and good and

933
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
healthy and you know we can you know not

934
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,919
feel um not feel we're on the wrong side

935
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,360
of a stark line like um unfalsifiability

936
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,519
but let's not pat ourselves on the back

937
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,960
um

938
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
um uh just yet because

939
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,679
let's look at what what actually

940
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,679
happened here which is okay so

941
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,000
we we

942
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,320
often make statements like the security

943
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,519
of x

944
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,559
is greater than the security of not x

945
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,640
when instead we should have been saying

946
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
something like the security

947
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,640
given a b c and d

948
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,039
then the security the outcomes for x are

949
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,960
better than the the outcomes for not x

950
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,360
in in those cases well

951
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,080
so

952
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,480
so are we good now well

953
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,840
well so a couple of things happened here

954
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,960
like what is the difference between

955
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,399
these two statements well the first is

956
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,039
you know you hugely expanded the scope

957
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,880
when you say the outcomes given a b c

958
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,360
and d well that means if it's not a or

959
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
not b or not c or not d

960
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
then you've made no statement at all so

961
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,120
when you tell me when you make this

962
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,840
statement you've hugely expanded the

963
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,279
scope beyond what you can actually

964
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,799
justify even assuming that you can

965
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,720
strongly justify this statement making

966
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
this statement is just an enormous

967
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,880
overclaim depending on how narrow

968
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
depending on how

969
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
um sorry narrow um

970
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,919
um a b c and d r so

971
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,480
we've just overclaimed secondly is

972
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,880
it's very easy when we start rephrasing

973
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,080
things from this format to um talking

974
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,840
about

975
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,399
security um for forgotten implicit and

976
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,159
vague assumptions to creep in it's a

977
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,720
great way of not saying precisely what

978
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
it is you mean

979
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
under cover of you know um i'm i'm

980
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,799
mapping things

981
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,240
on the cover of you know essentially

982
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,559
simplifying um simplifying what's going

983
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,279
on and then third i think that this is

984
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,240
kind of the the key point is that well

985
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,440
if you look at here if this is my

986
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,480
justification the outcome um

987
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,600
you know doing x is better when a b and

988
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,000
c and d apply than not

989
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,360
the entire justification for doing x

990
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,640
hinges on how plausible it is that a and

991
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,760
b and c and d actually happen and so

992
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,240
when you rephrase from this statement to

993
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,720
that statement you left out the only

994
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,960
thing that matters you left out the

995
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
piece of information that will allow me

996
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,279
to decide whether i should invest in x

997
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,799
or not the the size and the scope a set

998
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,360
of circumstances under which it will um

999
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,880
um

1000
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,240
um generate um generate a benefit so

1001
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,960
it's going to demonstrate um you know

1002
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
how easy and it might seem and i know

1003
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,919
much of this seems seems seems abstract

1004
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,520
but to make it you know to make it a

1005
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,839
little more concrete right to take um

1006
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,079
say forgotten and implicit assumptions

1007
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
we don't forget assumptions right we're

1008
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,960
very careful and we document them and

1009
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,639
write them down not all together so i

1010
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,280
think um so look at for example here's

1011
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
one password which is you know um a

1012
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,879
whole bunch of bits and it's random and

1013
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,239
it's doing you know all the kind of

1014
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,320
stuff that people recommend and here's a

1015
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,079
password that is well it's not too bad

1016
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,239
it'll stand up to but it's

1017
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,239
many people would feel very very very

1018
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,918
happy with the statement the security of

1019
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,079
this password one is greater than the

1020
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,359
security of password two that that

1021
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,119
password is a stronger password that

1022
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,520
there is some inherent quality that has

1023
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,560
been attained that is better about this

1024
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,359
well

1025
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,480
um

1026
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,359
so

1027
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,000
so i actually have been using at a large

1028
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,839
online retailer a password that is

1029
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,440
considerably weaker than the second one

1030
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
here for the last you know 15 or so

1031
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
years so

1032
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,359
the the how is that a counter example to

1033
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,839
the claim that the outcomes that the

1034
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,440
outcome for this one is better than that

1035
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,359
one well no you've just been lucky so

1036
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,240
far or put another way is like well okay

1037
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,760
the outcome is expected only to be

1038
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,440
different if the password file leaks

1039
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
right so there's an assumption here that

1040
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,200
kind of um that didn't get that didn't

1041
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,520
get mentioned well and if the password

1042
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,119
file leaks that's not quite a whole the

1043
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
whole story either well if the password

1044
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
file leaks but it's stored in plain text

1045
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,160
then also there would be no difference

1046
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
in the outcome between these two cases

1047
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,480
right

1048
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,040
or if it was reversibly encrypted right

1049
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,560
then you know if it's reversibly

1050
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
encrypted and the guy gets the file he

1051
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,119
either gets the key or he doesn't get

1052
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,440
the key and and he either gets plain

1053
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,839
text again or he gets gibberish or i

1054
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,640
guess if it leaked and my password was

1055
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,119
reset before um before anything that

1056
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
actually happened so my point here is

1057
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,079
that when we said the security that of

1058
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,359
this password was better than the

1059
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,599
security of that password we left out

1060
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,280
you know a b c d at least these and

1061
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,720
there's actually a much longer chain of

1062
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,079
assumptions that kind of stretches to

1063
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,400
the horizon and what's happening is that

1064
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
the claim is getting narrower and

1065
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,480
narrower and narrower and narrower and

1066
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
the set of the set of circumstances that

1067
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,440
have to apply in order for there to be

1068
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,480
an observable discernible difference

1069
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,640
between these two is getting narrower

1070
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,240
and narrower and narrower and when i

1071
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,920
express it this way when i say the

1072
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,599
strength of one is greater than the

1073
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
strength of the other or the the

1074
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,960
security of one is greater than the

1075
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,720
security of the other i obscure all of

1076
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,480
that i i i i'm speaking as though there

1077
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,800
is an abstract platonic good

1078
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,599
called security increases in which are

1079
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,400
inherently good no that is not the case

1080
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,520
if you know if not a or not b or not c

1081
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
or not d

1082
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,800
then there is no difference whatsoever

1083
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
between these to claim that the security

1084
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,839
of this

1085
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,160
is greater than the security of that if

1086
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,640
any of these conditions don't hold is to

1087
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,599
claim that there is some unobservable

1088
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,280
inherent good and you're essentially

1089
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
making what you know would be called a

1090
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,440
metaphysical claim you're making a claim

1091
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,320
which will manifest itself in the

1092
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,880
observable universe never and that's

1093
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,560
those are not the kind of claims that

1094
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
that

1095
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,640
so the exercise i just went through

1096
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,920
there of flushing out the assumptions so

1097
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
it's very difficult when you argue for a

1098
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,320
measure and you argue in favor to make

1099
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,839
sure how can i make sure that i've

1100
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,000
actually got all of my assumptions right

1101
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
i say we should do x and i can think of

1102
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,839
and somebody asks me to justify and say

1103
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,359
well you can imagine a situation where a

1104
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
bad guy does this and a bad guy is that

1105
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,800
and blah blah blah blah but

1106
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,040
what i'm very interested in this what

1107
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,200
what can we accept as as compelling

1108
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
evidence and be sure that we're not

1109
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,960
making errors and i think the way to the

1110
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
way to keep yourself honest here and

1111
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,839
there's no and there's no one easier to

1112
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,079
fool than yourself generally speaking is

1113
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,160
it needs to constantly ask what would it

1114
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,800
take to show me that i'm wrong so when i

1115
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
claim that this password is better than

1116
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,079
that password or you must run an

1117
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,000
antivirus or you must do regular updates

1118
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
what would it take to convince me that

1119
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,880
i'm wrong because once you can make that

1120
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,640
statement now you have a clear

1121
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
articulation of the promise of the

1122
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,400
countermeasure that you're advocating

1123
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,640
because you have a clear statement

1124
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
of the set of circumstances in which it

1125
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,960
will make an observable difference and

1126
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,640
the smaller that set is and that's what

1127
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
we saw happening on the on the on the

1128
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,160
last slide is that the set of cert the

1129
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,560
set of places where there was an

1130
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,800
observable manifest difference became

1131
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,440
smaller and smaller and smaller so

1132
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
the claim that i was making got weaker

1133
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,520
and weaker and weaker and the value of

1134
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,839
the countermeasure got weaker and weaker

1135
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:34,960
and weaker

1136
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,680
so

1137
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,560
um

1138
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,520
so

1139
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
so what would it take to show that i'm

1140
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
wrong so i have a countermeasure i think

1141
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
i think to be secure you should do the

1142
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,280
following i think in order to improve

1143
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,200
outcomes you should do x

1144
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,960
and ask yourself what would it take to

1145
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,320
show that i'm wrong and if your answer

1146
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
to that question is nothing nothing

1147
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
would convince me that i'm wrong because

1148
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
i have a proof

1149
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
you are actually the contra you are

1150
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,880
actually promising nothing if you're

1151
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,839
promising and if nothing would convince

1152
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,359
you that you're wrong

1153
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,200
then you are making no statement

1154
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,000
whatsoever about the observable about

1155
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,400
the observable universe if you don't

1156
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,560
know you're confused about what it would

1157
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,720
take to um

1158
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,400
to convince you that you're wrong you

1159
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,240
actually don't know what the counter

1160
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,439
measure you're advocating for

1161
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,359
promises let me give you an example

1162
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,760
nothing falsifies i have a proof i have

1163
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,440
a proof that you know passwords of a

1164
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
certain

1165
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,560
flavor need to um you know do better

1166
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,160
than anything else

1167
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,720
or or take this for example and the the

1168
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,040
the kind of my running example in in

1169
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,280
this deck is if you don't use a unique

1170
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
password per count then a bad guy who

1171
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,960
gets one of your accounts gets into one

1172
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
of your accounts can compromise several

1173
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,520
of your others that sounds like a a a

1174
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,000
good argument in favor of never reusing

1175
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,680
passwords and the rewarding of that is

1176
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,119
more or less the argument that you'll

1177
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,720
always see well

1178
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,680
you can rephrase you can rephrase that

1179
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,520
statement i apologize the fonts didn't

1180
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,400
come out super well here um if you don't

1181
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,599
do x

1182
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,240
then a bad guy can do something not made

1183
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,400
impossible by x

1184
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
and that is a true statement

1185
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,720
there is no possibility that someone is

1186
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
going to be able to um come up with

1187
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
something that refutes it but it's a

1188
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
tautology and tautologies do not make

1189
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
useful statements about the world you

1190
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,720
can't make it tautologies do not give

1191
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,760
you tools for anticipating future um

1192
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,480
future experience so for example i can i

1193
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,880
can use this tautology to justify very

1194
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,560
many things if you don't use a faraday

1195
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,480
cage then a bad guy who gets close

1196
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,040
enough can um can you know steal your

1197
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,640
your private keys um over

1198
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,040
electromagnetic these are two just two

1199
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,079
instances of this particular um of this

1200
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,240
particular unfalsifiable or or

1201
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,079
tautological statement

1202
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,720
um and if a if a is a convincing

1203
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,119
argument against password reuse then b

1204
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,440
is a convincing argument against against

1205
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
faraday cages i mean for faraday cages

1206
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
um but clearly clearly no one uses a

1207
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,079
faraday cage and

1208
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,240
password reuse is actually a pretty

1209
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,720
risky um so what's what's what's the

1210
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,200
difference here i'm not arguing that um

1211
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
um

1212
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,960
using a unique password per account or

1213
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,359
or avoiding reuse is as is as silly as

1214
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,960
using a faraday cage what i'm saying is

1215
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,920
this is

1216
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,680
this is a sensible countermeasure in

1217
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,839
many circumstances and this one is

1218
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,200
almost never

1219
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,280
but the real justification isn't written

1220
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,359
down here the real justification is if

1221
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,119
you don't use a unique password per

1222
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,560
account and then a bad guy gets one can

1223
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,880
get into the other cards and

1224
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,280
and this is a plausible attack this

1225
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,000
actually happens it is the plausibility

1226
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,920
of the set of circumstances under which

1227
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,359
there will be an observable difference

1228
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,200
that is the justification not the

1229
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,359
tautological statement saying if you

1230
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,520
don't do x um then a bad guy can do

1231
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,000
something not made impossible by x

1232
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,920
so a tautological statement you can't be

1233
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
immune to contradiction and make useful

1234
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,839
statements about experience once you

1235
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,200
um if there's nothing possible that will

1236
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,720
prove you wrong then you're really

1237
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,200
making no explicit promise about how

1238
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,400
outcomes will be improved with the

1239
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,079
measure that you're advocating

1240
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,680
the second one i want to

1241
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,480
talk about is like well i don't know i'm

1242
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,359
actually confused or unsure about what

1243
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,319
would

1244
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,400
get me to admit that this

1245
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
counter-measure um isn't worthwhile and

1246
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,960
i think that this is the case with

1247
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,240
actually a lot of counter-measures that

1248
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,839
we have so for example what would

1249
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,359
convince us that um that this um that

1250
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,200
this is a waste of time that these you

1251
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
know kind of upper lower and you know

1252
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
the the password composition policies

1253
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,200
that

1254
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,000
and

1255
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
i'm not honestly sure i mean i'm i'm not

1256
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,119
honestly sure that we could agree upon

1257
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,560
what what what piece of evidence what

1258
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,599
observation or what analysis would say

1259
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,440
this is comprehensively we can now throw

1260
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,839
this um

1261
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,119
in in

1262
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,040
in the dustbin i think that's exactly

1263
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,800
what happened with um

1264
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,040
uh the argument between

1265
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,880
um i was going to say the argument

1266
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,640
between um the guy

1267
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
nor nielsen and schneier but it was

1268
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,760
actually the argument between schneider

1269
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,040
engineer which schneider and schneider

1270
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,960
two weeks later um

1271
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,880
the um

1272
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,319
what would

1273
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,200
what

1274
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,599
would convince us that password masking

1275
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,359
is a waste of time

1276
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,839
well we don't know right i i mean

1277
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,960
would it be an a b randomized trial over

1278
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,720
what length of time over what subset of

1279
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
users over i think if you start to ask

1280
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,800
the question that way you you begin to

1281
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,319
think in the right direction but the

1282
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,560
real reason that um

1283
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,640
neither i nor schneiner or anybody else

1284
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
can get to to an answer is we don't

1285
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,240
actually know what this counter measure

1286
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,839
is doing we're confused about if we're

1287
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,760
confused about what would overthrow it

1288
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,119
we're confused about what it's actually

1289
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,560
doing there in the first place and the

1290
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,760
similar thing i think is you know

1291
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,839
antivirus well antivirus it certainly

1292
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,760
doesn't do nothing it's certainly a very

1293
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,520
useful thing but what precisely does it

1294
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,040
do what precisely would convince me that

1295
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,119
antivirus doesn't do as good a job as i

1296
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,240
think

1297
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,520
it is doing

1298
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,440
password and aging and expiration and

1299
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,920
this is one this is one where we kind of

1300
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,440
have make some progress in the last two

1301
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
or three years of people saying yeah you

1302
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,800
know the stuff of making people change

1303
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,560
their password every 90 days doesn't

1304
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,319
seem to be doing as much but i think

1305
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,480
more interesting than knocking that one

1306
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,440
silliness off the table is how did we

1307
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,040
get here in the first place and why does

1308
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,599
it take why does take so long and if you

1309
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,240
look at um

1310
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,000
if you try to find

1311
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,440
um

1312
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,119
what would it take to convince me that

1313
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,920
this is that this doesn't work what is

1314
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,400
the actual justification for it you will

1315
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,960
find you know blogs with waffle and

1316
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,520
weasel words and analogies and you know

1317
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,280
pointers to pointers to pointers to best

1318
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
practice documents but you won't find

1319
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,440
anything that we will actually find i

1320
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,960
would consider as a solid falsifiable

1321
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,920
contradictable um statement that

1322
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
promises um that

1323
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,000
that promises something

1324
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,280
um

1325
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,319
the

1326
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,200
falsifying i mean i mean falsifying i

1327
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,760
think was really um

1328
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,079
extremely useful in flushing out it's

1329
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,079
all too easy to argue for counter

1330
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,599
measures and i think if you i mean if

1331
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,119
you go back to each of these things and

1332
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,359
many many others is that if you think

1333
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,960
about it and think about it hard and try

1334
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
to do this exercise

1335
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,480
and ask yourself what would it take to

1336
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,760
convince me that i'm wrong about

1337
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,160
antivirus or about

1338
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,599
that's not to say that i want to make

1339
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,760
antivirus go away but just to clarify

1340
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,920
for yourself what precisely are the

1341
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,760
assumptions under which this is making a

1342
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,200
difference

1343
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,280
it has the beneficial

1344
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,160
the beneficial

1345
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,079
side effect of flushing out flushing out

1346
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,040
the um the assumptions that you've made

1347
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,480
some of which are implicit and very

1348
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,240
difficult to um

1349
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,560
for example with password expiration is

1350
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,160
it is it trying to cut down on the

1351
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,520
amount of time

1352
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
that um

1353
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,560
that a bad guy has to guess the password

1354
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,160
or is it cutting down on the amount of

1355
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,480
time that he has to use the password or

1356
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,000
i think we have a rather confused

1357
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,359
understanding of what it's actually

1358
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,800
trying to accomplish and it's difficult

1359
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,319
to make improvement

1360
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,440
you know we have a set of counter

1361
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,680
measures it's very difficult to improve

1362
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,599
the return on investment of your counter

1363
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,200
measures if you have a woolly and

1364
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,960
confused understanding of what these

1365
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,079
things are doing in the first place and

1366
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,599
i think that that seems to be the case

1367
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
in each of um

1368
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,280
essentially everywhere i look

1369
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,640
and the value of having an explicit set

1370
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,119
of um an explicit set of uh

1371
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,240
you know statements about what

1372
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
assumptions you've made is that as i

1373
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,119
said

1374
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,560
that's your basis for deciding between

1375
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,480
you know whether you should invest or

1376
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,720
not it is the plausibility of these

1377
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,040
particular assumptions coming to pass

1378
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,560
because

1379
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,880
if we talk about security as an abstract

1380
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,720
good which is to be increased then

1381
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,000
there's no way out of the following

1382
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,520
difficulty which is you know well what

1383
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,119
is the set of countermeasures that

1384
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,040
snowden needs to protect his stuff from

1385
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,319
all the people who want to spy on his

1386
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,240
stuff well it's you know it's you know

1387
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,160
some long long long list of things that

1388
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,920
that snowden does including putting a

1389
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,119
blanket over his head and using a

1390
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,920
faraday cage and all of that so i i wish

1391
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,000
him while i you know um but that's not

1392
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,920
my problem my problem is what is the set

1393
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,359
of counter measures that cormac needs to

1394
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,720
do to protect his stuff i don't

1395
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,480
fortunately don't have the attack vector

1396
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,599
that he does

1397
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,079
so of all the things that he does what

1398
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,240
subset can i neglect now everyone will

1399
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,680
say of course it would be ridiculous for

1400
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,760
you to try to do everything that that a

1401
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,000
high assurance high value target does

1402
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,280
but telling me that i can't do

1403
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,359
everything is the empty statement unless

1404
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,800
you're going to give me some tools to

1405
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,559
tell me which ones to drop and the only

1406
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,400
way the only

1407
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,800
tools that you have i mean are um

1408
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,240
is comparing the plausibility of the

1409
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,400
scenarios under which each of these

1410
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,760
counter measures actually makes a

1411
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,000
difference the faraday kg i understand

1412
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,520
the vector i understand that it works

1413
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,359
but no i'm not particularly worried

1414
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,200
about somebody being being that close

1415
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,960
from being willing to invest that much

1416
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,960
to um

1417
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,400
to get to me

1418
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,440
so

1419
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,040
uh the fonts didn't come out super well

1420
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,280
on this one but um so

1421
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,240
kind of wrapping up here um look the

1422
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,800
temptation of unfalsifiable claims is

1423
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,880
enormous i mean it is enormous i mean

1424
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,240
they're good fun and i hate to be a

1425
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,400
killjoy i really do i mean

1426
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,760
um but

1427
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,280
when you make unfalsifiable games you

1428
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,920
may get to make big bold emphatic

1429
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,200
statements

1430
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,640
safe from the fear of ever being

1431
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,160
contradicted and i mean what could be

1432
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,599
better right it's like ice cream without

1433
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,119
the calories it's just you know you get

1434
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,720
to say the only secure system is

1435
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,880
unplugged encased in concrete and buried

1436
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,480
on underground what percent of the

1437
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,359
fortune 100 have been hacked 100 percent

1438
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,880
there are only two kinds of people those

1439
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,319
have been hacked and those who don't

1440
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,000
know it yet and when you make an

1441
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,680
unfalsifiable statement like this it

1442
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
sounds like you're being very rigorous

1443
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,160
it sounds like you have a very you you

1444
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
are very precise that you have spotted

1445
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,920
difficulties that other people have not

1446
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,599
noticed and no that's not what's going

1447
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,599
on at all exactly the opposite of that

1448
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,680
is going on all that's going on is that

1449
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,160
you were exploiting the trick known to

1450
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,319
astrologers and carnival barker since

1451
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,280
the beginning of time which is you never

1452
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,240
take accountability for what you claim

1453
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,280
you phrase things in wording so that you

1454
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,839
will never be testable as a matter of

1455
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:14,720
fact

1456
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,000
and

1457
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,440
only only when called on it do you one

1458
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,640
by one produce the caveats that will map

1459
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
this unfalsifiable claim to something

1460
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,040
that's more falsifiable and maps it into

1461
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,720
and i think that this is this is not an

1462
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,760
abstract difficulty this is um

1463
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,920
uh if you start looking for it i think

1464
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,119
you will

1465
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,119
after a while you know find it hard to

1466
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,440
not notice uh it the other reason

1467
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
unfalsifiable claims are i mean this

1468
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,599
seemed like a shortcut i know look

1469
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,520
users don't care about security and they

1470
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,119
don't do stuff and it just seems like ah

1471
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,440
there's a shortcut that we can get to to

1472
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,760
get them to do the things that we know

1473
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,160
that we know that they should do but

1474
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,119
well

1475
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,800
and unfalsifiable claims are a great

1476
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,960
shortcut but how come we get to take the

1477
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,359
shortcut no one else does right i mean

1478
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,440
why are our unfalsifiable claims why

1479
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,480
should anyone listen to our

1480
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,640
unfalsifiable claims and not to everyone

1481
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,240
else's because there's a lot of people

1482
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,319
out there who you know um

1483
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,160
the um fbi director comey says crypto

1484
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,079
backdoors are vital tool in fighting

1485
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,079
cyber crime consensus of senior defense

1486
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,520
officials in the u.s government is that

1487
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,280
nsa surveillance may be the only thing

1488
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
that can stop the next terrorist attack

1489
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,160
you know

1490
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,119
it's it's a very um

1491
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,160
uh

1492
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,599
it's difficult to articulate a coherent

1493
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,040
a coherent um position that says we

1494
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
should be allowed to make unfalsifiable

1495
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,000
claims but no other people shouldn't and

1496
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,960
you know

1497
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,400
to keep things kind of logically

1498
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
consistent it's best to say no we're

1499
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,240
going to try to justify measures in

1500
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,160
things that um

1501
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,280
using

1502
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,480
using the tools and mechanisms that the

1503
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
rest of the the you know scientific

1504
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,160
community would recognize as reasonable

1505
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,920
justifications

1506
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,680
um so conclusions um

1507
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
there's a problem with the way we reason

1508
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,359
about problems i mean

1509
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,359
we're using um

1510
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,359
not intentionally but

1511
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,800
maybe not intentionally i hope not

1512
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,520
intentionally but unfalsifiable vague

1513
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,960
and implicit claims and the effect is

1514
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,559
extremely modeled statements justifying

1515
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,000
a lot of the stuff that we we do and ask

1516
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,200
people to do

1517
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,319
protecting things and that is not to say

1518
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,520
that those things are completely

1519
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,119
pseudoscientific and there's no basis

1520
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,280
for them but in using these model

1521
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,680
justification statements one we're not

1522
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,480
being intellectually honest about it

1523
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,880
but two we are hugely overstating the

1524
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,800
strength of the evidence that we have

1525
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,720
and um

1526
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,800
um

1527
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,160
overstating the strength of the evidence

1528
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,720
that we have and and overstating the

1529
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,040
scope the things that we claim

1530
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,440
that that that it is inherently more

1531
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
secure to choose a password of a certain

1532
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,680
type as opposed to having a certain

1533
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,200
benefit in a certain limited set of

1534
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,640
circumstances these are fairly large um

1535
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,319
large over claims

1536
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,079
and

1537
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,640
much of this much of this is is is

1538
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,000
really about

1539
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,520
um

1540
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,480
you know there's good news and there's

1541
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,839
bad news here

1542
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,640
there is a problem to be fixed and the

1543
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,480
good news is

1544
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,800
that we have exactly the right tool set

1545
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,720
to fix the problem and security people

1546
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,480
make it a point of pride to be

1547
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,079
constantly questioning assumptions and

1548
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,079
constantly looking for the chance that

1549
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,599
the possibility that they've missed

1550
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,559
anything

1551
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,480
what i what i want to convince you of is

1552
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,240
that you need to worry about

1553
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,400
overestimating attackers in some sense

1554
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,880
as much as maybe not as much but as well

1555
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,960
as underestimating attackers we're very

1556
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,040
familiar to the idea if i underestimate

1557
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,000
an attacker then um then bad outcomes

1558
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,839
will occur so we are constantly scanning

1559
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,079
the horizon in front of us for the sign

1560
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,760
that attackers may have capabilities

1561
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,359
that we haven't that we haven't

1562
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,119
understood or that they've figured out

1563
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,440
some way of of working around our model

1564
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,760
we spend essentially no time considering

1565
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,359
the possibility that we have

1566
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,480
overestimated them that we have built in

1567
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,920
to our defenses things that are not that

1568
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,200
are wasteful and that are not

1569
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,880
accomplishing what we think they're

1570
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,240
accomplishing and that are safely um

1571
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,400
safely um

1572
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,599
protected from scrutiny by the

1573
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,760
unfalsifiable vague or implicit you know

1574
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,440
justification statements that we've put

1575
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,119
around them and

1576
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,000
um and you might well you know ask this

1577
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,520
guy's really telling me that you know i

1578
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,359
need to worry about underestimating

1579
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,200
attackers rather than uh sorry

1580
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,559
overestimating attackers rather than

1581
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,640
underestimating them and

1582
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,839
yes

1583
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,839
because an abundance an abundance of

1584
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,319
caution does not lead to an abundantly

1585
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,079
cautious solution it might seem that

1586
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,200
like oh

1587
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,559
you know this is security we can't take

1588
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,680
chances so we just we just um lard

1589
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,440
things up a little you just err on the

1590
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,280
side of caution

1591
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,960
but when you cascade

1592
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,920
many many many such

1593
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,920
cases where you're confusing sufficient

1594
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,079
with necessary

1595
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,160
sooner or later you end up in such a

1596
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,559
wasteful and overspend or overkill

1597
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,480
situation that

1598
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,040
what happens is not that you have a

1599
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,280
something that is is abundantly cautious

1600
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,640
what happens is you have something that

1601
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,319
is over complete and for which there is

1602
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,559
no good solution and what happens then

1603
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,720
is that i think what happens with most

1604
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,200
internet users is you look at this

1605
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,800
impossible array of things that you're

1606
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,720
supposed to do and

1607
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,559
you can't do all of them

1608
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,800
no one will articulate good rules to

1609
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,440
select which to do in which to

1610
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,520
to leave out no one will articulate a

1611
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,000
set of rules to how to prioritize them

1612
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,240
so one ends up choosing more or less at

1613
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,480
random from this large selection so the

1614
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,720
outcome of being abundantly cautious is

1615
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,400
that you end up with worse defense it's

1616
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,079
not a free lunch it's not oh we can just

1617
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,280
load things up and we'll get better

1618
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,200
defense that is not that is not the

1619
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,720
actual um actual outcome and you know um

1620
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,280
just the last line is you know on on

1621
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,440
everything on everything you know we

1622
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,720
have in security i mean i think it's it

1623
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,880
there's it's a very powerful question to

1624
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,799
keep asking yourself especially about

1625
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,640
the stuff that you're really really

1626
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,040
really really sure of you're so sure of

1627
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,160
this assumption that you don't even

1628
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,839
think of it as an assumption anymore

1629
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,359
keep asking yourself what would it take

1630
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,440
to convince me that i'm wrong and if the

1631
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
answer is nothing you've got a serious

1632
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
problem if the answer is i don't know

1633
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,319
well

1634
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,400
you know don't come up with excuses

1635
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,200
don't don't waste your your ingenuity

1636
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,280
and creativity coming up with excuses as

1637
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,640
to why we shouldn't hold ourselves to

1638
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,240
the same standards that you know other

1639
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,400
communities do keep asking yourself what

1640
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,599
would it take to convince me that i'm

1641
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,480
wrong okay that's i'll end on that thank

1642
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,690
you so much

1643
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:51,409

hi justin kapos nyu really really

1646
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,640
interesting talk um i'm curious

1647
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,160
whether you think that these claims and

1648
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,119
things also apply to situations like

1649
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,160
let's say

1650
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,960
you think about a one-time pad and the

1651
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,520
cryptographic arguments that go behind

1652
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,400
you know when you have a very

1653
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,960
well-defined model in terms of each

1654
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,359
party has has this pad that's unknown to

1655
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,680
the attacker the attacker can only

1656
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,680
see you know some some bits that are

1657
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,200
sent over the wire so they can only

1658
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
learn for instance the length of it this

1659
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,280
is something that you also feel

1660
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,079
falls under this category where

1661
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,520
you know

1662
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,480
that that

1663
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,880
that the at least accepted mathematical

1664
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,599
proof for this is not valid because

1665
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,920
um

1666
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,640
valid and invalid is itself a slightly

1667
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,559
vague term i'm less worried about things

1668
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,480
like that um

1669
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,359
where

1670
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,480
i mean

1671
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,520
the the consequence of um making an

1672
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,160
unfaul say making an unfalsifiable claim

1673
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,920
that something is necessary when it's

1674
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,720
not

1675
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,119
is that you you spent wastefully um

1676
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,440
um so suppose there's something you you

1677
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,480
think something is necessary it's the

1678
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,000
only way of doing something and it turns

1679
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,200
out you're wrong there's an easier and

1680
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,400
simpler way

1681
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,319
well you might or might not be concerned

1682
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,200
about that depending on how how much

1683
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,400
overkill was involved and how much

1684
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,040
but i wasn't really in this case trying

1685
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,359
to talk about overkill i'm i'm trying to

1686
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,400
stay

1687
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,520
you know on the the topic of

1688
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,280
do you feel that this that approved for

1689
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,040
something like this shows that this

1690
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,599
defense is adequate in this case i'm not

1691
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,440
saying that it is the minimum so

1692
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,280
when we do mathematical modeling i mean

1693
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,359
there is kind of a real empirical world

1694
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,760
and kind of you know it is exceedingly

1695
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,920
convenient and good and necessary to

1696
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,000
often abstract things and say okay

1697
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,400
assuming that the endpoints are not

1698
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,079
compromised and for example in

1699
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,520
diffie-hellman

1700
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,440
i assume that he sees g to the a and g

1701
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,920
to the b and can't do these are

1702
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,160
extremely valuable models now

1703
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,720
if but it's it's extremely important

1704
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,280
that you understand explicitly the

1705
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,480
assumptions in the model i think you

1706
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
know in crypto maybe there's a slightly

1707
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,559
better job done of articulating

1708
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,240
explicitly what the assumptions are

1709
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,079
right in diffie-hellman it's clear if he

1710
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,799
sees the end point well then you know

1711
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,160
no no no claim i think in in much of the

1712
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,799
stuff i'm talking about here i mean it

1713
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,799
seems to me more problematic when

1714
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,559
there's a real risk that the assumptions

1715
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,559
have not been adequately flushed out and

1716
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,680
i think that's the case with a lot of

1717
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,040
the password stuff is what are the

1718
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,960
assumptions i'm not entirely sure and i

1719
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,319
don't think anyone else is either and

1720
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,640
that makes it extremely difficult so if

1721
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,000
you don't know the assumptions you

1722
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,440
actually don't know the claim and the

1723
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,960
promise and if you don't know what the

1724
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,559
claim in the promise is it's hard to say

1725
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,079
whether it's doing a good job right

1726
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,720
thank you thanks

1727
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,040
thank you professor dawkins

1728
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,279
sure

1729
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,480
i think that what i see here is

1730
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,880
that when one makes a non-falsifiable

1731
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,280
statement one must put a smiley after it

1732
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,799
and my proof of this is that if one

1733
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,240
fails to do so then people like you and

1734
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,359
i are going to make fun of the

1735
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,319
unsubstantiated statement okay

1736
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,640
um

1737
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,359
sometimes people like you and i are not

1738
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,440
necessarily in the room right so so one

1739
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,599
of one of the difficulties is that you

1740
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,359
know if you look at a lot of the

1741
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,839
password stuff again is that you know i

1742
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,760
think by now much of the research

1743
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,040
community there's been a bunch of really

1744
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,400
good work in this area in the last

1745
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,160
couple of years and by now many of the

1746
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,079
things like you know the expiration and

1747
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,599
the the the um upper lower characters by

1748
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,200
now the research community is realizing

1749
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,480
oh wow these things are not doing the

1750
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,720
good that we thought but since it was

1751
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,359
expressed as you know password strength

1752
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,920
measured in a certain silly way is this

1753
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,760
abstract good that is everywhere always

1754
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,599
you know even if the research community

1755
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,680
has now realized this there are armies

1756
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,400
of bloggers out there who are you know

1757
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,079
putting out best practices and they will

1758
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,160
continue to do for for the next 10 years

1759
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,760
no matter how many smiley faces you and

1760
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,160
i put on anything yep unnecessary

1761
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,000
guidance has the craigshare gold problem

1762
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,160
right

1763
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,680
hi

1764
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,280
i'm going to make an unfastifiable

1765
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,280
statement or at least something that i

1766
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,839
think is and please comment

1767
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,119
if

1768
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,040
if all security researchers when they

1769
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,920
were writing blogs and papers

1770
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,440
adequately

1771
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,079
specified the attack model

1772
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,559
on which they're making claims off then

1773
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,760
you would have had to give this talk

1774
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,280
that might well be true i'm not sure

1775
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,839
whether i uh that that might well well

1776
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,760
it's not just a question of of you know

1777
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,920
adequately it's possible sometimes

1778
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,680
things are written

1779
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,440
um

1780
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,839
are written down clearly like if you um

1781
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:46,720
um

1782
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,240
if you talk to some of the people

1783
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,920
actually you know paul van orshot and i

1784
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,839
and and and danae have done some stuff

1785
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,280
on you know

1786
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,440
password guidance and and paul i think

1787
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,040
contacted um one of the people who was

1788
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,559
involved in the original nist documents

1789
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,480
right and they had an extremely clear

1790
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,240
understanding of the set of assumptions

1791
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
that applied for some of these

1792
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,640
composition rules too but

1793
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,079
um and they

1794
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,240
fully understood that they do not apply

1795
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,119
in the current circumstances but they

1796
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,920
you know they were not responsible for

1797
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,000
the world ignoring the say hey you know

1798
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,799
if a b c and d then the following will

1799
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,440
be true but if not a or not b are not c

1800
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,599
then no statement right

1801
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,440
just because the original

1802
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,040
you know people wrote the assumptions

1803
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,760
down clearly doesn't mean that

1804
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,440
things don't get lost along the way and

1805
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,720
in some things i think it's been so long

1806
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,960
lost that we can't even remember what

1807
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,839
the original justifying statement was

1808
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,640
so what you're saying is that

1809
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,160
even if we

1810
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,400
aim as a community to include these

1811
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,480
assumptions clearly in our papers and so

1812
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,359
forth

1813
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,079
it might not solve the problem if the

1814
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,039
rest of the

1815
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,319
rest of the world ignores that i think

1816
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,920
one thing that would solve the problem

1817
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,680
is being um

1818
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,119
um

1819
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,359
it is being um

1820
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,960
as maybe as crispin says putting a

1821
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,480
smiley face on and saying you know when

1822
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,720
somebody when somebody says you know

1823
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,720
i i think i know what you mean you said

1824
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,160
the security of x is better than the

1825
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,680
security of not x

1826
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,280
but challenge somebody on it because

1827
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,520
when somebody says okay i i said this

1828
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,400
but

1829
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,240
and that's clearly not an unfollow an

1830
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,240
unfalsifiable claim but everybody knows

1831
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,000
everybody knows this set of assumptions

1832
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
like well

1833
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,799
when

1834
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,240
the set of things that everybody knows

1835
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,079
isn't written down carefully somewhere

1836
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,599
there's no way of checking that what you

1837
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,039
think everybody knows and what i think

1838
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,400
everybody knows is in fact the same

1839
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,359
thing and this is the way ambiguity is a

1840
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,440
great way to generate confusion so for

1841
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,400
example i mean if you um

1842
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,359
much of the debate on on

1843
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,680
on something and i keep mentioning

1844
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,680
passwords because it's an example that

1845
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,680
you know is is very visceral and affects

1846
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,839
a lot of people but you will find people

1847
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,920
arguing about whether this password

1848
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,000
composition policy is more secure than

1849
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,559
that password composition policy

1850
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,160
when you rephrase it in this way it's

1851
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,000
clear this makes one set of assumptions

1852
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,200
that makes another set of assumptions

1853
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,880
you are comparing sets of assumptions

1854
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,520
and you will argue in circles here

1855
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,039
forever there's nowhere else for this

1856
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,880
argument to go there is no there's no

1857
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,720
halting criterion on this argument like

1858
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,599
the

1859
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,440
you know schneier and nielsen talking

1860
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,359
about is this secure or not for password

1861
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,520
masking there's no halting criterion for

1862
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,160
this this this conversation so

1863
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,319
yes no maybe is the right answer right

1864
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,839
um

1865
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,839
thanks

1866
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,200
i'd like to assert a unfalsifiable

1867
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,799
statement

1868
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,280
if your adversary can see what you type

1869
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,559
there's no such thing as a strong

1870
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,640
password if your adversary is what if

1871
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,799
your adversary can see what you type yes

1872
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,240
there is no such thing as a strong

1873
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,440
password

1874
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,680
um

1875
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,839
yes i mean if you yes if you're i mean

1876
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,440
when somebody goes around your model

1877
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,839
then you know you're uh there is no

1878
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,079
difference in outcomes between what you

1879
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,440
think is a strong password and a weak

1880
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,839
password correct key captures trump

1881
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,200
passwords

1882
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,280
is it falsified well i think the part

1883
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,960
about i think the part about strong is

1884
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,720
unfalsifiable because it's not it's not

1885
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,400
clearly defined yet you know it and it

1886
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,640
creates when you say strong it creates

1887
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,559
the impression that outcomes are somehow

1888
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,839
going to be different and what you're

1889
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,319
saying is no outcomes are so for example

1890
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,480
a better example is if it's stored plain

1891
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,480
text at the server there's no

1892
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,960
certain set of circumstances under which

1893
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,400
the outcomes

1894
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,680
will be different

1895
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,680
so the claim that one is stronger than

1896
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,480
another is in some metaphysical plane

1897
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,240
where we can speculate but there will

1898
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,039
never

1899
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,039
this the difference between these two in

1900
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,359
outcomes will not be manifest in this

1901
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:45,038
observable universe right ever

1902
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,400
i would prefer to say no i would prefer

1903
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,200
to say i would prefer to say there is

1904
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:57,920
there

1905
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,520
you know there will be an observable

1906
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,559
difference

1907
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,520
between x and not x under the following

1908
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,760
circumstances and then you can say okay

1909
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,760
we could if we bring those set of

1910
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,920
circumstances

1911
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,079
into being you know with a randomized a

1912
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,400
b trial and it might be a very big trial

1913
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,440
or

1914
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,640
you know and sometimes you know you

1915
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,280
might not have to um

1916
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,480
you can at least bring about a set of

1917
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,480
circumstances where vulnerable is

1918
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,960
another word that

1919
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,640
it's very easy to construct

1920
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,039
an english sentence that makes you feel

1921
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,559
like you know

1922
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,799
the absence of vulnerability is good or

1923
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,119
the increase in security or strength is

1924
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,200
something that sounds good even when it

1925
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,760
is doing nothing for you in any possible

1926
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,440
set of circumstances not in a narrow set

1927
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,799
of circumstances even when there's no

1928
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,400
possible set of circumstances and that's

1929
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,839
a danger that i think we've just fallen

1930
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,920
into over and over and over and over and

1931
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,440
often what you end up with are the

1932
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,520
enemies of reliability complexity and

1933
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,280
coupling and you you

1934
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,440
you you're striving toward a model of

1935
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,119
infinite complexity

1936
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,240
and

1937
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,160
none of these

1938
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,359
replacing replacing the statement

1939
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,200
outcomes are improved in the following

1940
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,160
circumstances with securities improved

1941
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,640
this is this is a great tool

1942
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,240
for increasing confusion and smuggling

1943
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,319
you know

1944
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:19,760
unidentified assumptions across the

1945
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,359
border right i mean it is it is uh

1946
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,559
and i'm

1947
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,200
i'm i'm in favor of building a wall at

1948
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,599
the border and all but all assumptions

1949
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,359
must show their papers as they cross i'm

1950
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,039
a bit of a

1951
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,720
to use a an unfortunate um analogy

1952
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,000
um

1953
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,359
okay thank you but we certainly in

1954
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:40,960
practice we do make assumptions about

1955
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,200
the capabilities and the motivation of

1956
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,000
our adversary right i i work in a skiff

1957
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,319
it's very much a faraday cage do i have

1958
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,119
a faraday cage at home no

1959
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,119
completely different set of adversaries

1960
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,760
that we're talking about in both cases

1961
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,400
thanks thank you

1962
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,240
hi great talk um so i'm gonna make a

1963
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,839
safety analogy

1964
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,000
if uh i'm on a boat and i have a life

1965
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,559
jacket i expect that life jacket to

1966
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,960
protect me from drowning

1967
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,039
i don't expect it to protect me from a

1968
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,680
heart attack once i hit the water okay

1969
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,480
so

1970
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,839
i'm kind of in

1971
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,480
agreement with we need to explicitly

1972
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,079
state our assumptions on what adversary

1973
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,000
we're defending against

1974
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,400
and even potentially

1975
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,960
admitting to the fact that whatever

1976
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,760
security that we put in place is not

1977
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,880
perfect

1978
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,440
i may still drown if i have a life

1979
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,200
jacket if you will

1980
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,039
so i think the

1981
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,240
better thing to think about here is risk

1982
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,640
for if my defense

1983
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,640
is imperfect

1984
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,920
what are the

1985
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,039
what are the impacts of that of the

1986
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,200
adversary winning

1987
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,280
i mean so to decide on the efficacy of

1988
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,960
some countermeasure i mean i think like

1989
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,520
the claim that the outcome

1990
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,079
for doing x in circumstances abcd are

1991
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,480
better than doing not x depends it seems

1992
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,200
to me on you know the cost of a bad

1993
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,280
outcome the cost of the counter measure

1994
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,319
and the size and plausibility of the set

1995
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,560
of circumstances under which the the the

1996
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,719
outcomes differ um

1997
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,319
it's

1998
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,600
the allure of mapping that complex

1999
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,880
multi-dimensional problem some of which

2000
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,399
must be done subjectively like

2001
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,960
subjectively deciding well

2002
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,279
how do you know that somebody isn't you

2003
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,158
know isn't right now trying to you know

2004
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,640
listening on your system um

2005
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,399
the temptation to

2006
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,719
replace that complex multi-dimensional

2007
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,839
question with a one-dimensional security

2008
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,920
is improved if you do x is very very

2009
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,158
tempting but we've simplified you know

2010
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,158
way beyond what is what what is

2011
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,679
justifiable

2012
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,120
um

2013
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,880
to to um

2014
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,839
um

2015
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,799
you know explicitly explicitly um you

2016
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,040
know stating our assumptions i think

2017
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,399
you know i i wouldn't like to be

2018
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,439
misunderstood i mean i don't think

2019
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,920
anyone is advocating for not writing

2020
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,120
down assumptions and i think you know

2021
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,238
pretty much everyone will will you know

2022
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,158
pound the table and say absolutely you

2023
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,000
won't find anyone anywhere who says no

2024
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,120
it's okay to not write down your

2025
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,839
assumptions but somehow somehow we end

2026
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,520
up in this situation where if you look

2027
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,679
at you know what is the tip of the spear

2028
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,040
for most internet users all this

2029
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,120
password and antivirus stuff somehow we

2030
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,640
end up and we stare at it and i don't

2031
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,839
know what the assumptions are and

2032
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,279
neither do i

2033
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,600
does anyone in the room so somehow

2034
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,319
these things get get lost along the way

2035
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,759
so so if if i'm an internet user and i

2036
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,040
have an account for say weather.com sure

2037
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,040
where i have very little data about

2038
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,799
myself and then i have my bank account

2039
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:51,679
then

2040
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,000
the risk of my bank account being

2041
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,080
compromised it's a much

2042
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,679
i care about that more than if my

2043
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,480
weather.com account is compromised yeah

2044
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,840
and as an internet you're allowed to say

2045
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,360
i don't care i mean you're allowed to

2046
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
say you have my permission you have my

2047
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,760
permission but but i think talking about

2048
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,040
that with you know joe schmo user is is

2049
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,920
useful right talking about

2050
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,239
taking risk into consideration i think

2051
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,760
that that's one of the things that is it

2052
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,120
is it is difficult i mean

2053
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,040
the the complexity of that um

2054
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,640
so for example

2055
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,239
take that problem the running problem i

2056
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,920
had of you know i've got 100 different

2057
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,040
accounts and there's a bank account and

2058
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,560
there's my you know

2059
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,560
account as an employee of microsoft and

2060
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,400
various other things and clearly some of

2061
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,679
these are much more important than

2062
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,120
others and some of them i don't care

2063
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,880
about at all and

2064
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,320
it's

2065
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
the the rule that all of your passwords

2066
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,520
should be strong and you should never

2067
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,719
reuse is simple clear and easily

2068
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,719
articulated it's also absolutely

2069
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,159
impossible to act upon now the

2070
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:57,360
a a set of rules that would be

2071
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,159
easy to act upon unfortunately has the

2072
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,280
problem that it is difficult to to

2073
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,320
articulate in a in in a way that even

2074
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,440
approaches the simplicity um of of

2075
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,199
saying just keep them all keep them all

2076
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,600
separate so for example i don't

2077
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,880
um

2078
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,360
for some people weather.com might be the

2079
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,880
most important site to them for some

2080
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,320
people facebook is more important to

2081
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,480
them than their than their than than

2082
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,800
their bank right it is difficult it is

2083
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,840
difficult to articulate

2084
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,679
in a really simple way but i think

2085
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,480
we shouldn't let the them

2086
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,000
or

2087
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,199
letting

2088
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,719
the the the complexity of that

2089
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,040
of that conversation

2090
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,640
using that as an excuse to make

2091
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,360
unjustifiably

2092
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,760
kind of strong claims

2093
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,199
you know we shouldn't do that because

2094
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,120
it's leading us you know it leads to the

2095
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,640
effect where

2096
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,239
the instructions we give people are

2097
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,600
simple and clear but they're also

2098
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,760
impossible and

2099
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,280
people just ignore right so we have no

2100
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,400
effect

2101
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,519
thank you sure thank you

2102
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,360
hey carmack abe hey uh so first of all

2103
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,360
i'm actually wondering if the uh

2104
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,120
argument you're making this talk

2105
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,080
is falsifiable

2106
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,560
what what's no what's uh i'm warning you

2107
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,239
no so what's no so what's what's what

2108
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,920
statement is it i made that you think is

2109
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,760
not falsifiable you're you're you're

2110
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,080
just you're your overall proposition

2111
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,560
no so i think so people sometimes no no

2112
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,239
no people sometimes use this as a joke

2113
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,000
to come back to pop or they say oh you

2114
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,400
know falsifiability is not falsifiable

2115
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,440
well falsifiable is the claim is not

2116
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,520
that thou shalt or thou shalt not do

2117
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,840
unfalsifiable stuff i think i i tried to

2118
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,880
structure it carefully to say

2119
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,920
if you make unfalsifiable claims the

2120
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,280
problem is that if you're wrong about it

2121
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,719
nothing will ever show you that you're

2122
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,360
wrong now there are some things where i

2123
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,800
don't care if i'm wrong because it's a

2124
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,040
one-time cost right suppose you know

2125
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,480
suppose you

2126
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,920
you are misinformed and you think that

2127
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,280
diffie-hellman is the only way of

2128
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,440
exchanging a key you know over and you

2129
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,120
think it's a necessary condition and

2130
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,560
then somebody points out no there's

2131
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,480
something else well

2132
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,640
i i i really am i going to throw

2133
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,080
diffie-hellman away and use this other

2134
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,600
thing probably not because we've already

2135
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,199
invested the one-time cost of figuring

2136
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,400
it out and the the ongoing cost is not

2137
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,080
that great when you the reason i talk a

2138
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,080
lot about about the usability and

2139
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,239
password stuff is that here the costs

2140
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,719
are ongoing you get something wrong and

2141
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,199
you continue wrong and the pain and the

2142
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:32,560
cost just goes on forever but um

2143
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,400
so the claim is not the er

2144
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,640
you know no actually i absolutely agree

2145
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,159
i always ask i always like to lead in

2146
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,360
with the joke so um but uh but i think

2147
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,159
you're right

2148
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,679
you're not quite saying but sometimes

2149
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,520
what it is is you're wasting money or

2150
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
maybe a lot of money doing something you

2151
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,199
don't need to do or time which is what

2152
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,600
yeah well that's money right uh it's a

2153
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,239
cost right and i make this argument all

2154
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,080
the time that sometimes something isn't

2155
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,840
worth doing just because the cost is too

2156
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
much and we can't get there so i just

2157
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,239
want to add a couple of a

2158
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,560
couple of detail points oh

2159
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,600
i think half of what you're talking

2160
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,400
about

2161
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,840
and you're touching on this a number of

2162
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,679
ways is our use of language and the way

2163
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,600
we talk about these things and i

2164
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,040
remember you know steve greenwald did a

2165
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,719
paper a number of years ago on e prime

2166
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,960
for security where he talked about the

2167
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,080
use the

2168
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,400
our problem with the use of the the verb

2169
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,840
to be like saying something is secure

2170
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,000
doesn't really say anything meaningful

2171
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
correct right that if we say has the

2172
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,400
following security properties etc is a

2173
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,080
lot more constructive so some of this is

2174
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,679
just about how we're describing these

2175
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,080
things in some cases using the words

2176
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,880
that have ambiguous meanings or like you

2177
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,040
said implicit assumptions right like

2178
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,960
your argument the password thing about

2179
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,120
nobody can handle 100 different unique

2180
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,199
passwords the implicit assumption there

2181
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,159
is also nobody can handle 100 passwords

2182
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,400
if they have to memorize all of them

2183
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,679
right and our assumptions that meant

2184
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,480
that writing down passwords is verboten

2185
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,920
this also comes with the problem that

2186
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,600
assuming that all vulnerabilities all

2187
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,920
risks are equal and we have to address

2188
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,679
all of them right i've had contracts

2189
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:06,880
where i said i don't care about people

2190
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,199
writing down passwords if that means

2191
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,000
they'll accept stronger you know

2192
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,199
more complicated i don't want to say

2193
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,199
stronger you're right more complicated

2194
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,440
passwords right or longer and that's a

2195
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,440
good example of when people i mean talk

2196
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,400
about the

2197
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
you know

2198
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,040
if you say writing down your passwords

2199
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,640
is insecure

2200
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,280
and not having a really strong password

2201
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,920
is insecure well

2202
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,840
writing it down is a threat if somebody

2203
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,520
has physical access to the location when

2204
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,760
you wrote it down and this is a threat

2205
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,440
you know in a set of circumstances where

2206
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,440
somebody can do a guessing attack

2207
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,320
you know

2208
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,159
these are very diff

2209
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:45,520
and i think when you write down the

2210
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,520
assumptions you get well i'm more

2211
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,760
willing to live with this risk than i am

2212
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,440
with that this is this is a more

2213
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,679
plausible and more scalable vector to me

2214
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,640
than

2215
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,960
than and that's absolutely all of that

2216
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,120
gets obscured all of that gets obscured

2217
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,960
when you map it to this platonic good

2218
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,280
called security which which washes which

2219
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,760
washes all assumptions away yeah exactly

2220
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,880
and the other thing you made the comment

2221
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
about um how do we falsify things like

2222
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,600
say uh or can we about like say using

2223
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,480
antivirus actually i think we can that's

2224
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,840
something anybody wants to do like for

2225
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,360
instance you could construct an

2226
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,040
experiment where you deploy a thousand

2227
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,800
machines across the internet with

2228
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,199
antivirus and another thousand without

2229
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:26,159
it and you know within and operate them

2230
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,840
in certain ways and see which you know

2231
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,000
again infected randomly i wanted to do

2232
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,840
the same thing with firewalls years ago

2233
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
to show how effective or ineffective

2234
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,400
they weren't you can't get it funded

2235
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,440
well

2236
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,320
randomized b trials do answer do answer

2237
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,679
um they answer some things um

2238
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,600
the answer yes yeah the answer are many

2239
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,360
things and that might be the way to do

2240
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,600
it but it's uh yeah we have not it's a

2241
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,199
whole discipline and no i you know it's

2242
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,960
you can't get a you don't well it's

2243
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,400
hard to get it funded and i don't think

2244
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,000
anybody wants to do it because you also

2245
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,440
have that you also have the difficulty

2246
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,800
with the av in particular that if you

2247
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,600
try to do a randomized ab trial um over

2248
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,440
a large population one running antivirus

2249
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,760
and the other not an irb board will tell

2250
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,199
you that it's unethical to runs

2251
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,040
thanks

2252
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,400
but you're right otherwise okay

2253
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,560
i wonder if um maybe the situation we're

2254
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,199
in here uh has an analog

2255
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,679
with medical research and and health

2256
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,000
outcomes in the sense that i think you

2257
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,159
you end up with a lot of medical studies

2258
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:33,679
that are really well you know very

2259
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,239
targeted very the assumptions are quite

2260
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,040
explicit and there's a very careful

2261
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,360
attention to experimental methodology

2262
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,199
right and the researchers come out with

2263
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,560
a very narrow focused result of it

2264
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,440
and

2265
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,960
what's

2266
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,679
eventually absorbed

2267
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,560
in the in popular

2268
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,840
expectations of

2269
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,640
health uh can be entirely uh

2270
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,440
you know

2271
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,840
ignoring any of those assumptions and

2272
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,719
and i'll make an example of say medical

2273
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,600
research into the efficacy of exercise

2274
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,600
for health right so

2275
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,080
you know should we uh

2276
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,360
exercise uh at a moderate level for uh

2277
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,440
frequently and for long periods of time

2278
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,840
or should we do high intensity exercise

2279
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,000
for short periods of time should we wear

2280
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,960
shoes should we run barefoot should we

2281
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,520
stretch before we exercise or not i mean

2282
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,360
all of this stuff eventually gets

2283
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,640
absorbed

2284
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,880
you know in the popular media

2285
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,560
and doctors give advice to patients

2286
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,679
based on literally zillions of medical

2287
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,640
studies that had all kinds of

2288
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,719
variant assumptions

2289
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,440
with them and people honestly end up

2290
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,440
saying well i have no idea what the

2291
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,800
right thing is to do maybe i'm just not

2292
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
going to bother to exercise right sure

2293
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,040
so we end up with the same kind of thing

2294
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:57,920
where

2295
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,159
the the advice that's given

2296
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,880
uh you know really has little bearing on

2297
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,880
what the original research was

2298
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,320
and in a sense

2299
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,120
medical researchers don't feel obliged

2300
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,120
to take some kind of personal and

2301
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,640
professional responsibility for the

2302
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,800
crazy advice that people are taking out

2303
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,719
there they say hey a good did a good

2304
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,400
study and it showed something very

2305
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,120
specific and that informed the science

2306
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,199
but now we've got some really crazy

2307
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,960
stuff that's going on even doctors

2308
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,239
giving really strange advice to patients

2309
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:29,760
that really doesn't have bearing on the

2310
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,760
original assumptions of these studies

2311
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,520
they wouldn't give their patients that

2312
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,080
advice based on those studies right and

2313
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,280
in a sense

2314
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,159
we should be also careful about you know

2315
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:41,520
how much

2316
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,520
responsibility as a research community

2317
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,560
we take for some of the crazy you know

2318
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,440
somebody cooked up this this list of you

2319
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,719
know password obligations but

2320
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,520
you can't really say that there was you

2321
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,880
know some

2322
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,679
you know

2323
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:58,719
even

2324
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,120
uh you know in your venn diagram some

2325
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,760
some uh very clear

2326
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,920
studies that would have suggested that

2327
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,600
one should even patch this stuff

2328
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,920
together to result in that mess

2329
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,360
so

2330
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,280
i wonder you know

2331
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,199
we sure certainly should do what you've

2332
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:17,920
talked about is is look at making sure

2333
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,040
that our that our uh research uh you

2334
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,760
know

2335
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,719
is you know falsifiable and and and that

2336
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,960
we understand what that means but it

2337
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,880
doesn't necess we shouldn't necessarily

2338
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,000
expect that's going to result in

2339
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,400
sort of the external i.t community

2340
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,600
absorbing any of our

2341
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,560
results in a sensible way right sure

2342
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,679
i mean

2343
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,679
just to the last point first i mean i

2344
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,120
think um

2345
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,480
uh

2346
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,000
i i would kind of channel uh phil

2347
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,600
rogoway's talk this morning we said you

2348
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,960
know well

2349
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,880
how is this not our failing in the sense

2350
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,880
that if there's two billion people out

2351
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,040
there using the internet you know sure

2352
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,280
if there's a vacuum bloggers will fill

2353
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,239
it with stuff and just say stuff and i i

2354
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,719
think if we don't know we should say we

2355
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,040
don't know but you know

2356
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,800
it seems to me that there are many

2357
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,400
questions on how

2358
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,400
you know internet users can protect

2359
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,000
themselves that

2360
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
you know the the research computer

2361
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,679
security community

2362
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,840
um would be the natural people to own

2363
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,880
that that that's um well fair enough but

2364
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,280
at the same time i would i would argue

2365
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,800
that you know medical researchers

2366
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,120
certainly want to make people healthier

2367
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,280
right and they and they do that work

2368
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,760
with the goal of you know making people

2369
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,760
you know have you know fewer

2370
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,400
side effects from treatments or or live

2371
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,120
longer or you know be stronger or

2372
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,639
whatever it is right people are

2373
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:45,920
certainly aiming that and i would have

2374
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,400
to think that most of us are are

2375
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,080
you know are attempting and and you know

2376
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,760
phil's point i actually agree with that

2377
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,960
as well but many of us are really

2378
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,840
attempting to try to do real world

2379
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,400
um you know effects but but the result

2380
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,600
being

2381
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,679
any study has to be

2382
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,840
uh has to control a bunch of variables

2383
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,600
right which in the real world you know

2384
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,520
when you get to sort of the real world

2385
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,400
of of

2386
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,639
you know systems out there that live in

2387
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:15,280
in a changing environment and and bodies

2388
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,040
out there that live in a changing

2389
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,480
environment i think the hard part i

2390
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,679
think the hard part in medical research

2391
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,120
is i mean the gold standard in medical

2392
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,880
and biological stuff is randomized av

2393
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,639
trials and the hard part is always

2394
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,719
establishing causality right you know

2395
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,520
and correlation and and then there's the

2396
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,600
additional problem of of you know some

2397
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,639
studies don't replicate i think

2398
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,639
then there are definitely difficulties

2399
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,440
of um you know are you reprodu you know

2400
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,719
what uh

2401
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,560
some things are hard to do randomized av

2402
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
trials on um

2403
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,880
but for for ethical reasons and for

2404
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,040
for all sorts of other reasons um and

2405
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,960
longitudinal things are difficult also

2406
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,440
but um

2407
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,840
but i think

2408
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,840
it would be it would be quite an advance

2409
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,679
if we could get to where medicine

2410
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,840
currently is in terms of so for example

2411
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,120
there's been kind of what's described as

2412
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,639
this replication crisis in medicine

2413
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,000
where people figure out that oh if you

2414
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,800
use everything at a p-value of 0.05 one

2415
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,120
thing in 20 is a false result and and

2416
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,000
and this happens a lot but at least in

2417
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,159
in in medicine they don't have this

2418
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,000
question that schneider and nielsen were

2419
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,920
arguing at the top like we can't decide

2420
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,679
whether this is secure or not and we

2421
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,360
can't even decide what would answer the

2422
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,760
question if if somebody claims you know

2423
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,679
that i do a b trial and this is

2424
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,600
correlated with that well someone who

2425
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,520
replicates that study you know with a

2426
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,520
bigger you know a bigger sample size and

2427
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,920
says no effect that really calls the you

2428
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,679
know it it's fairly clear what the

2429
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,679
ground rules are and

2430
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,440
so i think

2431
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,600
medicine certainly has you know has some

2432
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,840
difficulties but i think where some of

2433
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,280
the claims we're making are

2434
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,360
are considerably worse than things that

2435
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,520
are based on ab studies where

2436
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,120
correlation was found but causation is

2437
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,560
not established

2438
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,320
well the last the last point i'll make

2439
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,400
on that is simply that you know one of

2440
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,320
the problems they have in medicine is

2441
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,480
really uh ending up with uh some kind of

2442
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,360
um

2443
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,920
correlation between the the research

2444
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,480
results that that have to be much

2445
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,639
narrower and more specific about you

2446
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,280
know changing of uh say chemical uh

2447
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,360
biochemical values in the body and

2448
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,040
things like that to whether that

2449
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,760
actually causes people to live longer or

2450
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,840
or have a higher quality of life right

2451
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,639
and to a certain extent that that that

2452
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,639
mapping is a problem that that we may

2453
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,080
have here as well

2454
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:32,800
but

2455
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,120
you know we may you know whatever even

2456
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,840
if we manage to end up with the more um

2457
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,480
very uh tightly expressed assumptions

2458
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,760
and and you know uh

2459
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,960
better defined uh elements of our of our

2460
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,920
research we may uh still end up with

2461
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,800
that you know what does that mean

2462
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,480
does that mean our system would be more

2463
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,199
secure whatever that means uh you know

2464
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,520
under the under various conditions in

2465
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,880
the real world i think we can make

2466
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,239
things better without making things

2467
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,520
perfect right if we would stop

2468
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,920
presenting tautologies as

2469
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,040
useful statements to guide behavior

2470
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,800
that would already be

2471
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,800
an improvement thank you thank you

2473
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,320
a couple of the previous comments about

2474
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,960
risk dovetail really nicely with your

2475
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,880
0.3 and conclusions there worry about

2476
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,639
overestimating attackers as well as

2477
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:27,679
under

2478
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,400
and the question then becomes

2479
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,000
secure against who for how long

2480
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,320
what are the attacker capabilities what

2481
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,880
are their desires

2482
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,320
are they going what is the likelihood

2483
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,000
that they will come after you as opposed

2484
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,760
to someone else

2485
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,239
and building that specifically into your

2486
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:50,000
risk model and documenting it so you can

2487
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,120
avoid

2488
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,120
shall we say under the water assumptions

2489
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,800
going on everyone knows well actually

2490
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,990
not everyone knows right

2491
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,080
[Music]

2492
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,440
that actually has allowed us to rederive

2493
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,920
why we want multiple character sets and

2494
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,639
passwords up to a certain length because

2495
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,840
our default attacker assumption for

2496
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,679
stolen password hashes

2497
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,520
is somebody who has access to reasonably

2498
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,280
sized rainbow tables

2499
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,880
and we document that and say this is why

2500
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,679
so

2501
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,639
our claim of saying we want to put

2502
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,239
multiple character sets

2503
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,320
in passwords below this length

2504
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,960
is not astrology we can actually say

2505
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,560
this is falsifiable if you get a better

2506
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,040
attacker well then we need to go longer

2507
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,080
right

2508
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,239
i just wanted to uh make that point

2509
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:37,280
about

2510
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,520
risk model and should incorporate your

2511
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,080
attacker capabilities otherwise you

2512
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,080
can't actually define what's secure yeah

2513
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,239
and i i think it i mean it goes to like

2514
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,000
a lot of the stuff including the stuff

2515
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,800
that we justify unfalsifiably it's it's

2516
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,800
not like there's no basis to it it's not

2517
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,560
like these things do nothing it's not

2518
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,679
like you know there was never any any

2519
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,639
reason

2520
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,239
for people to consider expiring

2521
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,400
passwords every 70 or 90 days it's just

2522
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,120
that

2523
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,520
when it's based on everybody knows and

2524
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,159
wasn't really written down and becomes

2525
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,400
lost in the midst of time and then it's

2526
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,560
difficult to argue if

2527
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,480
if i know that this is he if i know that

2528
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,159
this doesn't belong here it's easy to

2529
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,840
take it and throw it in the trash if i

2530
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,280
come along and i don't even know what

2531
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,199
it's doing here it's much more maybe i

2532
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:22,239
should just leave it there might be a

2533
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,679
good reason it's here and i don't want

2534
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,920
to take responsibility right it's it's

2535
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,520
as simple as that thank you so much

2536
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,840
thanks
