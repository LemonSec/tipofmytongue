1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
so as as adam said i'm adam lerner and

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,960
this is joint work with my collaborator

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,239
anna cornfield simpson who's also a

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,760
graduate student in our lab we're

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,600
co-first authors i just happen to be

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
giving the talk

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,480
and with my advisors yoshi kono and

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,279
franzi rosner

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,840
so to start this talk i want to convince

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,679
you of two things very briefly one is

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,039
that web tracking third-party web

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,520
tracking is an important thing to study

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,559
and the second is that we should be

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,600
studying it over time longitudinally

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,120
so first i need to tell you what i mean

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,399
by third-party web tracking in the

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
context of this talk

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,320
simply it's a it's a fairly simple

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
concept what i mean is the ability for

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
some entity on the web to build a

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
browsing profile about a user and that

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,280
profile simply consists of a list of

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
places on the web that a person has been

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
for example this list of sites here

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
so what's troubling about such a profile

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
well if we use machine learning we can

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
learn a lot of subtle things from even a

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,400
fairly innocuous list of sites

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,680
but people also use the web for

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
explicitly sensitive things they explore

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,799
religion and the health they look at

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
mental and physical health sexuality

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,119
politics and leaking this type of

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,240
information

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
can carry serious economic and social

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
and even physical risks depending on

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
your context

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,520
additionally there's been a lot of

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
psychological work on the effects of

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
being watched after the snowden

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
revelations it was shown that views and

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
edits of privacy-related wikipedia

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,799
articles declined because people felt

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,400
like they were being watched

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
and it turns out that if you put a pair

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
of eyes sort of like those ones on the

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
top of the page there next to a communal

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
coffee pot people will actually donate

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
more money towards the communal coffee

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
and these are really subtle pervasive

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
effects and so being watched by web

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,040
trackers could have similar effects i

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,399
wonder and so i think studying them and

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
understanding how we're being watched is

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
important to understanding this sort of

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,759
thing

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
second i'd like to make the claim that

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,399
we should be studying web tracking over

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,360
time i think we should probably be

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
studying a lot of things over time

61
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
we have been studying web tracking

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,360
they've been papers for about seven

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
years now

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
uh the oldest one i was from 2009 and

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,520
used data ranging back to 2005 but we

66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
don't really have a good sense

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,440
of what was going on with web tracking

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
before then

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
moreover i think we want to know about

70
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,959
trends here we want to know how these uh

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
how the development of these techniques

72
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
relate to

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
trends in web tracking

74
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
and

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
and these

76
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
these studies are all done in various

77
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,560
different methodologies and so they're

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
hard to compare over time and so i think

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,280
it would be cool if we had a way to look

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
at this at web tracking over time

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
and fortunately we do in this paper

82
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,200
we've come up with an idea and that idea

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400
is to use time travel

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
and and you're all looking at me kind of

85
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
funny kind of with expressions like this

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
right now uh but i'm serious we actually

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
have a limited form of internet-based

88
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,920
time travel so i'll take you on a time

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,080
travel journey right now back to 1996.

90
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
here's usenix.org in 1996.

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
and this is a snapshot of usenext.org

92
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,959
which was archived by the wayback

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,599
machine the wayback machine is operated

94
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,519
by archive.org it's called the internet

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,640
archive

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,599
and it's been our and they've been

97
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
archiving the web since 1996 and you can

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,360
see up at the top of the page of the

99
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
page here that there's this histogram of

100
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
snapshots of this page reaching back a

101
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,519
whole lot of snapshots the wayback

102
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,040
machine is actually quite extensive it

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
has

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
11 petabytes of websites archived an

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
individual website is quite small so

106
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
that's a lot of snapshots of a lot of

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,440
web pages

108
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
and impr importantly these website

109
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
snapshots contain javascript they

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
contain http headers they contain all

111
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
kinds of embedded resources and you can

112
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
load them up in a way they're served by

113
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
the way back machines web servers and

114
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
you can load them up in a website you

115
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,760
can your browser can execute them

116
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
you see you get all kinds of dynamic

117
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
client-side behavior like the javascript

118
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
executing and whatnot

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
and so we saw this and we thought hey

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
maybe we can perform measurements in the

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
past maybe we can say well we didn't

122
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
think to measure it back then but now we

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
can measure something like web tracking

124
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
and we think we can perform what i'm

125
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
going to call retrospective web

126
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
measurements

127
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,599
and in this talk i'll demonstrate that

128
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
we can by telling you about a 20-year

129
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,200
longitudinal study of web tracking that

130
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
we did using archival web data

131
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,478
i will give you the talk in one minute

132
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
as sort of an abstract if you want to

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
pay attention now and not for the rest

134
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
you might get more out of it than any

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
other way

136
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,240
so we started with this insight that web

137
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,919
archives exist that they might be able

138
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,360
to enable retrospective measurements of

139
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
the web and we decided to do an

140
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
archaeological study of web tracking to

141
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
demonstrate this

142
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
the world is not perfect neither are web

143
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,919
archives we found that they're sometimes

144
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,520
incomplete and sometimes inconsistent

145
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
and at least this leads to a lot of

146
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
challenges

147
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,080
we spent a lot of time on covering and

148
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
quantifying and mitigating these

149
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
challenges which led to the implement

150
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
implementation of our tool tracking

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
excavator which forms these

152
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,199
retrospective measurements

153
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
we validated those measurements by

154
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
looking and comparing them to trends in

155
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,320
the live web over the last five years

156
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
and then we were able to do a bunch of

157
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,759
measurements and draw a picture of web

158
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,039
tracking and how it's changed and how

159
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,880
it's evolved over the last 20 years

160
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
so in the rest of the talk i'll get into

161
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
the details of all of this

162
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
and to start i'll tell you how web

163
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,400
tracking works in the model that we're

164
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
thinking about

165
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
so first we need a definition a first

166
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,160
party is just a website that you go to

167
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
intentionally you type in a url type in

168
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
cnn.com and there you are

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
cnn is your first party if there are

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
cdns or advertisers or other third

171
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
parties that are embedded inside of cnn

172
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
then those then those domains are third

173
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,520
parties

174
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
and we're worried about those third

175
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
parties following you around the web and

176
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
learning about you if you recall from

177
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
what i said earlier our definition of

178
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,520
third-party web tracking is the ability

179
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
for one of these third parties to link

180
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
together different places you've been on

181
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
the web and form this browsing profile

182
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
of you

183
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
so technically how does this work say

184
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
that i'm sitting down and i want to read

185
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
some news so of course i go to the

186
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,560
onion.com

187
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
and my browser starts the process of

188
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
loading the onion loads the logo for the

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
onion and then it sees that the onion

190
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,840
contains an

191
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
advertisement and it makes a request to

192
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
tracker.com which is serving the

193
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
advertisement tracker.com sees this

194
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
request and it does a few things it says

195
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
i don't know you so i'm going to assign

196
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
you a new unique identifier call it 789

197
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,759
i'll write that down

198
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
in my browsing profile database over

199
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,039
here and i'll write down that i've seen

200
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,560
you at the onion

201
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
and then it picks an advertisement say

202
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,639
this this picture of shoes

203
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,240
and it sends it down to me and asks my

204
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
browser hey can you remember that you're

205
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
for tracking.com

206
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
tracker.com you're you are i id number

207
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
789 my browser does that

208
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,479
and i browse the onion for a while and i

209
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,840
start to wonder whether maybe this is

210
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
not in fact a real news site uh despite

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
what the tagline says so maybe i go

212
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
looking for some real news and i've

213
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,800
heard of cnn.com so i'll try them out

214
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and i go to cnn and i load some

215
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,120
resources from cnn then my browser also

216
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
sees that there's an advertisement on

217
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
cnn and it just happens to be also be

218
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
served by tracker.com

219
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,240
and so

220
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,599
my browser makes a request for this

221
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,120
advertisement and it sends along with

222
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
this cookie it says oh and by the way

223
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,919
you know me i'm i'm number 789

224
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
and the tracker says oh great okay so i

225
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
know you so i'll add cnn.com

226
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,599
to this browsing profile and i'll pick

227
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,960
an advertisement for you you seem to

228
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,160
like onions so i'll send you an

229
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
advertisement for onions

230
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,199
and so after this you can see that over

231
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,400
on the right here

232
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
tracker.com has started to build up a

233
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
browsing profile right now it consists

234
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
of two sites but as i continue to browse

235
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
the web and see tracker.com in more

236
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
places it will gain more information

237
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
about me

238
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
so the rest of this talk is structured

239
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
around the contributions of the paper

240
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,680
first i'll talk about the tool that we

241
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
built tracking excavator

242
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
and the challenges that it responds to

243
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
in doing retrospective measurements

244
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,199
so let me tell you about that tool that

245
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,160
we built i'm going to give you a high

246
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,919
level overview right now you don't need

247
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,280
to be able you don't need to read the

248
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
detailed text on here it'll come back

249
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
later when i talk about the challenges

250
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
and how we respond to them

251
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,039
for now i'll give you a high level

252
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,400
picture

253
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
first what we do uh is that we generate

254
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
inputs so for this study what we used

255
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
was the top 500 most popular sites for

256
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
each year so there was a different set

257
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
of 500 sites for each year

258
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,479
and the first stage of the tool takes in

259
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
that list of sites and it takes in a

260
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
time stamp in the past

261
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
and it combines them and it sends them

262
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
off to the wayback machine and says hey

263
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,800
which snapshots of these pages do you

264
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
have at this timestamp and it picks the

265
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
closest one that's that it likes the

266
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
best

267
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
it takes those snapshot urls and it

268
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,639
feeds them into the automatic browsing

269
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
part of the tool

270
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,000
the automatic browsing happens inside of

271
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,919
a chrome extension it automatically

272
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
browses those snapshots of the past web

273
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
it collects events so it collects all

274
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,679
the http requests made and all the

275
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,599
responses to them

276
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
and it collects other tracking related

277
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,279
events that happen such as api calls in

278
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,720
javascript that might set cookies for

279
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
example

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
and we store those events into a

281
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
database so that we can do that so we

282
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,680
can do analysis offline

283
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
and then in the analysis portion we pull

284
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,839
those events out of the database we

285
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
basically replay them that's what our

286
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
analysis tool does and we play them

287
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,120
looking for tracking behaviors

288
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
and so this whole structure of input

289
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
generation and munging browsing data

290
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
analysis it's all very similar to any

291
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
web browsing any

292
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
web crawling analysis any measurement

293
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
so what makes this hard given that this

294
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
is bending now this basic structure has

295
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,040
been followed before

296
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,640
there are a few different things and one

297
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,839
thing i want to point out here is that i

298
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
think that identifying and evaluating

299
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
these challenges is in and of itself a

300
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,040
contribution of this paper

301
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
because both our understanding of these

302
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
challenges and the tool that we built

303
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,399
will be really useful for doing future

304
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,760
measurements of this type of all kinds

305
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,439
of other properties of the web

306
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
okay so cookies don't work in the

307
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
archive

308
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
why

309
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,399
it's because the archive preserves

310
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
headers right so here's the if the

311
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
original site's had a set cookie like

312
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
this the archive will give us back this

313
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
archived version of the header and our

314
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
browser doesn't know what to do with it

315
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
we record it in the database

316
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
and so we have to handle it in our

317
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
analysis scripts so in the analysis

318
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
scripts over here

319
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
down here we see this where we see where

320
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
it says cookie simulation what we

321
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
basically do is there's a whole section

322
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,440
of our analysis code which simulates a

323
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
browser's behavior with cookies this is

324
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,200
a bit challenging we're doing it in

325
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,519
python and python's cookie libraries

326
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,120
don't precisely mimic the way that

327
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
browsers actually handle cookies so

328
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,079
there are some challenges here but we

329
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,439
and we end up getting quite close

330
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,079
the second way that the archive can be

331
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,040
challenging is that it's incomplete

332
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
in terms of cookies if you set multiple

333
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
cookies on a page this is a legal thing

334
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
to do the wayback machine will only

335
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
archive one of them it will archive the

336
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
last cookie that you set this is

337
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,120
unfortunate we miss out on some cookies

338
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
which are important to tracking

339
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,680
entire entire pages can be missing so

340
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,040
for example the wayback machine says

341
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,079
that this craigslist post it just

342
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,399
doesn't have it archived

343
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,920
this is pretty rare actually in the top

344
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
500 though since they're such popular

345
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
sites so this doesn't isn't a huge deal

346
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,640
in our study

347
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,839
another way that resources can be

348
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,120
missing is that you can have images

349
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,279
missing so for example every single

350
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
image on this page is missing even

351
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
though the html is archived in this

352
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
snapshot

353
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
fortunately these are less bad than you

354
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,279
would think because we still see the

355
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,040
requests for all of these missing

356
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
resources even though we never actually

357
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
get the image back we know what url it

358
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
was we know what domain it was on we

359
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,959
know it was a first party or third party

360
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,359
request

361
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
the other way that we can miss out on

362
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,279
things is that sites can opt out of

363
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,600
being crawled and being archived so if

364
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
you set a robots.txt file

365
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
the wayback machine will respect that

366
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
so what's a robots.txt file here's an

367
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,800
example of it this is

368
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,839
doubleclicksrobot.robots.txt file just a

369
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,160
policy file which makes a flight request

370
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
to automatic crawlers that they not

371
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
brown they not crawl certain parts of

372
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
your domain and the wayback machine

373
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
respects these uh requests so the

374
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
entirety of the advertisements from

375
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
doubleclick are not included in the

376
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,320
wayback machine

377
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
and interestingly something that it does

378
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
is the wayback machine respects these

379
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
preferences retroactively so

380
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
if i if the wayback machine has 15 years

381
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
of archives a particular page

382
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,040
and then the current owner sets a

383
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
robot's file that says please don't call

384
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
me anymore they will stop showing that

385
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
15 years of archives and so we can have

386
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
a lot of data sort of disappear because

387
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
someone decides now they don't want

388
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
their domain crawl anymore

389
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
and so these various things here that

390
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,160
lead to

391
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,079
missing data in the archive

392
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
are going to inevitably lead to some

393
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,880
error and they're going to influence the

394
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,720
way that we do our analysis

395
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
we sort of have two

396
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
broad choices we can do our normal

397
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
analysis we can look for cookies sent on

398
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
third-party requests this is going to

399
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
under count it'll give us a lower bound

400
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
on how much tracking we can see

401
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
we might also use a heuristic of over

402
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
counting we might say let's count all

403
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
third party requests regardless of

404
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
whether they have cookies this is

405
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
certainly an over count because some of

406
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
those requests didn't have cookies

407
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
and in the validation section of the

408
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
talk i'll talk about how this

409
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
undercounting and server counting end up

410
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,399
relating to the ground truth data that

411
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
we have

412
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,120
the last challenge i'll talk about is

413
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,519
inconsistency

414
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,760
this is best illustrated with an image

415
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,160
here's a snapshot of cnn from 2008 and

416
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
you will notice that it has content from

417
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,880
both 2008 and 2012 on the same page this

418
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
doesn't represent the web as it ever

419
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
looked at any point in the past

420
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
and the reason is because the wayback

421
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
machine basically made a mistake

422
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
it rewrites urls and it rewrote them

423
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,839
wrong or failed to rewrite some urls

424
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,200
some of the resources might point to

425
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
archives with the wrong timestamp or

426
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,560
they might even point to the live web

427
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
when these are when these requests point

428
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
to the live web in our tool we block

429
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
them in the midst of crawling to prevent

430
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,519
them from having any effect on our data

431
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
collection

432
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
if we get archived requests that have

433
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,279
timestamps that are far away

434
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
we handle that in analysis we look for

435
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,399
timestamps that are far away from the

436
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,000
time the timestamp that we're interested

437
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
in and we ignore those requests to make

438
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
sure that we don't get any of these

439
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,839
anachronist anachronistic erroneous data

440
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,800
tainting what we learn

441
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
so next i'll talk about the validation

442
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,839
because we've already removed all this

443
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,600
uh anachronistic data

444
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,839
but we still have a little conundrum

445
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,920
how are we gonna tell that uh what we

446
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
have left reflects real trends we know

447
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
the things we're measuring actually were

448
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,639
happening in the web at some point in

449
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,760
the past

450
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
but are they proportional are they

451
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
reflecting trends fortunately we have

452
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
some ground truth data some of our

453
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
authors published a 2012 paper in nsdi

454
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,880
in which they developed a taxonomy of

455
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,959
tracking and a method for

456
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,240
measuring those trackers and they

457
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
measured the prevalence of them and

458
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,199
we've repeated those measurements over

459
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,720
the last five years so we have a number

460
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,680
of ground truth data points 2011 13 15

461
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
and 16.

462
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
and we can analyze the difference

463
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
between our ground truth data and our

464
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
archival data and see if one seems to be

465
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
reflecting the other

466
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,600
so for the purposes of the talk and for

467
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
time i'm only going to give you one

468
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
result from the validation

469
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,959
uh there's more in the paper to which i

470
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,319
refer you if you're interested

471
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,639
so on this figure the y-axis is the

472
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,959
number of distinct trackers that we see

473
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,959
and on the x-axis we have time for these

474
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,040
four data points of ground truth the

475
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,399
black line is our ground truth it's the

476
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,760
number of trackers that we saw on the

477
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
live web in these four years

478
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
increasing for three years and

479
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
increasing for three data points and

480
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
then decreasing for one

481
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
above we have that over counting that i

482
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
discussed earlier just considering all

483
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
third-party requests to be tracking

484
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
requests whether or not they have

485
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
cookies in the archive and so that's an

486
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,399
overcount as we expect

487
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,240
below here we have if we're strict about

488
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
it in the archive if we say what are all

489
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,040
the places where we see third-party

490
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
requests

491
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
and cookies and of course this is an

492
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
undercount because we could be missing

493
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
cookies we could be missing requests

494
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,800
and we see that the relationship between

495
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,920
these is actually quite stable they

496
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
follow the same trend and the ratios

497
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
between them remain pretty close to the

498
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
same throughout so this is a pretty good

499
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,399
proxy

500
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
for what the ground truth data is in

501
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,680
this respect as i said there's more

502
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,560
analyses like this in the paper

503
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,680
but for now i want to get onto the

504
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,160
results

505
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,839
so i'll talk about a few pictures a few

506
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
lessons that we took away from doing

507
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,880
this 20-year longitudinal study

508
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
so to remind you our data our input data

509
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,079
set here is the top 500 most popular

510
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,800
sites from each year intemporaneously

511
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
we looked at these popular sites because

512
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,519
we think that it reflects sort of most

513
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,720
of the tracking that most users

514
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
experience and because we have ground

515
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,880
truth data for those top 500 so we're

516
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
able to calibrate

517
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
so you're probably going to have this

518
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
intuition that web tracking has

519
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
increased over time and i'm not going to

520
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
disabuse you of that notion we agree

521
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
with your intuition but we're scientists

522
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,079
i think it's worth backing up our

523
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,920
intuitions with data

524
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,279
and one thing that i

525
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
value about backing up intuitions with

526
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
data is that i think we can be more

527
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
precise about what we mean we probably

528
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
have this you know thought in our head

529
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,639
that web tracking has increased but what

530
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,639
do we mean one way of looking at it is

531
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,160
to say how many different players are

532
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
there in the tracking ecosystem and what

533
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,440
and what behaviors are they performing

534
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,079
how are they tracking people

535
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,240
and so this figure addresses that

536
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,519
on the y-axis we have the number of

537
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
trackers that we see in the data set on

538
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,079
the x-axis we have time

539
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
the gray bars are the total number of

540
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,959
trackers and the colored lines are

541
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
different types of trackers in our

542
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,680
taxonomy

543
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,439
and the so the colored lines add up to

544
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,240
the height of the gray bar

545
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
you can see recently some increase in

546
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,599
some increases in more complicated

547
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,119
tracking types near the end

548
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,640
and so this shows that there are more

549
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,679
trackers in the ecosystem but many

550
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
third parties knowing a little bit about

551
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
you is probably not as bad for your

552
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,799
privacy as a few party a few third

553
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,319
parties knowing a lot about you right

554
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
you can get a really rich picture of

555
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,280
someone it seems like you have a lot

556
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
more data to work with

557
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
and so we might also want to ask what is

558
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,720
the coverage of the most popular

559
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
trackers are that are on the most sites

560
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
and this figure addresses that on this

561
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
we have time on the x axis each

562
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
individual line is a single third party

563
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
that we saw in the archive and on the

564
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
y-axis we have the fraction of the top

565
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,679
500 sites on which that third party

566
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,080
appears

567
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,320
and so the lesson here is fairly natural

568
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
that we've grown dramatically even in

569
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
the last few years in terms of the total

570
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,400
number of sites and therefore the size

571
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
of the browsing profile that various of

572
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
the top trackers on the internet can see

573
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
you on

574
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
so the power of individual trackers has

575
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
grown over time individual companies

576
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,039
know about more about you they can

577
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,480
derive more about you

578
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,600
another lesson that i get from this

579
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,280
figure is if you look at this outlier up

580
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
here this is google analytics towering

581
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,559
above the rest

582
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,600
and what's interesting about google

583
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
analytics is that their main purpose is

584
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
not to track you across sites their main

585
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,960
purpose is to track you with insights to

586
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,160
provide analytics services

587
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,600
and

588
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,679
but the fact that they're on many sites

589
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,360
gives them a lot of power

590
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
right their decision whether or not to

591
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
track across sites to track you on the

592
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
various sites that they're on or just to

593
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
track you on the individual site is a

594
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
big inflection point for privacy

595
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
their choices gain a lot of power so the

596
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
individual choices of google analytics

597
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,600
matter a lot if we know what their

598
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
choices are that'll change the privacy

599
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
perspective and that if we want to know

600
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,440
about privacy

601
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,799
um

602
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,160
then transparency is really important

603
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
because we if we can't tell whether or

604
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
not they're tracking across site then we

605
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
we have a much less complete picture of

606
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,000
what our privacy looks like on the web

607
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,880
i have one last uh result for you

608
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
which is we've been talking we talked

609
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,919
amongst ourselves about the worst days

610
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,960
of the web

611
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,240
what are the worst days of the web look

612
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
like

613
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
they look like this

614
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
how do pop-ups relate to tracking

615
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
the answer is that pop-ups are actually

616
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
uh one of the types of trackers that we

617
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
discussed in our taxonomy because they

618
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
enable stronger tracking they enable

619
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
tracker to defeat certain defenses

620
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
by popping yourself up in a pop-up you

621
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,280
become a first party inside of that

622
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,919
pop-up and now you can set cookies

623
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,520
even when third-party cookie blocking is

624
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
enabled

625
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,600
so we looked at third-party pop-ups

626
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
in the archive we see the spike rising

627
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,320
rapidly towards 2004 and then after 2004

628
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
rapid fall off and they sort of

629
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,559
disappear what happened in 2004

630
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,720
well internet explorer started blocking

631
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
pop-ups by default

632
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
and other browsers around the same time

633
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,000
as well

634
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,240
what i find interesting about this is

635
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,080
that this wasn't a tracking related

636
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,919
decision right they the engineers at

637
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
microsoft probably were not thinking

638
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,360
about tracking they were thinking about

639
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
user experience they were thinking

640
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
people hate pop-ups we want to make this

641
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,520
better

642
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,480
right

643
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
and so the interesting thing here is

644
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
that the choices of entities like

645
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,760
browser manufacturers might have much

646
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
more influence on what kind of

647
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,679
techniques are effective and are used by

648
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,640
trackers than tracking defenses or

649
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,159
anything like that the ecosystem of

650
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,039
technologies in which an attack and

651
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,760
defense sort of exchange happens can

652
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
matter just as much as the things that

653
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
are explicitly thinking about that about

654
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,559
that

655
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,039
exchange

656
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,799
so i told you earlier on in the talk

657
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,320
that i wanted to study that we i thought

658
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,679
that we should study web tracking over

659
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,039
time so that we could see the

660
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,559
trajectories and how it fits into the

661
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,039
context of the web and we did just that

662
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,400
in this work

663
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
we studied web tracking over 20 years

664
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,480
from 1996 to 2016.

665
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,120
if in 5 or 10 or 20 years in the future

666
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,480
we realize that we should have looked at

667
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
something else

668
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
we can also do that with the methods

669
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
that we described that i described in

670
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,799
this talk

671
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,640
and so that's my hope for this work is

672
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,919
that we'll be able to go forward and it

673
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,000
will enable us and other researchers to

674
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
study a whole variety of web measurement

675
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
topics longitudinally and get better

676
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,799
insights about the way the web has

677
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,200
changed

678
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,880
thank you so much for listening and i

679
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,750
would be glad to take questions

680
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:38,089
[Applause]

681
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,760
questions

682
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
please microphone say your name and

683
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,000
affiliation sure paul van orshot carlton

684
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
university great talk really uh useful

685
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,799
tool i i agree that others will find it

686
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,039
useful um

687
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,559
is there actually enough information in

688
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,760
the archive to know that um tracking was

689
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
occurring or that these parties have the

690
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,080
ability to track if they chose to

691
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
uh you so the question was i believe uh

692
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,120
is there enough information in the

693
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
archive to know whether they were

694
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
actually tracking you or if they just

695
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
had the ability to what we measure is

696
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,400
the ability to track

697
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
and that's true for even the live web

698
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,159
measurements we have no idea what

699
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,600
they're doing on the other side if you

700
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
want to do that you need to get some

701
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
work where you know you see the effects

702
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
of tracking you look at the target

703
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
advertisement and see so what what's

704
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
what's your intuition between the gap

705
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
between the ability to track and actual

706
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,400
tracking just your guess

707
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,159
my guess um

708
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
it's probably not an insignificant gap

709
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,919
because you if you look at the data

710
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,240
manually you'll see a number of trackers

711
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,760
who you're not sure whether you know

712
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
i've never heard of this entity but it's

713
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,639
really hard to tell so

714
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
thanks for your really awesome talk sid

715
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,679
stam from rose holmen institute of

716
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,960
technology

717
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
so i'm curious about when you were

718
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,280
getting data out of the web archive

719
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
because

720
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
um landing pages and and deeper pages in

721
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
a website are going to have different

722
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
composition of third parties uh did you

723
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
just check the landing pages of the top

724
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
500 or did you go deeper yeah we just

725
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
checked the landing pages um

726
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
that's a limited that's definitely a

727
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,080
limitation of this work um one one of

728
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,440
the limitations that that comes from is

729
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
that unlike browsing the live web

730
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
parallelism doesn't help you with the

731
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,400
wayback machine because you're hitting

732
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,760
one set of servers and they're pretty

733
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,640
slow

734
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
um and so crawling a large number of

735
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,559
pages within each site

736
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,679
takes a very very very long time

737
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,799
but that's something that's the kind of

738
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,080
thing that in the in future work i would

739
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,320
like to explore is sort of how can we

740
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,799
get that kind of deeper into web pages

741
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,280
data out

742
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
alexis reduce google um

743
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,400
earlier on you talked about cookie-based

744
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,080
tracking is this

745
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,679
research all about cookie-based tracking

746
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,279
or did you talk did you look into other

747
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,039
things like javascript bugs and cache

748
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,640
bugs and stuff like that

749
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,320
this is all about stateful cookie-based

750
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
tracking uh we did a little bit of

751
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
analysis of we looked at for example the

752
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
use of the javascript uh local storage

753
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
api because that's another way in which

754
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
you can store state

755
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,120
in the browser but that's all that's all

756
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,480
that we looked at in this study i

757
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,320
definitely have my eyes on future work

758
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
that looks at all manner of other things

759
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,000
so if you have ideas for what you would

760
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
like to see studied longitudinally let

761
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,200
me know i'd be glad to do that thanks

762
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
rabimbo rice university

763
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,840
since you have all this data did you uh

764
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,760
try to look at if

765
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
how they track uh at like past and how

766
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
they evolved tracking did you like look

767
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
into how the measurement changed

768
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
um

769
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,159
i'm not sure i missed the middle of that

770
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,600
question at the end you said how

771
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
measurement changed

772
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,840
so uh how they used to track in 2004 or

773
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,240
how they used to track now like did you

774
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,799
see any like did you try to see that if

775
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,120
there was a change or what change

776
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,000
um

777
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
yeah so the different colored lines in

778
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,279
the figure with the gray bars are

779
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,720
different types of trackers so they have

780
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,559
different behaviors they are referring

781
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,240
to each other in different ways they're

782
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
using different techniques to track um

783
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,320
so you can see the changes in those in

784
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,240
those colored lines yeah thank you

785
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
and one more quick question um the the

786
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
20-year graph that you showed were those

787
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,679
based on the upper bound the lower bound

788
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,360
or somewhere in between uh those are

789
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
based on the lower bound those are based

790
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,600
on str on being strict about it thanks

791
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,520
oh sorry actually the first one is based

792
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,120
on that the second one with the third

793
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,760
parties is actually based on uh all

794
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
third party requests and the reason is

795
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
because with those really popular ones

796
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,320
we can afford to do a little bit of

797
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
manual analysis right doubleclick

798
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,720
appears on that

799
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,159
figure double click appears on this

800
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,720
figure for example oops back one more uh

801
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,559
which i uh the red line is double click

802
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,320
right uh which i told you doubleclick

803
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,520
doesn't have any cookies it only has

804
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,440
third party requests in the archive

805
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,240
because they block they opt out but the

806
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
reason we can do this is because we know

807
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,559
that doubleclick is a tracker we are

808
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,559
able to manually investigate that fact

809
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,720
and include it on this figure

810
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
and the manual investigation is feasible

811
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,679
because we're only having to do it for a

812
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,400
small number of trackers because the big

813
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
ones are the important ones thanks a lot

814
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,919
awesome research thank you

815
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
hi trevor pottinger from facebook um so

816
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400
there's

817
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,039
uh actually on that same slide sure

818
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,000
so

819
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,440
there a lot of these domains are

820
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,720
actually all owned by google did you

821
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,440
guys try doing any analysis of trying to

822
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
duplicate based off of which company

823
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
actually owns the domains or the

824
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
trackers that you observed no we didn't

825
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,039
uh that's something certainly that i'm

826
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,640
definitely interested in

827
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,960
but for the purposes of this we didn't

828
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
cool thank you thank you

829
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,720
one more time

830
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,039
you
