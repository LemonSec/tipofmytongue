1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,500
just Armen was the lead student on this

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,230
project he since graduated as a postdoc

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,240
now at TU delft and this project was in

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,119
collaboration obviously with tu Delft

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,759
the Dutch police the high technology

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,930
cybercrime unit of the Dutch police XE

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,210
and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,470
and will be focusing on bulletproof

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,530
hosting which some of you in the

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,430
audience might not be familiar with and

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,980
to begin with I'll kind of explain

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,810
bulletproof hosting and give you a

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,620
little bit of background on it and for

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,510
those of you not familiar with

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,820
bulletproof hosting it's kind of one of

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,309
these basic building blocks of a lot of

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,070
cybercrime right you need some server

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,380
some network connection in order to

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,390
disseminate your attacks of things and

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,509
so proof hosting is oftentimes this

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,150
basic building block that people use to

22
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:10,390
perpetrate all kinds of different scams

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,790
and what makes bulletproof hosting kind

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,700
of different from normal hosting is that

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,310
these bulletproof hosters are aware of

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,430
the abuse and they kind of proactively

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,040
protect their customers from the abuse

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,040
and I'll kind of go into details is how

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,690
do they do this proactive protection the

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,340
other thing that they also offer is kind

31
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,670
of anonymity for the customers as well

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,830
so they try and allow the content to

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,540
persist for as long as they can and they

34
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,560
protect the customers as well as they

35
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:44,610
can at the beginning of bulletproof

36
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,080
hosting we see examples like Mikola

37
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,429
Russian business Network and things like

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,830
that and these are what I would call

39
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,580
kind of static bulletproof hosters they

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,439
owned the hardware they you know had the

41
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,789
autonomous system they had the network

42
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,559
connection they owned all the

43
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,340
infrastructure and then they rented it

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,229
out to abusive customers within year but

45
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,610
of course the problem with having a

46
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,859
static thing like that is that a lot of

47
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,119
these got deep heerd so that they could

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,650
no longer peer and they would no longer

49
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,689
have network connections and their

50
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,939
server didn't get seized and then to

51
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:19,060
that and so obviously they needed to

52
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:20,560
adapt from this model and more recently

53
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,439
there's been this evolution in

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,140
bulletproof hosting where there's been a

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,660
talk by the Open DNS

56
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,869
group there and I did some previous work

57
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,709
on this kind of highlighting this

58
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,870
transformation from the static

59
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,580
bulletproof hosters to these more agile

60
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,020
hosters from here and that's what a lot

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,670
of talk is going to be giving you it's

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,080
kind of this internal insights into

63
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:46,380
these agile hosters and so these are is

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,120
kind of virtual overlay bulletproof

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,320
hosters that don't actually own any

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,660
infrastructure they're just simply

67
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,910
signing up as resellers to ISPs

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,959
oftentimes low-cost ISPs that don't

69
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,600
invest much in anti-abuse handling and

70
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,520
then they resell that to abusive

71
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,220
customers and obviously this makes it

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,870
much harder to track them and action

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,400
against them because they're mixed in

74
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,600
with this good stuff right it's just a

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,690
cheap ISP that it right just under

76
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,910
invests in security oftentimes within

77
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,340
here and so this kind of transformation

78
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,320
has obviously rendered a lot of the

79
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,209
previous defenses that we had against

80
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,790
bulletproof hosting not as effective

81
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:31,650
within here and so right this leaves us

82
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,150
with some questions okay we we are

83
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,820
dealing with this evolved bulletproof

84
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,850
hosting within year so we need to

85
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,019
understand how they're operating and

86
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,570
ideally understand how we can kind of

87
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,010
mitigate this new type of hosting and

88
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,459
within here and in order to do this I'm

89
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,298
gonna go through kind of a case study of

90
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:58,440
Maxie dead and Maxie dead was taken down

91
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,209
in 2018 legally by the Dutch police and

92
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,709
the Thai police two people the two

93
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,209
operators were arrested and this Maxie

94
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,100
dead was a very prominent bulletproof

95
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,810
poster if he went to the underground

96
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,910
cybercrime forums you'd see them

97
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,680
advertising for customers all over the

98
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,900
place so they were a fairly major player

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,539
in the bulletproof hosting space they

100
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,510
also started up another business called

101
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,820
depth file and I won't go into much

102
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,810
detail about depth file but DEP file was

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,789
a cloud file sharing platform that

104
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,950
hosted a lot of content including a lot

105
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:35,610
of child abuse material unfortunately

106
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,650
within it and right they were operated

107
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,380
by the same two people that were

108
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,320
arrested

109
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,750
and within here so through this legal

110
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,270
take on seizure by the Dutch police they

111
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,340
had a copy of the back end servers of

112
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,159
Maxie dead and that's gonna form the

113
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,429
basis of almost all of our analysis for

114
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,040
this and so within this back end we can

115
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,530
see that they had a total of fifty six

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,480
thousand different server offerings they

117
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,239
had sixty-six thousand of these were

118
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,740
purchased a lot of the server packages

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,110
actually just expired

120
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,110
and when unpurchased and within here

121
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,970
they had twenty six thousand customer

122
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,590
support tickets they they had to do a

123
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,530
lot of customer support for their

124
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,000
abusive clients there was fourteen

125
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,530
different merchants I'll get into how

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,420
Maxie did was structured but it was

127
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,659
actually just a marketplace with

128
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,400
merchants and it generated about three

129
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,920
point three million dollars in revenue

130
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,640
u.s. dollars over about seven years of

131
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,240
operation within here and so right they

132
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,669
they operated a website on this website

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,650
customers could browse different server

134
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,330
offerings within here the server

135
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,460
offerings would oftentimes tell you this

136
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,130
specification of the server where the

137
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,020
server was located and what forms of

138
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,990
abuse were allowed on this particular

139
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,400
server and allowed for different amounts

140
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,020
of least time of that particular server

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,580
and the other thing we can see from the

142
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,250
customers right one question that we

143
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,349
obviously had was a you know right this

144
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,660
is found data so was a ballad so we did

145
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,310
a lot of validation of the data to make

146
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,050
sure that at least the parts that we

147
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,060
could validate checked out so we

148
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,100
validated things like crypto currency

149
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,410
transactions we made sure that all the

150
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,210
tables were consistent and all of that

151
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,940
mostly checked out and the obvious other

152
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,830
thing is right was there actual abuse

153
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,510
happening from these servers and so

154
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,729
looking through the ticketing data we

155
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,440
can see yes that actual abuse was

156
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,910
happening so this is one where the

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,150
customer said the server stopped

158
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,290
responding provider said that they

159
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,539
discontinued that server because of

160
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,040
abuse complaints the customer said wait

161
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,080
a second I ordered one that allowed

162
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,180
abuse and then they list off all the

163
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,300
different forms of abuse that they could

164
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,830
do and then the provider said what kind

165
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,050
of abuse were you running on the server

166
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,849
and the customer says I was running

167
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,620
Homer which for those either

168
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,400
don't know is the software package that

169
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,920
does backlink spamming for search engine

170
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,599
optimization purposes within there so

171
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,340
then the operator says ok proceed you

172
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,820
you did the abuse that was allowed so

173
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,200
we're gonna rename your server then the

174
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,640
customer kind of suppresses up and they

175
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,920
say oh by the way I was running a

176
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,229
malware C&C and I was doing some DDoS

177
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,660
from there and the provider turns a

178
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,340
blind eye and continues to re-establish

179
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,440
the connection for the person so yes

180
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,599
there was actual abuse happening on

181
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,580
these servers one of the interesting

182
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,220
things though is again part of evolution

183
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,919
of things so we found that a lot of the

184
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,940
merchants operating here actually the

185
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,010
customers had to bear the cost of abuse

186
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,420
and detection of abuse and think that

187
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,550
that with an ear so a lot of the

188
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,070
merchants offloaded the cost of abuse on

189
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,700
to the customers and this is why a term

190
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,380
maybe like agile abuse enabled hosting

191
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,330
might actually be a better term than

192
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,730
bulletproof hosting for this current

193
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,250
form of hosting and so here from again

194
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,600
from the customer support tickets we can

195
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,210
see one where the customer says the

196
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,000
server is down the provider says that we

197
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,770
sim bended it for abuse complaint the

198
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,260
customer says you know I bought the

199
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,289
abuse enabled server the provider says

200
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,210
there's an abuse fee and so then the

201
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,600
customer says how much the provider says

202
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,310
$300 the customer complains that steep

203
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,130
but we can see from the payment logs

204
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,140
that they paid the $300 abuse fee their

205
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,210
server was migrated to another server

206
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,560
and Riaan Stan she ated from here so

207
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,530
this is interesting because this is a

208
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,750
decoupling of that cost risk of abuse on

209
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,729
to the customer to make the agile

210
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,919
hosters more efficient and kind of

211
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,700
aligned a sentence better between the

212
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:41,228
two parties ok so um the high-level

213
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,090
anatomy of maxi dead and the bulletproof

214
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,830
ecosystem is such right it begins with

215
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,040
the customer that's looking for the

216
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:51,340
server again maxi dead was a merchant

217
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,050
platform they also sold servers as well

218
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,920
but they were primarily a merchant

219
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:59,020
platform that had a number of merchants

220
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,870
that were offering right this

221
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,490
bulletproof hosting on the site and so

222
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,129
then these merchants right what they did

223
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,199
is they went to the upstream ISP

224
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,569
subscribed as a reseller and that's how

225
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,609
they actually got the hosting to provide

226
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:16,209
to the customers within here since this

227
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,309
is kind of how it was formed so now that

228
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:19,809
we kind of understand this form of

229
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,149
bulletproof hosting we understand the

230
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:26,019
data set I'll go into just a little bit

231
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:27,549
of the details of it so um one of the

232
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,779
things that we looked at right was kind

233
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:32,399
of the merchants behavior so again

234
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:36,369
there's these 14 merchants on here about

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,920
75% of the packages allowed abuse within

236
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:40,839
here but only for the merchants

237
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,878
accounted for almost all the sales on

238
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,470
the platform so virtually all of the

239
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,540
merchants that tried to sell server

240
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,089
package failed they either didn't sell

241
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,389
any are they sold extremely few number

242
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,739
of server packages within your and again

243
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,129
right most of the packages went

244
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:59,110
unpurchased within your the other thing

245
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,480
we can look at is the upstream providers

246
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,059
of here and so here we see a little bit

247
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,220
of concentration so there's 15 upstream

248
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:08,980
providers that provided about half of

249
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,360
the supply of the abusive servers within

250
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,920
your but then if we look a little bit

251
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,139
further we see that 57 percent or sorry

252
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,529
57 upstream providers a kind of for

253
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,240
about 80% of the abuse of the server

254
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,220
stock within your and then if we look

255
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,240
even further we see a total of almost

256
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,209
400 ISPs that were abused at some point

257
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,670
as a reseller within your and that

258
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:36,189
second figure shows kind of the overlap

259
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,839
amongst the up streams and it's kind of

260
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:39,819
hard to read but basically what it shows

261
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,540
that there's very little overlap between

262
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:45,429
the different merchants within here and

263
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,929
this kind of adds up to a few different

264
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,839
things right there's a large number of

265
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:52,059
options for these upstream service

266
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,649
Breyers probably not a really good place

267
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,449
to try and intervene on this ecosystem

268
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,269
because of the large number of options

269
00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:01,149
and the low switching cost it appears

270
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,339
that this is a demand driven business so

271
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,739
there appears to be much more supply

272
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,720
than there is demand within this and

273
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:09,730
again right there's a concentration

274
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:15,579
where a lot of the merchants fail as

275
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,929
well within this ecosystem so now we can

276
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,910
look at some of the demand based

277
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:19,660
characteristics within here which

278
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,490
essentially comes

279
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,939
down to studying the customer behavior

280
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,950
and what we were looking at here is the

281
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,870
percentage of abusive versus not an

282
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,730
abusive hosting that was purchased by

283
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,590
your and again we can see that right

284
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,550
most of the customers were purchasing

285
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,530
abusive based hosting within here the

286
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,599
other thing we can look at is right how

287
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,430
they paid for these service because this

288
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,240
is another potential disruption point

289
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:49,150
and so what we see here is that there is

290
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,040
some you know PayPal regulated payments

291
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:54,160
but the majority of is coming through

292
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,959
cryptocurrency and web money both fairly

293
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,339
unregulated payment methods and so this

294
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,350
kind of adds up to right most of these

295
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,810
payments coming through web money and

296
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,520
crypto currencies which means that that

297
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,979
payment channel is probably not that

298
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:13,780
disruptive all within your would be very

299
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,040
hard to disrupt that the next thing that

300
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm gonna look at is kind of a

301
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,000
combination of a lot of different

302
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,580
players in this ecosystem including some

303
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,140
what the defenders within your so what

304
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,180
I'm gonna look at is the server

305
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,550
lifetimes within your and this is broken

306
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,349
into different segments of here we

307
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,540
basically did some clustering and some

308
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,150
analysis to kind of bend these into the

309
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,420
no abuse servers low abuse low abuse

310
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,120
essentially means like peer-to-peer

311
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,219
file-sharing kind of intellectual

312
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,790
property infringement type things where

313
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,420
is an activity like that medium risk are

314
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,730
things like phishing sites those form

315
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,699
spamming tools like who myrrh and things

316
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,650
like that and the high risk abuse are

317
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:02,170
things like like malware C and C's DDoS

318
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,360
attacks and things of that nature within

319
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,300
here and so again right the customer can

320
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,640
choose the length of their lease and

321
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,069
within here and if we look at the abuse

322
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,290
line they choose about three months but

323
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,750
then about 15% of the servers are

324
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,920
terminated this obviously raises a red

325
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,990
flag because most people don't have

326
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,360
their servers randomly terminated ferb

327
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,700
you so we checked on the ticketing logs

328
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,200
and the customers weren't always

329
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,640
adhering to the rules of year so there

330
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,860
was abuse coming from the non-abusive

331
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,630
servers linear so this is kind of a

332
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,050
rough level of abuse is what we found

333
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,509
premiere of that they lost about 11

334
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,209
percent of the utility of the server's

335
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:44,180
due to shutdowns I'm within here in the

336
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,160
low abuse category it looks a little bit

337
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,339
similar the termination is a little bit

338
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,230
more and the lost productivity of the

339
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,970
servers is a little bit escalated as

340
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,069
well within there

341
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,779
the interesting thing is for the medium

342
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:59,000
bracket we see that the customers are

343
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,800
choosing to release these for less time

344
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,170
they probably know their activity is

345
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,660
more risky and so they're going to move

346
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,490
quicker and they want a shorter lease on

347
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,410
their server within here so they're

348
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,360
adjusting essentially because they're

349
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,490
the ones bearing the cost of that abuse

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,690
they're adjusting their behavior within

351
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,360
there so they're paying a little bit of

352
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,279
a premium for the shorter lease times

353
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,470
figuring that they lose less in terms of

354
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,959
utility and they're correct they only

355
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,850
lose about 13 days of lost productivity

356
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,040
of their server and then the high-risk

357
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,769
ones least there's for even less well

358
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,630
either immersed there's for only a month

359
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,790
within here and then we see similar

360
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,829
levels of kind of loss from the

361
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,149
defenders and sorry the customers are

362
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:40,008
smart they're adjusting and

363
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,740
unfortunately the defenders aren't

364
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:46,699
really damaging their hosting ability

365
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:49,670
that much within you so I'll go on to

366
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:51,380
the finances quickly here all right so

367
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,779
we can look at the revenue and cost

368
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,790
numbers based on the backend things and

369
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:58,399
of course right most of the revenue

370
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,759
comes from the customer payments and

371
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,339
most of the costs are them passing on

372
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,560
money to the merchants within your

373
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:10,730
effectively they collected about 10 to

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,680
15% Commission on the servers within

375
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,600
your unfortunately we can't see the full

376
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,219
scale they're costing like personnel and

377
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,589
some of the most Ceylonese costs weren't

378
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,050
in the database they weren't adhering to

379
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:25,519
GAAP accounting standards I'm within

380
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,769
there so we can see here it's kind of a

381
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,329
rough profit estimate again these are

382
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,500
kind of optimistic numbers so this is

383
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:35,359
best case kind of profits within here

384
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,209
the other thing to note is that debt

385
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,540
file is actually the largest customer of

386
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,518
maxy dead within your so depth file was

387
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,079
buying right all their hosting from

388
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,220
accident and they were by far the

389
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,880
largest customer

390
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,410
within your maxy dead made pretty

391
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,250
underwhelming profits again they had

392
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:59,060
that 3.3 million dollars and they they

393
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,430
made you know optimistically about 700 K

394
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,410
over the 7 years of operations here it's

395
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,750
a pretty low margin business again at

396
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,060
best you know retail levels about ten

397
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,670
percent margins and within their

398
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,619
business that file unfortunately on the

399
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,900
other hand was a much more profitable so

400
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,060
this was the right to the cloud file

401
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,640
hosting service that did the child abuse

402
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,979
material within here so they made

403
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,280
thirteen million dollars in revenue they

404
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,260
their profits were probably exceeded

405
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,449
four million dollars over a slightly

406
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,670
shorter period of time of five million

407
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,970
dollars within here so this kind of

408
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,479
shows you the scale of these customers

409
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,790
that were using this abuse of service

410
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,610
with an ear and right from our analysis

411
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,290
it kind of suggests that maxi dad might

412
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,930
have just been it might have been more

413
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:51,020
valuable as a source of servers to depth

414
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,510
file than the actual money that they

415
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:58,010
were profiting from selling it to other

416
00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:01,910
customers within there at the end so to

417
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,560
kind of wrap things up unfortunately it

418
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,899
looks like it's very difficult to

419
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,030
directly disrupt things right the ISP

420
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,699
level is very difficult to disrupt the

421
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:14,119
payment channel is very difficult to

422
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:18,680
disrupt right there were only the for

423
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:20,448
successful merchants but it's unless you

424
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,010
had the database you couldn't know who

425
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,350
those four merchants were that wasn't

426
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,390
externally visible to the customers

427
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,159
within here that was all hidden from the

428
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,850
customer as to who the actual merchant

429
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,010
was so would it it would probably be a

430
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:38,840
hard investigation to figure out who the

431
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:41,480
merchants were within their take down is

432
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,949
of course an option within here but of

433
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,470
course this was right this was probably

434
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,230
a very expensive investigation for the

435
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,480
Dutch anti-police to execute within year

436
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,910
we have of course the alternative of you

437
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,290
know raising operational costs so

438
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,990
perhaps if we could make better

439
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,840
detection mechanisms kind of eat into

440
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,390
the utility timer there's

441
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,030
servers make it more expensive to

442
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,500
operate then obviously those costs would

443
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,050
have to be passed on to their customers

444
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,030
and that would you know slowly

445
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,760
deteriorate the revenue and hopefully

446
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,950
disincentivize more and more people from

447
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,140
right committing the crimes in the first

448
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,580
place with an you're so right this all

449
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,050
leads to us kind of needing more

450
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,699
research within your like that cool

451
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,950
research that we did on the targeted

452
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,930
spearfishing kind of stuff and the other

453
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:29,080
phishing attacks we need more of that in

454
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,810
this bulletproof hosting space kind of

455
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,720
focused on the agile hosting and so with

456
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,190
that I'd like to thank you and again

457
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,500
Armen did most of this work with an ear

458
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,450
here's his contact information and I'm

459
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,640
very it's um it's unfortunate that I'm

460
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:51,460
giving the talk instead of him so thank

461
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:54,190
you very much hey a couple questions

462
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,970
right hi adventure from Cisco thanks for

463
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,490
the presentation

464
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,530
so essentially you stumbled on this

465
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,540
goldmine of this one particular holster

466
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,520
right and can you give me an intuition

467
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,320
of what the the rest of the malicious

468
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,520
ecosystem looks like so the rest of the

469
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,280
bulletproof hosting is do you think it's

470
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,050
similar you know my suspicion is that

471
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,550
there's still some of monolithic for the

472
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,310
people that want really stable hosting

473
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,260
but those are kind of hidden behind VPNs

474
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,510
and proxies and most of the stuff that's

475
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,430
exposed it isn't running behind VPNs and

476
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,129
proxies it's gonna be this agile hosting

477
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,960
pretty much oh and this is a much larger

478
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,030
segment of the market these days is

479
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,310
agile hosting its it's just natural

480
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,080
evolution that they've evolved beyond

481
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:36,149
the you know blacklisting and other

482
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,740
interventions that people have thanks

483
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,260
hello I'm Jeffrey Goldberg from

484
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,800
1password and in a previous life I was a

485
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,590
postmaster ah and I'm just wondering

486
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,710
whether you looked at all or have any

487
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:55,149
sense of the efficacy of the various

488
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:58,930
forms of blacklisting of networks and of

489
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,490
upstream networks you should mention

490
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,860
that question unfortunately this isn't

491
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,930
super readable but this is our analysis

492
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,610
of a whole bunch of blacklist and the

493
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,210
intersection with the hosting and the

494
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:14,168
bottom line is that there's almost none

495
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:16,509
I'm sorry to disappoint you but

496
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:22,389
yeah we looked at that and there's very

497
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:24,309
