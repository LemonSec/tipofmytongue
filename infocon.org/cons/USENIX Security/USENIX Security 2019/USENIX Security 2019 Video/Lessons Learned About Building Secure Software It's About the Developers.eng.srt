1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,070
well for coming just one one brief one

2
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:19,080
brief correction the

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,410
I certainly worked on the the multics

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,439
penetration test but the the report

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,300
report was actually by my delight Paul

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,259
Carter and and Roger shell

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,700
who were Air Force officers at the time

8
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:35,340
more of that history if you want to

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,280
catch me at the at the end but what I

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,589
want to talk about today as as Alex said

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:47,070
was how we how we got to the commitment

12
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:50,070
to secure development at Microsoft and

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,930
what the things are that that made it

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,890
work and some of the things that that we

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,550
take away today so so to do that I'm

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:05,399
gonna do a lot a slide of sort of the

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:08,820
prehistory that that that got people

18
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:11,369
focused on software security and and how

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,330
that that Bears or how that bore on on

20
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:18,720
what Microsoft did a lot of history of

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,630
the SDL including the origins of the

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,210
trustworthy computing email some of the

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,080
some of the inside story that that

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,089
caused that to be released and some of

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,789
the relationships between that and some

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,759
other things that that made it work and

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,299
then after going through a lot of sides

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,680
on on SDL i'll talk about some things

29
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:47,850
that that made a difference to to making

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,399
SDL adopted and and effective in in in

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,020
microsoft and in the industry and then

32
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,200
i'm going to look back because the SDL

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,850
was actually 15 years old this summer

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,829
and you know what's changed and what

35
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,969
what you know what what things are

36
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,669
important today in in secure development

37
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,600
that are that are different from from

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:16,859
from those early days hopefully do that

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,019
do that do that in like 40 45 ish

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,420
that's an hour slot do that in like 45

41
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,750
ish minutes and have have lots of time

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:31,339
for questions or

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:34,130
or pushback so in the in the 1990s from

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,090
a microsoft perspective the company was

45
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:41,780
working with the the company had Windows

46
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:46,460
3.1 you know about 3.1 it was you know

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,400
sort of an overlay on dos no aspirations

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,150
to security and it ended it achieved

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,360
that very well we were we were we were

50
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,920
that we they and I think of Microsoft as

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,830
we although I didn't I didn't join the

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,390
Captain Hilton on 99 we're also working

53
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:12,140
on Windows NT and he was and a successor

54
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:14,119
or evolution of VMs intended as a sort

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:18,920
of a modern state-of-the-art operating

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,700
system and and and you know taking

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,220
taking some of the lessons learned from

58
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,959
from VMs to the extent there were there

59
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,030
were significant security aspirations

60
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,459
but those aspirations were sort of

61
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,640
formed by the orange book again by the

62
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,950
the DoD evaluation criteria and focused

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,820
on security features was which was what

64
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:47,679
the evaluation community did back in the

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:47,680
90s and still still sort of does in 2019

66
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,970
lessons learned started in the in the in

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,330
the mid-90s you know sort of what I

68
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,320
think of as as as commodity commodity

69
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:07,459
commodity attacks on commodity software

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:10,010
the the frack issue on on smashing the

71
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:13,340
stack for fun and profit came out in the

72
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,130
mid-90s that made people broadly aware

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,168
of buffer overruns people the buffer

74
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,690
overruns had been in had been discovered

75
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:26,750
before that but but but you know but but

76
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,640
but but the the Frank issue I think was

77
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,010
was really the thing that that told

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,060
everybody you know hey and you can do

79
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,219
this too there were lots of other

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,740
mistakes in the

81
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:44,350
in the in the 90s we the Internet

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,200
Explorer was was released Internet

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,680
Explorer shows the active acts

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,280
extensibility model and there was

85
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,670
something called the internet exploder

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,669
you have to read the type carefully to

87
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:04,570
see that internet exploder was a was an

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:08,170
ActiveX plug-in that would download run

89
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:11,920
on your run on your your browser and and

90
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,620
crash it and so you know just just to

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,290
demonstrate just to demonstrate that

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,190
that Microsoft had had not gotten that

93
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,920
not gotten that aspect of things right

94
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:27,550
and and lots of lots of other things as

95
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,140
well there became in industry in finding

96
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,480
vulnerabilities in Microsoft software

97
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,860
reporting them to Microsoft or maybe in

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,030
the early days just putting them out on

99
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,900
the web on the on on some of the some of

100
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:46,479
the email on some of the early email

101
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,960
lists I remember having to read bug

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,200
track when I when I joined when I joined

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,530
Microsoft as a way of tracking what was

104
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,360
going on in response Microsoft created

105
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,599
what they called the Security Response

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,820
Team started issuing security bulletins

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,350
in response to newly discovered

108
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:13,570
vulnerabilities pre and then and then

109
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:16,240
issuing issuing patches in to try to try

110
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:20,169
to fix the bugs that were reported and

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,210
and verified internally they also

112
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:26,349
created something called the security

113
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:30,010
task force which was an assembly of the

114
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,780
people at Microsoft who who who

115
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,120
understood or thought they understood

116
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,280
something about software security trying

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,030
to figure out you know what what could

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,989
what could they what could we do about

119
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:46,869
this sort of onslaught or maybe steady

120
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,030
drip of vulnerability reports against

121
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,289
Microsoft products one of the outcomes

122
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,619
of

123
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,818
you can find it on the web it was a

124
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:57,969
paper entitled of threats to our

125
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:02,259
products which was a first cut at an

126
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:05,019
approach to design analysis that they we

127
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,999
they referred to as threat modeling I'll

128
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,059
talk more about threat modeling and in

129
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:14,289
the in the subsequent slides but that

130
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:16,839
that was actually in in early 99 and one

131
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:19,029
of the other things that that was done

132
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,969
was to create something called the

133
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:24,459
secure windows initiative and the spear

134
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:28,569
witness initiative was a team of three

135
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:31,389
program managers in the Microsoft the

136
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,819
windows secure features security

137
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,469
security feature team and those three

138
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:38,050
program managers count them one two

139
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:40,869
three were charged with finding the

140
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,749
security bugs in Windows and filing bugs

141
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:46,779
so that people would fix them okay three

142
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:50,679
program managers maybe 48 million lines

143
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:58,089
of code you can do the math but that it

144
00:07:50,679 --> 00:08:02,888
was a kinder gentler era in in in 99 to

145
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:04,959
2001 I joined Microsoft in late 99 as

146
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,319
the manager of the security response

147
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,019
team which we we we labeled the Security

148
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,439
Response Center and added added a batch

149
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:18,239
of of program managers to to try to keep

150
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:22,269
up with what was then an onslaught of

151
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:23,498
bugs and maybe also try to try to try to

152
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,709
see what we could do to make things

153
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,599
better the secure windows initiative

154
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:34,209
team I'll probably pronounce it as sly

155
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:37,688
as I go change its focus from from

156
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:41,318
finding the bugs themselves to training

157
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:43,808
product component groups you know all

158
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:47,259
the different all the different teams

159
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:49,329
within windows that were building

160
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,220
various components you know how do you

161
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,870
how do you look at your code how do you

162
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,750
find places where there might be

163
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,079
vulnerabilities how do you code so you

164
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,810
don't have and you don't have security

165
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,609
vulnerabilities and and and fixing them

166
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:08,630
we had this thing called a bug bash

167
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,150
where we'd spend the morning doing doing

168
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,670
secure development and secure security

169
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,319
testing training and then the afternoon

170
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,540
people would would look at their

171
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,660
components trying to say okay these are

172
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,209
these are the the security the security

173
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,800
bugs that we can find and file bugs in

174
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,460
the work flow system to actually get

175
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,849
them fixed

176
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,860
there was some other work done as well

177
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:36,640
talk a little more about that in the in

178
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:39,530
this in the slide to come in late 2000

179
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,140
there was something that where I don't I

180
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:45,439
don't think is widely remembered but at

181
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,160
the time it was it was a big deal and it

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,510
was it was very much noticed internally

183
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,589
there was an intrusion into the

184
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,090
Microsoft corporate network and you know

185
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,060
this was this was sort of an early

186
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,160
advanced persistent threat attack and

187
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,250
that got a lot of executive attention

188
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,560
you know how did this happen what do we

189
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,000
need to be doing to keep that sort of

190
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,890
thing from happening again

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,880
what do we need to be doing to keep it

192
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,589
from happening to our customers and so

193
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,030
you know that was that was an initiative

194
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:24,410
talk about that and in a minute in 2001

195
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,000
Code Red I assume people there are

196
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:31,160
people in the room who remember code

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,310
read that that attacked the iis web

198
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:40,040
server eius web servers on the on the on

199
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:42,709
the internet and and it it did that by

200
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,579
exploiting a vulnerability in a

201
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,800
component or that was that most people

202
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,890
didn't need but that was developed in

203
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,839
abled by default you know you'll hear

204
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,480
more about enabling by default in a

205
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,810
couple of slides Code Red was followed

206
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,800
in a couple of months later by ninda

207
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:07,550
which actually had four separate vectors

208
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,550
of attack of different components of

209
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,420
Windows it also exploited a

210
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,810
vulnerability in IAS and

211
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:20,410
and and got and and so crashed crashed

212
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:23,260
web servers on the internet there were

213
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,020
there was press about Code Red and nimda

214
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,300
and each of though each of those those

215
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,480
press reports attributed like eight

216
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,990
billion dollars worth of aggregate

217
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,960
customer cost to cleaning up the damage

218
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:41,290
from Code Red and nimda and then in into

219
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,340
that later in 2001 2011 was really sort

220
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:50,560
of a banner year we had we had released

221
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,960
in Windows XP in August and later in the

222
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,550
year there was what was called the UPnP

223
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,110
vulnerability in in in XP which which

224
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,170
I'm not convinced was ever actually

225
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,480
exploited but there was one vector that

226
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,939
made the government afraid that we were

227
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,430
going to start taking government sites

228
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,190
off the network or launching DDoS

229
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,770
attacks against the government and so a

230
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,770
lot of a lot of news a lot of press a

231
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,720
lot of concern and the Seattle

232
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,150
post-intelligencer was then the local

233
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,600
paper and people became aware gee you

234
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,240
know this is something that that

235
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:33,310
customers are concerned about the the

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,020
story the story as well was that along

237
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,410
about that time we got to the point

238
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:41,170
where customers were were calling

239
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,630
Microsoft executives and then instead of

240
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,209
talking to him about you know business

241
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,800
or new opportunities or new sales they

242
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,160
were yelling at him about their bad

243
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,250
security and my friend my friend John

244
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,730
Pescatore from Gartner issued a report

245
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,210
that said hey maybe if you're using is

246
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:04,150
for your web server on the Internet

247
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:08,950
Yatta stop and so that was another

248
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:11,520
attention getter after the corpnet

249
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,590
attack would go back and forth a little

250
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,660
Howard Schmidt who was then the chief

251
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,060
security officer at Microsoft and Craig

252
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,630
Mundy who was one of the the chief

253
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,550
technology officers started to meet and

254
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,130
work together Howard came to work for

255
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:31,469
Craig and they started to say

256
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:34,860
okay what could we really do to to get

257
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:39,070
the head of this to change this dynamic

258
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,260
to get the company both more secure more

259
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:45,160
secure and perceived as more secure by

260
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,530
by customers and that led to the sort of

261
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,319
thing that that you see at big companies

262
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,720
a lot of meetings a lot of emails a lot

263
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,840
of briefings a lot of demonstrations

264
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,810
including demonstrations for the the

265
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:03,340
most senior management of the company

266
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:08,109
and that that ran from through 2001 and

267
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:11,260
into early 2002 in parallel with that

268
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:14,680
Michael Howard and David LeBlanc wrote

269
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,860
the the writing secure code book which

270
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,859
came out in late 2001 and said okay

271
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,020
these are the things that we know about

272
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:27,880
building secure software in in C and C++

273
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:31,540
talked about design as well as code

274
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:34,300
level variety of techniques if you if

275
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,589
you followed you know if you followed

276
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,740
what's in writing secure code

277
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:42,130
religiously you'd be building a lot

278
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:48,340
better code than you know in in the late

279
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:52,600
90s Microsoft was and then in in you

280
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:56,680
know in early 2002 the payoff from the

281
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,160
the Howard and Craig initiative was the

282
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,040
the trustworthy computing email and that

283
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,390
was an email to all all employees and

284
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,030
made public from Bill Gates that said

285
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,460
hey you know this is this is a serious

286
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,370
matter we have to commit to security we

287
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:19,420
have to prioritize security over over

288
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:22,480
features we have to we have to to do

289
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,120
things that do things in a different way

290
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,880
to protect our customers security

291
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,230
privacy and and other attributes of

292
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:38,010
trustworthiness and that came out and in

293
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:39,410
response my friend my friend Pescatore

294
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,810
who

295
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:45,410
who who was a little bit of a skeptic

296
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:47,719
back in those days issued a report I

297
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,149
couldn't find the exact wording but you

298
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,949
know the approximation as Microsoft has

299
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,839
this terrible product security problem

300
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:57,019
and in response to that problem they've

301
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:04,660
issued a press release so you know so

302
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:08,870
you know so commitment but skepticism in

303
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:12,170
in parallel with the run that led up to

304
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,740
the trustworthy computing email those of

305
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:19,639
us in in Windows security you know sort

306
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,920
of closer to the trenches were were

307
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:28,819
worrying about you know what could we do

308
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:30,620
I had changed jobs in in mid-2001 and in

309
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:34,490
addition to the Security Response Center

310
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,829
I was I moved into I moved into the the

311
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,050
Windows security team and and also

312
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,479
inherited responsibility for the for the

313
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,540
secure Windows initiative team and we

314
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,889
had an off-site meeting you know what

315
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,689
are we going to do you know what's our

316
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,550
budget what are our hiring plans what

317
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:52,610
are our deliverables and what are we

318
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:57,079
going to do about this this big problem

319
00:16:52,610 --> 00:17:01,000
that's running and we had this off-site

320
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:04,879
meeting sort of late October of oh one

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,059
at a time when the dotnet common

322
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,240
language runtime team was about to ship

323
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,250
their version one and they knew that

324
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,880
security was important they wanted to

325
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:19,280
compete with Java they wanted to be a

326
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,880
major force in the managed code space

327
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,339
and they kept finding security bugs and

328
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,630
they said what do you know how are we

329
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,030
gonna how are we going to get ahead of

330
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,700
this so that we don't just you know have

331
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:34,970
this drip of security bugs coming at us

332
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:38,200
when we when we ship and they decided

333
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:41,900
what we're going to do is delay shipping

334
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,840
stop work on features and focus

335
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:50,520
everybody on doing security reviews and

336
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:53,639
security testing and they they did that

337
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,730
and the process was going on Michael and

338
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,460
David LeBlanc were involved in it

339
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,860
they were both at this off-site meeting

340
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,510
and and they said you know they talked

341
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,110
about what was happening and how it was

342
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,600
going and I said you know that's that's

343
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,919
an approach and I said well what would

344
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,580
happen if we did that on the next

345
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:19,590
windows release and nobody and then the

346
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:22,220
consensus of the meeting was that a that

347
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,070
was a big lift you know windows was like

348
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:29,730
8500 developers and B nobody had any

349
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:32,280
better ideas so I went to my boss and I

350
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,920
said let's just stop development on

351
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,580
Windows and focus everybody on security

352
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,760
and my boss said how would you get

353
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,040
people to do that they just rolled their

354
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,410
eyes when we briefed them and then go

355
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,020
back to doing business as usual you

356
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,930
wouldn't be able to get it to work but

357
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,300
he said he didn't he didn't say stop he

358
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,450
said come back and answer some list of

359
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,520
questions so I came back to him and said

360
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,710
okay this is you know this is how we do

361
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,300
it this is you know how he'd organize it

362
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:08,100
these are the resources we need and so

363
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:10,110
on and he didn't he didn't say yes but

364
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,060
he didn't say no and the next meeting

365
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,820
was with the vice president who ran

366
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,370
Windows Server and you know sort of

367
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,189
rinse and repeat we kept going up the

368
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,050
management chain with nobody saying yes

369
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,130
but nobody telling me to go away and

370
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,230
never come back

371
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,840
and finally we met with Jim Allchin the

372
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,480
group vice president who basically owned

373
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,250
most of the most of the many of the

374
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,670
software products everything but office

375
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,200
and and Jim's question was okay when do

376
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,230
you want me to preempt the conference

377
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,170
center so we can train everybody and we

378
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,930
said how about the the end of the last

379
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:49,650
week in January and so the last week in

380
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:52,020
January we preempted the conference

381
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,840
center there was a room that held 900

382
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,360
people there and we did 10 training

383
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,290
sessions morning and afternoon over five

384
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,820
days and trained about 8,500 developers

385
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:08,379
and here's a trick

386
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:11,260
okay people who are in in in or big

387
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:14,320
organizations know about mandatory

388
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,900
trainings you show up the vice-president

389
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,419
walks in he tell or if it's an orbit

390
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,070
academic institution the Dean walks in

391
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,400
he tells you why this is really

392
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:27,520
important and then and then and then he

393
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,670
walks out or she walks out and the and

394
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,490
and the training starts well in this

395
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,610
case the the vice president's for the

396
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,280
various component groups in Windows

397
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,790
showed up gave the introduction told

398
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,190
people while why why this was important

399
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:47,530
and then sat down and sat through the

400
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,900
four hours of training and that's a

401
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:53,070
message to the culture and there are

402
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,260
things like that that worked for us

403
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,570
through the through the security push

404
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,930
and actually through the rollout of SDL

405
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:04,480
that that sent the organization the

406
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,550
message that we were serious about this

407
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,540
and we actually wanted to build more

408
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:13,149
secure software so we did the security

409
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,300
push we got a commitment for one month

410
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:19,660
we extended it to two months there's a

411
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:22,780
list of things that that we did on the

412
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,150
slide we actually inventoried all the

413
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,889
components in Windows and said okay who

414
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:32,860
has to sign off on each one we did our

415
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,890
then version of threat modeling I'll

416
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:38,620
come back to that yet one more time well

417
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,740
the the preview is that that the guy who

418
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,379
later became my boss was so mad at the

419
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,290
quality of our modeling guidance that he

420
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,600
yelled at me in the hall which was was

421
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,480
not his style

422
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,129
we had some static analysis capability

423
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,430
we had bought a company called intrinsic

424
00:21:54,130 --> 00:22:00,820
and we started running that and auto

425
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:03,750
filing bugs where we thought they would

426
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,960
help us find buffer overrun

427
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:09,659
that vulnerabilities we told people you

428
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,900
know that remember remember about Code

429
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,580
Red and nimda exploiting vulnerabilities

430
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,179
and features that people didn't know

431
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,010
they had and and and weren't using we

432
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,860
told people if you've got stuff like

433
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,690
that turn it off

434
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,059
discoverability means that your your

435
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,000
system is owned by exploitation of a

436
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:32,490
vulnerability in a feature you didn't

437
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,370
need and so we said turn it off and get

438
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:40,230
people a way to turn it back on and we

439
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:42,389
also took a perspective that we didn't

440
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,610
want people trying to decide whether

441
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:48,450
something was exploitable or not

442
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:51,539
if it meets these criteria fix it okay

443
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,280
and that created a lot of code churn but

444
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,710
it also enabled us to find a batch of

445
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,100
vulnerabilities and get them and and and

446
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:05,780
and get them fixed

447
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:08,879
we ran the process through the windows

448
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,289
development process through the through

449
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,760
the windows development process through

450
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,429
the windows development team you know

451
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,679
Windows is sort of a machine you know

452
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:20,159
they you know they have a cadence of

453
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,700
daily meetings reviews bug triage what

454
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,070
have you and and we just said all right

455
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,419
building secure code as part of building

456
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:32,879
windows and so we did did the secure the

457
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,190
security push as part of the windows

458
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,990
development process and I think that was

459
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,130
sort of key to our actually getting it

460
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:44,039
done at scale I said we stopped for two

461
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:47,549
months we probably delayed Windows by

462
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:55,049
six months by the time all was said and

463
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:58,230
done and that more or less worked we we

464
00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:01,139
we we shipped Windows Server 2003 in the

465
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,270
spring of 2003 it looked like a much

466
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,110
more secure release than its

467
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,120
predecessors and and we sort of had had

468
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:13,080
turned things around to a significant

469
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,959
extent in the the secure windows

470
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,080
initiative team we built we ramped up to

471
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,470
a significant

472
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,260
a couple of dozen three dozen people

473
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,870
with the capabilities shown on the slide

474
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,690
security science was our name for

475
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:32,620
finding new classes of vulnerabilities

476
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:34,900
and and and being able to find ways of

477
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,090
fixing them and in a couple of cases we

478
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,660
were actually able to do that find a

479
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:43,000
vulnerability build a tool scan for all

480
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,700
the instances of that and eliminate it

481
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,820
before the vulnerability researchers

482
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,400
ever got the MS are seeing in business

483
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,710
to fix it externally so that that was

484
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,790
counted as success it's something that

485
00:24:53,710 --> 00:25:00,040
that still goes on we we are we

486
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:02,889
replicated the Windows security push for

487
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,320
other products we released a service

488
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:09,190
pack from the security push on sequel

489
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,409
server the week of slammer and that was

490
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,500
always something I found sad because

491
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:17,230
that was a huge worm that affected the

492
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,560
previous version of slammer and then

493
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,120
once we released that service pack

494
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,980
security push service pack the

495
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,820
vulnerability right in sequel just

496
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:30,910
dropped like a stone so so that was that

497
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,330
was sort of a sad event but but probably

498
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:37,510
a happier outcome in the long run

499
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:41,230
Blaster caused us to focus on XP the

500
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:46,120
client desktop we did more on on on

501
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:49,930
Windows XP and and probably set back the

502
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,540
Windows scheduled by another year taking

503
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:56,020
the time to go back and do some set of

504
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,639
security changes to two XP not as many

505
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,450
as we would have if it had been a full

506
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,190
release but but but we but more than

507
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,570
more than we had initially had the

508
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:10,330
appetite for in in the winter and spring

509
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:13,000
of oh four had a batch of conversations

510
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,129
you know we're not we're not there yet

511
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,120
we need to do more we need to do this on

512
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:22,540
a sustainable basis you know could we do

513
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,330
something that would be mandatory we put

514
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:30,010
together a proposal brief Ballmer and

515
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:33,070
his staff Ballmer turn turn

516
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,900
to me to his his turned to me and said

517
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,090
it that's approved he turned to his

518
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,350
staff and said okay we're not ever going

519
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,459
to talk about this again

520
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:45,100
it's done and that was the commitment to

521
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,650
enable us to put a mandatory set of

522
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:51,520
security measures into development for

523
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,300
all time and in July of oh four we

524
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,570
released

525
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:58,450
SDL version two which was a training

526
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:02,830
requirement basically the same technical

527
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:05,230
stuff we did in in the security push and

528
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:09,189
a final security review which I'll talk

529
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:11,800
about in a couple of slides and this is

530
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:14,020
just the picture from a little later in

531
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,860
the history of SDL that sort of gives

532
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:23,980
you a feel for what we did in the in in

533
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:26,830
the SDL we were we were very you know

534
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,830
this is still a list of sort of generic

535
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:32,020
things but we were very specific I mean

536
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,110
we said you know what you had to fuzz

537
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,920
and how many hundred thousand iterations

538
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:41,229
you had to fuzz without finding a

539
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:45,280
owner ability we said what specific

540
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:48,880
static analysis errors you had to fix so

541
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:53,470
very specific and mandatory for products

542
00:27:48,880 --> 00:28:00,370
that that connected to the internet and

543
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:03,640
the S the thus Y team supported the the

544
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,409
process but but the secure development

545
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,330
was done by the development groups

546
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,970
you'll hear me repeat that over and over

547
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:13,540
because it's important we had we had

548
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:15,160
like you know by the time you know after

549
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,940
multiple reorganizations and a lot of

550
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:21,240
growth you know the the security the SDL

551
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:25,300
team at Microsoft was about 60 people

552
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,330
sounds like a lot the the developer

553
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:33,370
population that we were responsible for

554
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:35,949
was about 40,000 so you know so the only

555
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:40,419
way to do that is is with tools and

556
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,880
training verification we said it was

557
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,660
mandatory what we meant by that was that

558
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,300
you had to

559
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,000
the requirements in the SDL if we said

560
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:52,139
fixed static analysis error one two

561
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,570
three four and you had and you had

562
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:59,350
static analysis error one two three four

563
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:04,960
that was a ship stopper or or an

564
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:06,149
escalation and and and we we also said

565
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,410
you can't ship with known

566
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,660
vulnerabilities there was a sometimes a

567
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,490
penetration testing bomb component

568
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,490
obviously you wouldn't ship with with

569
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:18,160
public vulnerabilities but but in them

570
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:23,800
in the main what we wanted people to do

571
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:25,690
was do the SDL we at one point one of

572
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,570
the one of the product groups came to us

573
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,220
and said hey we've just heard disk on

574
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,409
we've just discovered this thing called

575
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,320
the SDL we haven't done anything about

576
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:38,140
it what what can you do for us and we

577
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,669
said we can tell you not to ship and so

578
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,290
they went back and fix it there are

579
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:46,800
other there are other stories about

580
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:49,750
about things early on it was pretty raw

581
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,000
I told you about my the guy who became

582
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,670
my boss yelling at me about threat

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,790
modeling threat modeling for a long time

584
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:03,150
was great if you were a security expert

585
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:06,280
and otherwise too hard to ill structured

586
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:08,500
some of the tools were unusable

587
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,340
some of them were were less than

588
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:16,000
productive the services team you know

589
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,340
the online services msn hotmail you know

590
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,250
they were releasing updates every day

591
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,470
every week you know you've said you saw

592
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,960
that slide with the picture on it it

593
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,630
looks like a three-year waterfall cycle

594
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,030
you know how are we going to do this and

595
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:37,000
so there was a lot of feedback and a lot

596
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:40,120
of work to do but but we had said that

597
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,820
we were going to you know that the SDL

598
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,919
wasn't a finished thing it was something

599
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,379
that was going to iterate and that was

600
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,010
part of the approval we got and so we

601
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,929
were updating every six to twelve months

602
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:56,690
based on product group feedback

603
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:59,029
and an advice and telling us that stuff

604
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,610
wasn't usable or was usable or wasn't

605
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:05,990
needed or was needed the other big thing

606
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:07,779
is the nsrc cases we didn't say all the

607
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,110
vulnerabilities are going to go away

608
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:13,669
what we said is that as we find them as

609
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,990
people report new vulnerabilities or new

610
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:16,610
classes vulnerabilities

611
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,509
we're going to figure out where they

612
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:23,600
come came from and try to add to the SDL

613
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:29,419
things that will enable us to extinguish

614
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,860
those either by removing them or you

615
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:36,230
know the next slot and the next bullet

616
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:38,658
has a the word mitigations our what we

617
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:41,149
meant by mitigation was if the

618
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:44,210
vulnerability is still there but you can

619
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,639
include a control that will make it non

620
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,190
exploitable or make it hard to exploit

621
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:51,469
or make it a crasher instead of an

622
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,480
escalation of privilege you know that's

623
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,779
still something that we're happy to do

624
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,389
and so things like address space

625
00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:01,879
randomization non-executable stack and

626
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:04,850
heat eventually control flow integrity

627
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:08,689
were things that we mandated as part of

628
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:10,490
the SDL to to make it harder to exploit

629
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,249
vulnerabilities if they were still there

630
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,990
and scaled you know I talked to you

631
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:18,740
about Ballmer saying that there were

632
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:21,049
40,000 developers we realized that we

633
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,629
started out doing you know individual

634
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:26,570
training in a room switched fairly

635
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:30,049
quickly to online we started out with a

636
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:33,279
lot of manual requirements we knew we

637
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:36,379
were gonna have to build tools and we an

638
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,759
interesting thing that people we

639
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:39,590
initially didn't realize we were gonna

640
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,799
have to do when we started we were

641
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:45,649
tracking product teams implementation of

642
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,629
the SDL on a program managers whiteboard

643
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:50,658
and in spreadsheets and scraps of paper

644
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:52,719
and we fairly quickly discovered that we

645
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:57,950
were going to need an automated system

646
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,720
and you know to let people understand

647
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,210
what requirements applied to what they

648
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,240
were building and to tell us whether

649
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:07,220
they had done the SDL and part of the

650
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,730
trick there was making that seamless

651
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:13,580
I've got

652
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:17,450
more about that in another slide so

653
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:19,879
let's see that so so back to the product

654
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,070
team complaints they said threat

655
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,500
modeling was too hard

656
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:29,810
a fella named Shawn Hernan who is one of

657
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,480
our program managers came up with a new

658
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:35,270
much more structured way to do threat

659
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,700
modeling we built a tool that

660
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,139
implemented that it's a free download

661
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,650
from the Microsoft site if you're

662
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,210
interested and we we we never mandated

663
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,620
if people were security experts and they

664
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,010
wanted to do a different way that was

665
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:51,709
fine but we we built that tool and and

666
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:54,170
used it for for many of the new products

667
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,450
it was much more effective and and you

668
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,940
didn't have to be a super security

669
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:02,420
expert to get do threat modeling and get

670
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,610
results we fixed the tools obviously for

671
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,430
usability where we could sometimes if

672
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,900
there was a tool that was bad but the

673
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,639
alternative was shipping with

674
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,360
vulnerabilities that we didn't know any

675
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,219
any other way to find we said suck it up

676
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,880
and use that tool because it's still

677
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:22,310
better than patching them one by one we

678
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:27,110
deprecated tools that didn't work we

679
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:32,449
adapted the process to to fit into an

680
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:39,140
agile or DevOps life cycle and and and

681
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:42,439
published that so lessons learned it

682
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:44,870
worked I'm long gone from Microsoft

683
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:50,450
things have changed a lot but the SDL

684
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:53,210
still lives the reason it worked the

685
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:55,520
reason it lives is because developers

686
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,800
want to do the right thing when you

687
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,440
publish something about Microsoft

688
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,050
security sucks on the front page of the

689
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,810
Seattle post-intelligencer intelligence

690
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:09,080
er you know that gets people's attention

691
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:12,920
when Bill Gates says we need to do this

692
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,290
to continue to survive as a company that

693
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,910
gets people's attention and the

694
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:20,920
developers want to do the right thing

695
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:24,160
and that's key you can't you can't

696
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,980
compliance security in two big products

697
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:32,078
you have to build it in as part of

698
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:36,490
building and and and so you know that's

699
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,400
that's a huge lesson learned people

700
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,319
people tell me if they if they have some

701
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,010
other model of doing security people

702
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:49,509
tell me that the SDL is penetrating

703
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:54,940
patch know the SDL is continuous

704
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:58,420
improvement find a problem find the root

705
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,630
cause and eliminate it for all time and

706
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:07,690
that's got to be the secret to to

707
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:09,510
building secure software yeah talked

708
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,490
about that got him ahead of myself

709
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,920
automated tools important integrating

710
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:17,709
into the development workflow I talked

711
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,819
about tracking systems we eventually got

712
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:24,220
the SDL requirements so they just

713
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:27,940
populated into the developers bug

714
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:30,279
tracking systems you fix the bug it's a

715
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,289
flagged bug so the SDL team can go look

716
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:34,359
and see how did you do everything you're

717
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:38,019
supposed to but it's just part of the

718
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:40,420
workflow and that's a key to success

719
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:42,700
with a secure development process it's

720
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,980
just part of the workflow it's just part

721
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,529
of what the developers do they get a bug

722
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,660
they fix the bug it was a security bug

723
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:51,990
and they've they've met the SDL

724
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:58,960
requirements and that's super important

725
00:36:51,990 --> 00:37:01,479
I it's worked part of the reason I think

726
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,960
that you know these are very you know

727
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,079
these are sort of fluffy metrics but but

728
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,839
they're real customers don't customers

729
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,869
talk to Microsoft executives about

730
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,170
features or prices or orders or what

731
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:20,829
they want next we're not in the days of

732
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:23,289
yelling at executives about our bad

733
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:27,759
security anymore and that was a huge

734
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:29,980
change industry you know they're

735
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:32,079
companies some of them I think probably

736
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,739
represented in this room have

737
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,539
have adopted the SDL or adapted or

738
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:39,279
emulated at some of them have

739
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:41,939
acknowledged that some of them haven't

740
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:45,130
we don't care we released it publicly

741
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:47,229
didn't care we released it publicly and

742
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,079
the important thing was to make them

743
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:52,959
more in the industry more secure you

744
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,539
know final final how do I know it worked

745
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:58,269
tracked the price of a Windows O'Day I

746
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:00,309
actually heard that from a very

747
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:01,839
well-known vulnerability researcher it

748
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:04,569
didn't occur to me that that was the

749
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,929
metric for how secure development

750
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:11,349
process had worked so a couple of more

751
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:15,519
slides you know what what's changed in

752
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:20,439
15 years when we built the SDL we

753
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:22,390
worried about C C++ and C sharp I was

754
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:25,538
talking with some folks at Microsoft a

755
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:27,729
week ago and and I said you must you

756
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:30,699
must be you must be worrying about 10 or

757
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:31,959
15 languages now and they said I you

758
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:35,920
know something like I wish it were that

759
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:39,969
small a number you know it's it's it's

760
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,249
part of what it is but the the the

761
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:45,969
fundamentals are still the same for

762
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:48,459
every for every language that you're

763
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:51,729
using you've got to figure out how to

764
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:53,979
assure security for code in that

765
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:58,229
language and then you've got to provide

766
00:38:53,979 --> 00:39:00,788
guidance tooling process testing as

767
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:06,999
appropriate to make it work at that

768
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:10,660
scale speed I talked about about the the

769
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:13,538
online service people and and adapting

770
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,549
you know how do you do it how do you do

771
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,650
it for agile or DevOps well the key

772
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:20,140
thing is to integrate into the developer

773
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:25,719
workflow if you can do that you win or

774
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:27,339
you win enough and supply chain that's

775
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:30,279
you know that's sort of government ease

776
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:33,339
for using somebody else's code when we

777
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:37,420
started we mostly wrote everything we

778
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:40,109
shipped today everybody does third-party

779
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,320
code especially but not exclusively

780
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:45,750
open-source and so you know

781
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,810
you have to have to have a standard for

782
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:51,780
acceptance of what open-source you'll

783
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:56,180
use you have to have maybe you have to

784
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:58,470
have and and in internal in an initial

785
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,210
quality assessment or review to make

786
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,580
sure you're not going to do something to

787
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,290
yourself when you adopt some code you

788
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,940
got it if you're relying on a third

789
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,770
party you got to know what that is

790
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,630
you've got to know who's responsible for

791
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,640
it whether it's you or the third party

792
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,590
and you've got to be prepared to respond

793
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,660
when vulnerabilities are discovered and

794
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,220
ideally you've got to be able to

795
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,319
continuously improve it or know that

796
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:25,290
somebody else will continuously improve

797
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:27,720
it so summary it works because the

798
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:33,210
developers are writing the secure

799
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:36,569
software we're not compliance ngey in I

800
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:42,900
told you you know 60 in the SDL theme

801
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:45,870
40,000 developers you can't test after

802
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,230
the fact and get to security at that

803
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:51,210
kind of a developer population you know

804
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,550
I just just think about it how many

805
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:57,060
people would it take reviewing the work

806
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:59,070
of 40,000 developers so you know you get

807
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:03,630
the developers to write secure software

808
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:07,290
and the product teams have to buy in to

809
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:09,660
to do that and part of that you know is

810
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,029
is understanding what bad can happen

811
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,609
part of that is is watching other

812
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,950
people's stories for us I mean you know

813
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,290
code read nimda weren't fun but they

814
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,319
were instrumental in making the changes

815
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:26,720
we made and the security team becomes

816
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,760
advisors facility facilitators experts

817
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,770
not-not-not inspectors or testers and

818
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,820
and it's small compared to the

819
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:38,640
population so that's you know sort of 20

820
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,610
years or 30 years of history in in about

821
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,879
45 minutes which was pretty much my

822
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:49,830
target people people have questions or

823
00:41:44,880 --> 00:42:02,970
pushback or or feedback I'm here until

824
00:41:49,830 --> 00:42:04,560
Alex pulls of the trapdoor questions so

825
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,600
yes so if you have a question please

826
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,070
come up to the mic if you would like to

827
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:14,730
give a talk please submit to the CFP

828
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:16,290
though thanks that was a great talk I'm

829
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,810
curious one of the things you mentioned

830
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,509
was well have many questions but there's

831
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:24,150
no one behind me so nobody behind you so

832
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,550
when the people write secure software

833
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,830
out of pride a lot of software is

834
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,780
developed by outsourcing or contractors

835
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,690
or to like come in hack something in

836
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,890
build there's a pride for company it

837
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,180
does the pride for the product cause

838
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,120
you're going to do something new next

839
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,879
month still be there and then how do you

840
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,620
secure in that context and the other

841
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,940
thing is like you know do you mention

842
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,799
supply chain but another thing that's

843
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,070
happening right now a lot is cloud

844
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,020
software you know Salesforce marketing

845
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,210
campaigns and all that a lot of the

846
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,800
users are not developers but there is

847
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,690
still a lot of technical like

848
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,240
configuration and like most a lot of

849
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,980
breeches nowadays happen due to

850
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,479
configuration errors in like keeping s3

851
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,630
buckets open who would do that but

852
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,240
people do and so in that context how do

853
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,550
you think advice for people configuring

854
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,580
these complex systems could apply some

855
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:16,890
lessons from here okay so so so two

856
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,779
questions one of them is you know

857
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,359
contractor contractors transient

858
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:26,370
transient employees what have you our

859
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:32,910
experience you know was that we we we

860
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:34,859
used relatively few contract employees I

861
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,799
mean people you know people you know we

862
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:40,170
had very various kind of kinds of folks

863
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,240
on staff but in general people were long

864
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,180
lived in the environment and they were

865
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,399
expected you know to follow the rules to

866
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:50,009
do the SPL that was part of what they

867
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,360
were what was in the development

868
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,360
environment that was part of what they

869
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,820
were hired to do if you if you

870
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:01,110
contracted with somebody for a

871
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,580
deliverable a thing you know that we we

872
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,430
did some of where

873
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,970
you know basically include SDL terms in

874
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:12,629
the in the contract you know that that

875
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:15,089
puts puts a stress on on being able to

876
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:17,640
select a contractor that you trust to do

877
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:21,150
that but but that's part of part of the

878
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,640
requirements set the second question you

879
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:28,950
know about about cloud services and

880
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:31,529
configuration so two things one your

881
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:33,750
your cloud service provider ought to be

882
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,910
doing secure development and you ought

883
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,130
to you know figure out whether they are

884
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,500
or not if they're not maybe find another

885
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:44,100
cloud service provider and then the

886
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,280
other thing I mean in terms of

887
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:50,520
configuration and locking down I mean

888
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,700
you know the SDL lessons apply as well

889
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,730
to operations and we actually built a

890
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,980
companion process called OSA operations

891
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,260
security assurance but you know the

892
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,260
basics are you know what are the

893
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,970
requirements how can you build you know

894
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,820
how can you build tooling to confirm

895
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:11,459
that those requirements have met how can

896
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,890
you do continuous improvement to make

897
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:17,250
sure that that things are that that

898
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:19,290
things are being being updated as needed

899
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,350
based on on new threats and new

900
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:26,009
incidents but you know but the lessons

901
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:28,920
are still there although you know

902
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,510
although that although it's a little

903
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,130
it's a little different because you're

904
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,020
not you know sort of doing a build and

905
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,700
release it's sort of continuous but

906
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,040
maybe you're doing continuous scanning

907
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:41,160
to ensure that that the things you

908
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,560
expect your configuration to be still

909
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,330
are that so you know so that was

910
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,860
something and we actually had pretty

911
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:52,920
good luck with with the OSA experience

912
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:54,540
it's one quick did you sue anyone for

913
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,830
not following the STL when you had it in

914
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,630
the terms side again

915
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,009
did someone you like you said you put it

916
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,050
in the legal terms that like you must

917
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:04,050
follow as deal and did you ever sue and

918
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:07,290
get back the money or like you know no I

919
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:10,710
I mean you mean you mean for third party

920
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:13,320
for four for a third party or contract

921
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,609
code not following this deal no I mean I

922
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,259
mean

923
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:17,989
you you know you basically provide

924
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:21,589
feedback and say you know do it really

925
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:23,210
do it I think there was like a Simpsons

926
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:28,730
episode where Microsoft lawyers come to

927
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:31,099
provide feedback to home I Dave Wagner

928
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,859
from Berkeley a great talk thank you so

929
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:35,349
I'm wondering about how you would

930
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:39,680
suggest we think about a situation where

931
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:41,359
like you ship product 1.0 version 1.0 of

932
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,210
the product that was built to the STL at

933
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,950
the time and then discover new thread

934
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,829
and the STL gets updated with some new

935
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:51,470
coding rule and now it's time to build

936
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:52,940
like 1.1 or 2.0 or the product so you've

937
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,649
got some existing code and then you're

938
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,400
writing some new code and you could

939
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:00,529
imagine saying oh go back and sweep

940
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,749
through all the existing code to now

941
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,670
comply with the new coding rule to deal

942
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:06,049
with that threat which would maybe be

943
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,480
the safer thing but on the other hand

944
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:10,788
puts a lot of friction in sort of

945
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,130
upgrades and so just wondering if you

946
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:17,390
had any experience about how to think

947
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:20,690
about dealing with that trade-off so so

948
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:24,519
one of the things so so if you look at

949
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:27,950
now I think STL something like 5.2 is

950
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:34,029
downloadable on the web and and I think

951
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:36,230
it probably includes language that

952
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:40,369
distinguishes between new code and all

953
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:43,519
code okay and an all code you know when

954
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:46,809
it when it says all code you know you

955
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:52,089
you run you run on everything and fix it

956
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:54,230
so we did we did in fact understand that

957
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:57,078
acknowledged that in terms of how we

958
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:59,410
decided between all a new you know that

959
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:02,299
was you know basically a risk based

960
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:04,129
judgment and if you again if you look on

961
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:09,140
the web there's actually something

962
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:13,130
called the SDL bug bar that that gives

963
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:15,348
you at least a sketch of how we thought

964
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:18,680
about the severity of the problems that

965
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:21,670
we were dealing with or responding to so

966
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:25,549
you know so those were those were things

967
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,640
that that we did think about you know we

968
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:28,589
understand

969
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,558
you know one I mean it's always a

970
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:33,239
balancing act the reason you know I

971
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,549
didn't have this and didn't get this

972
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:39,269
into the end of the talk you know part

973
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:42,390
of the reason we didn't include XP in

974
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:44,459
the original security push the 2002

975
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:48,960
security push because it was out there

976
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,670
and so you know the the product product

977
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,249
executives said you know if we if we

978
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,980
make this level of change to a shipping

979
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:58,558
product in a service pack customers

980
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,720
won't install the service pack and so

981
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,119
you know that there are other things too

982
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:08,098
like we had had a deadline for antitrust

983
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:09,809
but but if but but but those are the

984
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:16,410
sort of config considerations that

985
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:20,390
you're balancing thank you thank you hey

986
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:23,038
Steve we talked this is from Amazon so

987
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:25,109
with new concepts coming like lean

988
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,539
startup and feel fast

989
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:29,640
developers usually want to like ship

990
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:31,650
features fast and they promise to either

991
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:35,460
like public or leadership like we want

992
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:38,190
to do this and if this their promises

993
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,920
conflict with SDL or if that as deal

994
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,809
timeline increases whatever they plan to

995
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,579
deliver on how do you deal with the

996
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:46,200
trade-off they're like yeah we want to

997
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:50,900
deliver this and if we do this it will

998
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:55,019
consume more time so so so the key thing

999
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:59,160
the the key thing you know that that

1000
00:49:55,019 --> 00:50:04,038
that I think worked for for us was being

1001
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:07,859
able to integrate the tooling into into

1002
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:10,289
the the developer workflow okay that

1003
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,779
that was that was super important and

1004
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:19,319
actually you know being able to meet the

1005
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:22,200
needs of being being msn msn hotmail you

1006
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:24,450
know and and you know it's a continue

1007
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:33,269
can continues to be an important

1008
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:37,060
consideration if if if you if you I mean

1009
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:40,689
I I remember I remember talking to

1010
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:46,990
to a company that was trying to do in

1011
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:49,600
SDL and their model had had become you

1012
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:52,540
know build the software run the static

1013
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:55,810
analysis at the end give the static

1014
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:58,180
analysis bugs back to the you know to

1015
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,610
the developers and then tell them to fix

1016
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,589
them you know and this was you know the

1017
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,480
the the company in question actually

1018
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:07,060
using a static analysis tool where you

1019
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,700
could run it on the desktop and so I

1020
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,500
told them run it on the desktop given

1021
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,899
the given the developers the feedback

1022
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,000
immediately and just you know when they

1023
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:19,420
when they built code it's secure code or

1024
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,940
closer but you know you you have to have

1025
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,830
that mindset of integrating security

1026
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,330
into the development and that you know I

1027
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,759
don't guarantee that that will solve

1028
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:29,860
every problem but it will it will go a

1029
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,860
long way toward getting you shipping

1030
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:39,880
secure code rather than to keep shipping

1031
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:42,160
security patches hey thanks for the

1032
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,760
great talk I'm because I'm live from the

1033
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,980
MPI for software systems and yeah like

1034
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,050
you know that like Microsoft is also

1035
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,360
involved with projects like F star and

1036
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,130
which do like more verification I would

1037
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,680
be interest in general what are your

1038
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,870
thoughts on like formal methods and like

1039
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:04,450
form of verification of code to ensure

1040
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:07,299
security so so I mean so you know back

1041
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,009
back to Alex's introduction I mean you

1042
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,380
know one of the things I did in my

1043
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:14,980
misspent youth was to lead a project

1044
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:19,540
building an a.1 system under the orange

1045
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:23,560
book and so I'm sure that my experience

1046
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:27,550
with formal verification is not up to

1047
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:30,250
the standards of today if you can if you

1048
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,900
if you can do that and you can get it

1049
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:37,180
integrated into the developer

1050
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:40,900
environment I love it

1051
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:43,390
if you know our our experience back in

1052
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,220
the a1 System days you know was very

1053
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:48,220
much like the model I said we don't use

1054
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,629
for SDL you know we had the verifiers as

1055
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,950
a separate team they were doing for

1056
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,900
you know they were doing specs they were

1057
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:57,020
doing formal verification and we have

1058
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,480
these big meetings to map the you know

1059
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:02,060
map the the code and the designs to the

1060
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:05,600
formal versions of the code and designs

1061
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:09,140
and so you know that especially today

1062
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,410
you know the previous question about you

1063
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:14,270
know about about you know rapid rapid

1064
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,410
development rapid deployment I mean

1065
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:18,170
you've got it you've got to make that

1066
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,750
trade-off I like I like you know I'm a

1067
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:23,120
believer in formal formal methods I you

1068
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,800
know I read the hakam's papers and you

1069
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,950
know I think that's really cool stuff

1070
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,960
but you've got a it's got to be

1071
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:33,350
consumable by the developers who are

1072
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,650
doing the scope of the product you're

1073
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:40,970
developing and it's got to be possible

1074
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:45,020
to ship in time and so you know it's I'd

1075
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:47,839
say aspirational so yes so do you know

1076
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:50,509
like any technologies which are already

1077
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,520
usable by like normal developers or like

1078
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:58,250
does Microsoft cues some things there

1079
00:53:52,520 --> 00:54:02,000
are like the main you know the two main

1080
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:04,460
stream payoffs I'm not sure as a cheater

1081
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,140
on a non-answer or not the two main

1082
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,270
stream payoffs you know there's a lot of

1083
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:12,379
formal methods that have made their way

1084
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:16,460
into the static analysis and fuzzing and

1085
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:19,370
and Microsoft makes huge use of both of

1086
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,230
those and then the other thing is to the

1087
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,850
extent that you can get to manage code

1088
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:25,850
I'm not sure that's route and I think

1089
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:27,799
that's really a formal formal methods

1090
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:29,420
answer but getting to manage code and

1091
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,310
getting away from the memory errors

1092
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:38,930
is super important if you can do it

1093
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:43,250
thank you all right okay no more

1094
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:44,419
questions no more questions okay thank

1095
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:47,050
you one more time thank you thank you

1096
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,050
thank you all

1097
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:50,109
you
