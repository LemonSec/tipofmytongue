1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,510
everyone like Brett said I will be

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,330
presenting you how to prevent

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:23,790
enlargement attack on ranging systems

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:28,080
like ranging system is like well studied

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,180
and people are working on it and there

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,519
are a lot of already use cases and the

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,790
use cases are increasing rapidly for

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,470
example access control is a tracking

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,180
localization robotics all these

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:44,760
application need ranging in some sense

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,950
the way forward for the localization for

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,879
these application for secure ranging is

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,020
ultra wideband and standardization and

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,190
commercialization efforts are going on

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,250
like lot of people and a lot of money is

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,129
getting invested in this kind of ranging

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,269
systems to build these systems to design

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:08,250
techniques how to secure these systems

19
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,439
however there days there are still

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,170
possibilities then that an external

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,408
attacker can prove that the distance

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,859
measured is measured correct incorrectly

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,829
because of the presence of an attacker

24
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:25,469
so what are these issues what can an

25
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,889
attacker do in this scenario so we look

26
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:32,339
at two possibilities either a token can

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,829
prove that two devices are close to each

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,299
other when they are actually far from

29
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,309
each other like in PK es system where

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,079
the key is inside the house card is

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,770
parked outside but attacker can prove

32
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,990
that the key is near to the car or there

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,210
can be distance enlargement attack where

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,609
the devices are very close to each other

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,669
but attacker prove that these two

36
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:59,729
devices are far from each other this can

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,819
lead to like may possibly collision like

38
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,729
if two vehicles are going one after and

39
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,439
another and babies are wrong distance

40
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,160
between them they might have speed up

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,560
and collide or babies are the wrong

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,190
position of themselves and like a star

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,930
taking a wrong path until now the

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,440
community has mainly worked on

45
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,230
preventing reduction attacks

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,410
however this not enough work done on a

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,349
large mint attacks like we don't want

48
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:36,359
systems to collide or follow a path

49
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:39,870
which is designed by attacker so how are

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,590
these system exist look like in that

51
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,510
look like today so to prevent distance

52
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,900
reduction attack we have we use

53
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,000
challenge response protocol we are these

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,880
challenge and responses are generated

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,370
cryptographically so to manipulate the

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,930
distance the reduction iraq for the

57
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,450
reduction and reduction attack attacker

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,190
ha will need to predict these challenge

59
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,440
and responses given that these are

60
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,720
cryptographically generated attacker

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,880
cannot predict them in advance so he

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,790
cannot perform distance reduction attack

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,700
however that is not entirely true for

64
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,620
that enlargement attack because this

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,140
signal is already being generated this

66
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,819
packet has already beats sent and then

67
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,319
attacker is trying to do that so

68
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,899
attacker doesn't have to break any

69
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,619
cryptography at the present moment so

70
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,109
attacker can just cancel this signal or

71
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,600
he will just replay the signal with

72
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,820
higher power later in time and create an

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,358
effect at the receiver that it calculate

74
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,720
time of flight on the attacker signal

75
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:44,940
and not on the legitimate signal so we

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,829
need something we need a kind of

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,859
challenge response protocol which is

78
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:53,130
secured against an enlargement attack so

79
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,410
mean we need to design secure challenge

80
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,690
responses to prevent enlargement at the

81
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,239
exit so that the time of flight

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,010
estimation is done on the signal

83
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,750
transmitted by the legitimate

84
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:11,910
transmitter and not on by the attacker

85
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:13,230
so this so over here like we already

86
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,090
know that we have to design these

87
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,769
challenge response to protocol now I

88
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,048
will go more into the detail of

89
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,570
ultra-wideband like how the physical

90
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,000
layer of ultra-wideband looks like how

91
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,750
the attack is performed and what are the

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,840
ways in which we can prevent enlargement

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,770
attack so physical layer of

94
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,060
ultra-wideband

95
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,000
can be modulated by using

96
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,010
on of King modulation over here the

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,960
presence of pulse is initial part of the

98
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,150
symbol represent bit one and the

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,960
presence of pulses in the later part of

100
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,239
symbol represent bit zero so when these

101
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,700
sings in signal reach reaches at the

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,460
receiver the receiver aggregate energy

103
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,170
of these pulses so if the initial pulses

104
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,010
have higher energy as compared to the

105
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,420
later pulses this is detected as bit one

106
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:05,560
otherwise it is protected detectors as

107
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,840
bit zero so how will an attacker perform

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,830
enlargement attack on these kind of bits

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,400
so here we have two bits bit one and bit

110
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:20,140
0 I think it's wrong and then attacker

111
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,330
can simply relate this signal after time

112
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,909
Delta and given that this signal

113
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,419
attacker is relaying with higher power

114
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,940
it might it might be possible that the

115
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,490
receiver lock on to the attacker signal

116
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,120
and calculated the time of flight using

117
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:40,030
this signal or there can even see where

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,370
attack we our attacker first try to any

119
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,369
lead the legitimate signal and then

120
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,790
replay the signal so even if an attacker

121
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,850
do something smart it still has to look

122
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:57,190
whether there was a legitimate copy of

123
00:05:51,850 --> 00:06:00,010
this signal or not or this can be just

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,140
released delay attack where two devices

125
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,950
are not in the communication range or

126
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:08,530
the signal is being blocked by wall or

127
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,650
something and the receiver is receiving

128
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,919
only the copy of signal which is

129
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,219
generated by a tiger out of all these

130
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,880
anneal aid and replay is most severe

131
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,330
kind of attack because attacker tries to

132
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,030
any lead the legitimate signal and send

133
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,130
the copy of signal later in time so if

134
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,200
even if a receiver perform back search

135
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,990
over this signal he will not find

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,729
anything because it is just not

137
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:43,900
available on the channel so we can say

138
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:47,140
that just generating secure

139
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,650
cryptographic data at the high level is

140
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,020
not

141
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,150
enough to prevent a large mint attack we

142
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,370
need to perform attack at the fishing we

143
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,539
need to perform checks at the physical

144
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:01,360
layer so first of all we have to be we

145
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:04,479
have to limit that we can only achieve

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,190
secure systems which are which are

147
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,289
secured against distance enlargement

148
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,810
attack if these two device are in

149
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:13,509
communication range so if legitimate

150
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,789
signal is not getting received at the

151
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:20,889
receiver there's no way of detecting

152
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:23,469
this signal so let so this is our first

153
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,060
assumption that these two device are

154
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,220
within the communication range and if

155
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,380
they are able they are in communication

156
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,419
range they are they are able to

157
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,449
communicate with each other and this

158
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:36,219
signal is getting received at the

159
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:41,050
receiver and now attacker have to

160
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:42,760
prevent this reception so like if the

161
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,250
signal was generated by just on-off

162
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,770
keying modulation it wasn't enough so

163
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,560
how do we generate these code which can

164
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,830
which can be used to prevent distance

165
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,940
enlargement attack so here we show our

166
00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:00,219
code structure here we have alpha pulses

167
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:03,610
there are beta positions where we don't

168
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,889
have pulses this can be considered as an

169
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,630
on-off keying modulation scheme because

170
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,400
over there also we have some positions

171
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,430
which have pulses and which doesn't have

172
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,880
courses but before transmitting this

173
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:20,039
signal we randomly change their polarity

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,870
and after changing their polarity we

175
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,909
reorder these pulses so changing

176
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,979
polarity is not a problem for our

177
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,349
receiver because of a receiver as we

178
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,599
have seen earlier it is a energy

179
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,400
detector receiver and energy detector

180
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,330
receiver just accumulate energy it does

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,919
not care about the phase of these pulses

182
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:44,709
and these pulses are separated by time

183
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:48,220
TS and this is more than the round-trip

184
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:52,270
time of this the signal for a maximum

185
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,240
communication range so what's the

186
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:58,860
difference between when we are sending

187
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,180
this signal and what we are receiving so

188
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,720
signal is degraded

189
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,750
transmission there will be some noise

190
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,600
there will be the attacker will be

191
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,350
trying to distort the signal by used by

192
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,030
sending a cancellation signal and

193
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,770
attacker will certainly D play this

194
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:22,720
signal to affect time of flight

195
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:25,060
estimation now when the signal will

196
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,210
reach at the receiver it will start

197
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:31,209
searching for this code or signal we are

198
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,490
sending most probably it will lock on to

199
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,400
the legend or lock on to the attacker

200
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:41,890
signal because it has higher power but

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:43,810
if it search back it might find copy of

202
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,300
the legitimate signal which has been

203
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:50,680
distorted by the attacker or it might

204
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:54,640
lock on to the noise so whatever we do

205
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,400
at the receiver we should not discard

206
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:02,530
authentic signal as the noise or noise

207
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:07,150
should not be detected as an attack so

208
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:12,189
this is what we do at the receiver so I

209
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:15,400
will not go into this complex way of

210
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,830
doing it just look at the take away we

211
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,260
have here the total energy we are

212
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:23,380
receiving should be less than certain

213
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:28,330
threshold and this signal should not be

214
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:30,970
similar to expected code and that then

215
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,160
only attacker can win because if

216
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,060
attacker and I add too much energy into

217
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,709
the channel we are saying that this

218
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,640
signal will be used for time of rival

219
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,590
estimation and if that signal is similar

220
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:51,640
to the code then we will obviously use

221
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:54,660
it for time of flight estimation the

222
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,970
code structure we have designed here

223
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:02,199
sort of prevent attacker to achieve

224
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,570
these two objects why because of the

225
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,410
random polarity polarity and random

226
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:10,660
position so if a tiger guesses the

227
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,790
polarity of the pulse incorrectly

228
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,860
instead of annihilating the signal in

229
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,569
of canceling this signal the attacker

230
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,550
will increase energy of the signal if

231
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,400
attacker does not get position of the

232
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:30,050
symbol correctly he will add energy into

233
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:32,689
this signal so the let's see what will

234
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,880
attack I do we have our signal after

235
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,030
degrade degradation let's see this

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,920
further signal we were expecting what I

237
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:45,530
can try to send signal with same energy

238
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,949
but he does not know the phase of these

239
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:50,480
pulses he doesn't know not know the

240
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,770
position of these pulses he will just

241
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,700
randomly send them at some places

242
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:00,470
why why why does a attacker does not

243
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,900
know the phase of these pulses because

244
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:07,370
these pulses are very very narrow and

245
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:12,949
this is hard for existing receivers or

246
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,990
if the or if the attacker is out of line

247
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,090
of line of sight of these devices to

248
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,570
know what exactly the phase of these

249
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:22,250
pulses is so it is hard for a tiger to

250
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,170
know the phase that it is hard for that

251
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,300
Uyghur to know the position so typer

252
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:31,520
will just randomly send pulses at

253
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:35,300
certain positions if attacker is lucky

254
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:39,650
he he might succeed in canceling some of

255
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:42,920
these pulses otherwise he will either

256
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:45,290
amplify the existing pulses or add

257
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,099
energy at the positions where energy was

258
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:53,500
not expected and given that attitude is

259
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:56,870
increasing the energy increased further

260
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,630
so this was a were authentic signal this

261
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,460
was supposed to be received like there

262
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,500
there there will be some positions which

263
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,500
have energy there will be another

264
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,250
petitions which does not have energy and

265
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,040
this is how our code should look like

266
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,950
but in seed after attack a tiger try to

267
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,959
and he laid this signal instead of

268
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,840
annihilating this signal attacker have

269
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,850
added energy at the positions like even

270
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,880
more energy at the positions where

271
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,650
energy was present he also has added

272
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,410
energy at somebody

273
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,449
where energy was not present but still

274
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:38,140
the code structure look very similar to

275
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:42,380
what was expected so we we can say that

276
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:45,290
it is hard for attacker to to achieve

277
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,660
this goal of not increasing the energy

278
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:54,829
of energy too much and is still changing

279
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:57,319
the code structure to analyze this we we

280
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:02,270
perform we use a probabilistic model as

281
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,830
well as performed simulations so let's

282
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,290
look at the probability program

283
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,660
probability model so over here we know

284
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,540
that there are two objective attacker

285
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,800
has to achieve like like total energy of

286
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,550
the signal should be less than certain

287
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,770
threshold and the similarity of the code

288
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:22,099
through the received signal should be

289
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,020
less then only attacker can succeed the

290
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,840
probability of attacker sucks is depend

291
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:30,920
on different factors here like code

292
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:37,370
structure how many pulses are sent how

293
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:40,099
many positions are there which doesn't

294
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:45,310
have pulses so what is the formation of

295
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:47,570
Alpha and Beta then there is a

296
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:51,260
aggregation function which decide on

297
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:55,550
like how many pulses of each bin beta

298
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,650
and bin alpha are taken to compare the

299
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,380
signal so basically this is used to

300
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:03,110
detect the similarity between these two

301
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,260
codes let the receiver the received one

302
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,450
and the expected one and the number of

303
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:14,210
pulses transmitted by the attacker and

304
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:19,460
the channel condition so over here we

305
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:22,430
see that on the x axis we have the

306
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,620
number of pulses generated by attacker

307
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,620
and on the right axis we have the

308
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,710
probability of a tiger success and over

309
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,280
there in the Zeta for for the two

310
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:38,840
different lines it basically shows like

311
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:40,040
how much far like how much degradation

312
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,970
of our actual

313
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,329
happened so how much far our actual

314
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,550
signal is from the threshold so I'd ever

315
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:54,319
have that much amount of energy he can

316
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:57,170
add into the channel so over so by using

317
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,190
the number of adversary pulses on the

318
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,459
x-axis we show that if attacker keep

319
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:08,540
adding energy on the signal then he

320
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:11,750
wallet first condition otherwise he does

321
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,180
not succeed in the second condition so

322
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,240
he cannot achieve these two goals

323
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,969
simultaneously so to achieve the second

324
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,310
goal he has to violate first goal and to

325
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:26,420
achieve the first goal he does not

326
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:29,209
succeed in achieving the second goal so

327
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:34,370
over here we show that these two goals

328
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:39,709
cannot be achieved simultaneously we

329
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,690
also to simulate the to get the feel of

330
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,339
like how the system will work on the

331
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,579
real environment where the noise is

332
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,370
present and they might be interference

333
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:52,010
we simulated it using the channel model

334
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,680
which are provided by I Triple E and we

335
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,930
show that this system work at different

336
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,750
distances and the probability of

337
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,849
attacker success is same as the one the

338
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,530
one we have calculated in using

339
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:09,669
probabilistic model we show that

340
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:13,549
distance a large meant is a big problem

341
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:16,280
we need we have we needed our scheme to

342
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:18,290
prevent those attacks you vbe D is the

343
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,020
first scheme that prevent distance

344
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,020
enlargement attack thank you

345
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:41,120
questions for a speaker so what question

346
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:44,570
I had from from your talk is you've done

347
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,799
a lot of experiments to show but this

348
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,720
provides the security guarantees that

349
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,330
you're looking for one of the things I

350
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,100
noticed though is that you are moving

351
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,740
the pulses around in time and I was

352
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,139
wondering if that might have an effect

353
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,309
on the function of the applications that

354
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:06,409
this is going to be used for

355
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:09,980
oh you mean over here right yeah yep

356
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:12,740
yeah so like it will not have any effect

357
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,270
on like system performance like where

358
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,010
the pulses are present because the

359
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,260
transmitter and receiver share this

360
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,850
information like where the pulses will

361
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,330
be present and where the pulses will not

362
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,908
represent so like receiver can compare

363
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,030
like whether the X the received signal

364
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,950
is similar to the expected one or not

365
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,480
sure I just meant if it was gonna take

366
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:37,760
longer to get a range finding for

367
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:41,240
example yes yes so if you have to add a

368
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,379
lot of free spaces then for sure it will

369
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,100
take longer time to do the ranging one

370
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,860
more question so for the distance

371
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,949
largeman attack you you said that the

372
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:59,360
the attacker would have some hard time

373
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,640
locating the the the pulses or you know

374
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,520
determining the the phase of those

375
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,190
pulses and so it's not completely clear

376
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,080
why is that the case especially about

377
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,270
this in in this type of attacks the you

378
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,370
know it's not like a real time attack

379
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,070
let's say because the the attacker has

380
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:24,439
some time to you know process the signal

381
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:29,899
and try to analyze it exactly yeah sure

382
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:32,230
so over here like so over here we said

383
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,730
that okay we will have like a signal

384
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,340
which have like some pulses at some

385
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,110
positions and and not at another

386
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,360
positions so

387
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,699
attacker doesn't know where these pulses

388
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,120
are present and these pulses are very

389
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,519
very narrow so like two nanoseconds so

390
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,158
attacker will have hard time in

391
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:57,140
detecting the phase of these pulses and

392
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,929
yeah and and even the buzzes present or

393
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,549
not and attack for the two nano second

394
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,200
attacker has to be really in the

395
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,899
communication range of these two devices

396
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,490
so he has to really sit on the antenna

397
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,799
of one of these devices to do this

398
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,710
attack otherwise he cannot detect that

399
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:15,830
and and the benefit of doing this is

400
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,039
that attacker need to know the phase of

401
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,830
these pulses to achieve cancellation but

402
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,899
receiver doesn't care about the fields

403
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,678
of these pulses because the receiver

404
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:32,768
just take energy of these pulses and

405
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:35,360
then aggregate it these signals you know

406
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:37,639
part of an error correction code or

407
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,549
something or are they just randomly

408
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:45,439
generated signals because if it's you

409
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:47,480
know part of a yeah codebook and the

410
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,429
attacker would have more information on

411
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,809
where the policy should be yeah exactly

412
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:54,919
that's why we say that we use this

413
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,809
reordering so this is a kind of a

414
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,389
pseudo-random reordering you can say and

415
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:01,309
the transmitter and receiver share this

416
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:03,678
information but this is not generated

417
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:05,480
using any code book because attacker can

418
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,490
also have access to that code book and

419
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,050
we don't want that thank you let's thank

420
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:17,349
our speaker one last time

421
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,349
[Applause]
