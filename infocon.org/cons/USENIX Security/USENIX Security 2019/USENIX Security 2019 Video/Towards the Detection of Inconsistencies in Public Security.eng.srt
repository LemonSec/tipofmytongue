00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:17,240
hello my name is ESU teacher gonca me

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,900
Lewis so happy to be here to talk about

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,049
the inconsistency security vulnerability

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,709
reports let's say the joint work with my

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:31,310
collaborators from UCAS Penn State UIUC

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,680
and Jerry calm suppose you are a

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,780
security operations engineer your

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,480
everyday work is to keep an eye of all

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,360
kinds of vulnerability report websites

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,000
to see if any software used in your

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,100
company a body in this way you can pass

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,890
them in time to lower security risks

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,750
among these websites you may frequently

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,719
check and read e national vulnerability

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,039
database maintained by US government it

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,230
includes security rated a software flaws

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,129
product an MS impact metrics and many

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:06,800
other information CBE is another

19
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,620
important source it is industry standard

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,140
for vulnerability exposure it assigns

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,170
each vulnerability a severe unit ID

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,450
called savvy number except these two

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,510
websites you can also find other pieces

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,820
of reports from websites like exploit

25
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,740
the database security focus rather

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,110
helped back izella or park bounty

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,229
programs from companies like Apple

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,850
Microsoft and Google all these websites

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,740
use save in DUMBO to refer venerability

30
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:40,970
one day you will notice that a new park

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,820
with severe number 2018 0 8 5 2 is

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,160
reported this park is in Microsoft

33
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,500
Outlook the email box used in your

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,929
company it's time to do something right

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,840
then you quickly go through the motions

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,980
listed in video report and surprisingly

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,950
find the devotion used in your company

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,530
2007 ESPY 3 is not listed as a

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,660
responsible security operations engineer

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,929
of course you will find another report

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,660
for double checking then you'll find one

42
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,940
from CBE this time you find that a

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,609
devotion used in your company is clearly

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,800
listed MVD and a CVE

45
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,990
are actually turning inconsistent

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,280
information which want you to trust

47
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:27,500
quite a confusing right

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,980
okay you may ask is such inconsistency

49
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,090
prevalent or it's only a color case you

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,849
may also wonder what are the

51
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,510
characteristics of inconsistent

52
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,179
information

53
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,799
what causes inconsistency and what are

54
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,319
the security implications of

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,459
inconsistency to answer these questions

56
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,500
we need a measurement in this people we

57
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,590
do this measurement of vulnerability

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:56,239
reports that first of all archived over

59
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:59,480
decades from 1999 to 2018 and secondly

60
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,630
across various websites including CVE

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,660
open war exploited database security

62
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,420
focus and many others more importantly

63
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,109
our measurement is not limited to one

64
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,149
specific category instead we include 13

65
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,849
different categories that are listed by

66
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,760
led this is a very large-scale

67
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:23,209
measurement it's almost impossible to

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,780
complete this task manually therefore we

69
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,970
design deem an automatic system that can

70
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,180
extract Venerable software names and

71
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,549
devotions from unstructured reports our

72
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,519
describes the design of Veen as the

73
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,180
first part of my talk as a second part

74
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,910
of my talk

75
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,910
our explain how we use extracted and

76
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,040
names and emotions to quantify

77
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,350
inconsistency more importantly I will

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,660
show some interesting findings through

79
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,260
our large-scale measurement let's get

80
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,170
started to quantify inconsistency

81
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,760
information we want to identify

82
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,250
vulnerable software names and emotions

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,920
from unstructured reports written by

84
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,739
human beings traditional NLP tools

85
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,720
however don't work in our context the

86
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,230
main reason is the uniqueness of

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,049
variability reports for example this

88
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,298
report says some versions of Ruby on

89
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,358
Rails are vulnerable where others are

90
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:23,299
not Ruby on Rails different from simply

91
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,299
Ruby is a newly introduced software at

92
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,639
at that time since we've never seen this

93
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,880
software before a dictionary based

94
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,099
method Affairs decides in the report

95
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,140
both venerable and the non vulnerable

96
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,370
versions are listed we can hardly

97
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,550
predefined

98
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,550
to distinguish them know each other this

99
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,950
requires contacts in ative analysis

100
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,170
third as you can see this report is a

101
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,659
highly unstructured because it is

102
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,490
written by human regular expression

103
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,970
doesn't have that capability to

104
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,840
understand a natural language this is a

105
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,560
NASA reported sample in Windows Vista

106
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,419
sp2 and the Windows Server 2008 sp2 so

107
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,780
windows default library in dotnet

108
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,030
framework so many entities we can use

109
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,390
techniques that I can only handle single

110
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,419
entity another program is vulnerability

111
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,849
types are diverse in this sample we have

112
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,970
memory corruption in the last example we

113
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,640
have an injection therefore we can use

114
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,460
tools designed for one certain type to

115
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,039
solve all different times actually we

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,560
tried one of such kind of tools and find

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,280
that is recall is smaller than 40

118
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,700
percent based on above observation

119
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,000
represent vim vim consists of two

120
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,570
components the first apart is an ER IE

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,160
modo we use this model to identify

122
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,670
venerable software names and motions

123
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,820
have displaced on the slides the input

124
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,240
of any RI modal is sentences in the

125
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,790
report we first imported to the any our

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,400
model an ER model will output or

127
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,310
software names and motions in sentences

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,909
don't matter venerable on non venerable

129
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,940
ones in this example Microsoft VB script

130
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,490
and Internet Explorer are names five

131
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,430
point seven and five point eight nine

132
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,500
through eleven erosions inside the model

133
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,930
we use recurrent in that for

134
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,540
identification water character embedding

135
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,090
for pre-processing and a gazetteer to

136
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,560
further improve accuracy we don't have

137
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:35,030
time for them but you can find more

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,100
details from our paper after that

139
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,989
identifying games and emotions which

140
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,890
shuffle and combine them each by each

141
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,330
and feed them to re modo for Perry the

142
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,729
output of our Emoto

143
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,300
is final results the venerable software

144
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,139
names and emotions inside re modo we use

145
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,810
one hot

146
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,199
coding to present possible nan Roshan

147
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,629
Perry then we input this encoding to a

148
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,150
hierarchical attention network to

149
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,159
predict which pairing is most likely to

150
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,229
capture the relationship between

151
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:10,550
software names and it's corresponding

152
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:12,590
versions which ring are an ER a model

153
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,439
for memory corruption to capture its

154
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,779
specific characteristics then we use

155
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,819
transfer learning to train models for

156
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,669
other categories for example sequel

157
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,800
injection they do not out in shortens

158
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,889
training cycle but also overcomes

159
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,830
inadequate training data of some

160
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:33,099
vulnerability categories to evaluate

161
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,080
Veen we exhaustively collect more than

162
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:38,900
70,000 vulnerability reports over path

163
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,090
to 20 years part of the reports are

164
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,638
structured from security trackers and

165
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,128
security focus the remaining are

166
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,069
unstructured reports from exploited

167
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:53,270
database open war and security focus

168
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:56,439
forum we manual labeled almost 2,000

169
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,659
reports at the ground truth for training

170
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,580
we first train and ER IE modal for

171
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:05,719
memory corruption in our ground truth

172
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,990
data set we have over 3,000 cv IDs which

173
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:11,899
train the modal with racial h-11 for

174
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,599
training validation and testing clearly

175
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:17,779
see from the table that ng r a modal

176
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:20,719
performs will and we are turn near 100%

177
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:24,379
accuracy the state-of-the-art is no

178
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:26,599
higher than 90% we also evaluate the

179
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,699
transfer learning we use memory

180
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,460
corruption as teacher modal and other

181
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:35,269
categories as student motives for each

182
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,279
student a modal we have 145 reports at

183
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:40,219
the ground truth data set and divide

184
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,979
them with a ratio 1:1 for pre training

185
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,199
and a testing as we can see from the

186
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,110
table transfer learning largely

187
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:50,479
increased accuracy and does help solve

188
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,750
Incans in Erik when the data proven in

189
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,519
some categories our paper is too much

190
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,360
more detail results and you can find

191
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,209
them here after extracting vulnerable

192
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,220
software names and emotions using vim we

193
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,739
do large scale measurement

194
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,140
we're falsifying our metrics of

195
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,690
consistency you have to software and

196
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,510
dams show more common words we consider

197
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,460
them as the same one here Internet

198
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,520
Explorer and the Microsoft Internet

199
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:22,540
Explorer show two words and only one is

200
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,829
different so we consider them as

201
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,839
considers them referring to the same

202
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,120
software for Volscians with

203
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,770
distinguished strict demands from loose

204
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,820
bench as the example below we compare

205
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:40,370
11.1 with from 1.0 to 1.4 first we look

206
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,860
up as a CP directory from NIST to

207
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,010
convert roshan description to version

208
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,110
list and then compared to lists since

209
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,080
they are not not exactly the same strict

210
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,450
match is obeyed however the lateral

211
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,290
covers are formal so they are lose match

212
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,310
will use these two metrics to quantify

213
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,750
inconsistency and have some interesting

214
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:06,079
findings we found that inconsistency

215
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,810
widely exists would match the various

216
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,900
websites against an VD which shows a

217
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,079
media's target because it is an official

218
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,150
database maintained by US government

219
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,670
from a diagram we can clearly see that

220
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,790
under strict matching the highest

221
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:26,569
matching rate from actual database is no

222
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:30,310
higher than 80% even if we use lose

223
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:33,260
matching consistency is still not 100%

224
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,469
besides we further studied yxy the

225
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,480
database over performs other websites we

226
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,270
found that most of the acts for the

227
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,500
database reports were posted after the

228
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,470
MVD entries are created we also studied

229
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,900
national rates or different availability

230
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,750
categories and we found that no category

231
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,670
can survive in consistency while the

232
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,890
lose meant losing lose mention rates are

233
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,949
similar that clear difference in the

234
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,960
strict matching rates for example

235
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,180
categories such as sequel injection and

236
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,280
the fire inclusion the rightmost that

237
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,069
you have the highest district mention

238
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,670
rate but a memory corruption left the

239
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:16,220
move the wand is much lower for the

240
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,890
manual examination suggests that a

241
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,090
memory corruption

242
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,120
vulnerabilities are typically more

243
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,520
complexed than others and thus requires

244
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,240
a longer time to reproduce and validate

245
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,040
as a result it is a common for MVD to

246
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,720
miss newly discovered of vulnerable

247
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,730
motions over time we found that

248
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,430
inconsistency behaves in over claims and

249
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,480
under clamps here is an example a

250
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,390
compare and VDS data against a cv e over

251
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,720
claim means MV d includes some versions

252
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:53,689
not archived in cv e under cram happens

253
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,800
when LED misses some motions listed in

254
00:11:53,690 --> 00:12:00,710
cv e furthermore we compared MV d with

255
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,829
other 5 websites using lose national

256
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,050
metrics not surprisingly both over

257
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,110
claims and under claims are very common

258
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:12,109
among different websites even if we take

259
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,770
the union of the venerable oceans across

260
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:18,290
five websites and say ve VD is still

261
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,110
covering more of oceans the more

262
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,420
interesting observation at that MV d has

263
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,570
under crammed entries compared to each

264
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,660
of the external information sources they

265
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,450
suggest that led is either suffering

266
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,040
from delays to updated entries or fails

267
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:39,680
to keep track of external information

268
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,310
the consistency rate have never keeps

269
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,900
constant instead it varies over time

270
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,910
from a diagram we can see that the

271
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,390
average imagined rate decreases slowly

272
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:53,180
over past - 20 years however in recent

273
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,430
the 3 years it has an obvious increasing

274
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,520
pattern suggesting that things are

275
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,890
getting better we're try to figure out

276
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,590
some reasons causing inconsistency one

277
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:06,140
of the causes is typos clearly in this

278
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,990
example security focus misspells

279
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,569
devotion by zero point six point eight

280
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,450
while the correct of ocean is zero point

281
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,450
eight point six humans mistakes are one

282
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,360
of the reasons another reading is most

283
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,990
reports a certain updated once created

284
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,320
we studied how MBE updates their reports

285
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,769
and surprisingly find that around 66

286
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,110
percent reports have never been updated

287
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,839
other words even if you find a nozzle

288
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,910
vulnerability Roshan and deported to NVD

289
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,399
very likely they want to take any

290
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,449
actions to your report like this example

291
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,209
in 2010 new venerable oceans are added

292
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:50,868
to security focus arrival and lead

293
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:54,319
immediacy of you 1.16 and the owning

294
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:56,329
venerable ocean so what's the security

295
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:58,639
implications of information

296
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,670
inconsistency to answer this question

297
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,529
we're there the case study we collected

298
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,040
a seven real world value abilities

299
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:09,470
covering 47 reports from five websites

300
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,139
we built a team of three of security

301
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,809
researchers to manually exam in total

302
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:18,019
one hundred and eighty five oceans it

303
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:20,719
took off for months among these motions

304
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,269
only sixty four oceans are confirmed

305
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,309
venerable more importantly we'll find

306
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,819
the twelve newly discovered venerable

307
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:30,709
oceans which have never been archived

308
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:32,899
this table shows more details of case

309
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,959
study were compelled ground shoes

310
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:39,470
established by menu verification against

311
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,229
led the red ones in the table represents

312
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,170
over claim where blue ones represents

313
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:48,679
under claim the green ones means both

314
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,929
situations exist it's clear that uh no

315
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,329
cream can leave venerable software wash

316
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:56,360
systems unpatched because some bounty

317
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:58,699
versions and not recorded and oakland

318
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,980
can waste significant to manual efforts

319
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:03,529
for security and analysts in

320
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,869
reproduction besides we're further

321
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:08,569
compared ground shoes with intersection

322
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:12,920
and a union of five websites the

323
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,079
programs he exists okay so I would like

324
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,719
to draw conclusions and less to some

325
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,419
open challenges as my talks closing

326
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,999
remark in this people we design and

327
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,790
develop a beam to extract vulnerable

328
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:28,489
software names and motions beam can also

329
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,230
be used in application scenarios like

330
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:33,679
online monitoring to report

331
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,569
inconsistency in time then we apply beam

332
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,519
for large-scale measurement which

333
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:40,939
demonstrates that inconsistency

334
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,299
information is highly prevalent finally

335
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:45,019
we did a case study and shows that

336
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,769
inconsistency in for me

337
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:51,290
has serious security implications to

338
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,810
resolve inconsistency we can standardize

339
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,089
venerability report procedure for

340
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,638
example at a one more step to Union

341
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,370
information from different sources to

342
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,250
eliminate inconsistency given that

343
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,990
manual verification is not scalable the

344
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,189
second challenge is how to fully

345
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,839
automate the vulnerability verification

346
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,849
thanks for listening we have open

347
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,519
sourced our code and data for further

348
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:20,110
questions please contact us thank you

349
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,110
again and any questions

350
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:32,139
all right we have a few minutes for

351
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,519
questions okay I will I'll start with

352
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,410
one and so you notice these

353
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,420
inconsistencies and I'm wondering how

354
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,339
many of these you can you tell are good

355
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,170
actual cause problems for humans versus

356
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:42,610
just the machine learning algorithms

357
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:49,059
when you went through and looked at

358
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:51,009
those inconsistencies oh so okay see it

359
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,420
again sure so so you notice these

360
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,949
inconsistency some of them are pretty

361
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,540
minor and they might pick up like an

362
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:57,609
exact string match some of them were

363
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,559
probably significant enough that they

364
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,699
might also throw off a human who can

365
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,429
figure out what product they were

366
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:05,438
looking for I wonder if you know if you

367
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:08,049
have a sense of kind of how much fall in

368
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,819
each of those two buckets oh so you say

369
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,740
that the two kinds of categories so why

370
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,260
is more serious than that and Nas oh and

371
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,250
he won but we do not we don't do that

372
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:21,730
kind of communications but I think this

373
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,529
is a cause if we want to do such kind of

374
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,349
a measurement we need to know the ground

375
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,419
truth and we need to measure which which

376
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,520
software is like more important there

377
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:33,070
are those so that we can do such kind of

378
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,980
measurement but we will do this as our

379
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:43,299
future work okay any other questions I

380
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,409
will ask one last one then cool so I get

381
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,908
the sense that some of this data is

382
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,159
being copied around between different

383
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:50,679
systems and as that data gets copied

384
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:52,659
inconsistencies arise do you the sense

385
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,490
from looking at that where are the kind

386
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,870
of informal sets of ground truth that

387
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,669
things are being copied from the most

388
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,500
and which of these are just places that

389
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:02,950
get copied into by looking at this data

390
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,100
yeah so some data is copied from one

391
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,289
website from to another website and well

392
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,570
what is automated source of this

393
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:12,940
information that I think I don't think

394
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,580
there is such kind of I don't know

395
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:20,399
a tomato sauce because some developers

396
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:23,918
will oppose devotions like a poxy low or

397
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:27,520
well directly report to MVD so I don't

398
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,850
see this kind of sauce thank you let's

399
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,910
think through this one more time

400
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,909
you
