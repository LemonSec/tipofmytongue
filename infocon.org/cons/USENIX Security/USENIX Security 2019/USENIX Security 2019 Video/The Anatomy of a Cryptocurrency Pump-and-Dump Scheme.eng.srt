1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,200
right so today I have the pleasure to

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:20,310
present you a study on crypto currency

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,110
pump and dump schemes which this is the

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,150
co-author paper with professor Benjamin

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,980
Lipschitz from Imperial College London

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:32,199
my name is Joshua from oh yeah my I

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,660
conducted this work when I was a PhD

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,180
student and University of st. Gallen and

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,468
a visiting scholar at Imperial College

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,140
London right now I am a postdoc at EPFL

11
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,050
so how does pump and dump work and

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,140
cryptocurrency it is similar as in a

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,720
conventional stock market so pump and

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,710
dump organizers they will first set up a

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,150
group they were they were advertised for

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,170
touting the profit of pump and dump

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:05,530
events and recruiting pump and dump

18
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,549
participants so they will set up a group

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,320
and recruit approximately more than more

20
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,889
than a thousand participants let's say

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,859
in a cryptocurrency space and then they

22
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:19,780
will announce they will issue a pre pump

23
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:23,048
announcement they will tell the group

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,499
group participants when and where the

25
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:29,020
pump will occur and they will educate

26
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:30,818
the participants about the rules of pump

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,009
and dump for example you're supposed to

28
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,679
act very fast you're supposed to buy

29
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:38,289
fast buy at low price and then you're

30
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,469
supposed to huddle what Hollow means you

31
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:44,079
know that's the crypto jargon meaning

32
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:47,499
holding the the the currency that you

33
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,380
are buying and not to sell too fast and

34
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:52,568
you're supposed to a shell at roll those

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,079
those coins promote those coins in

36
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:58,630
social network or chat box and then

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,119
comes the actual pump so right before

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,999
the pump the group organisers they are

39
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,179
they usually issued this or send out

40
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:10,000
this message this OCR proof message to

41
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:12,400
prevent machine reading so they were

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,930
sent this message and ask people to pump

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,709
that specifically I don't know if you

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,829
can read this screenshot clearly but

45
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,750
this it says enter the circle coin so

46
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,220
they have they just want to fool you

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,740
they

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,190
three coins in the message but you are

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,350
supposed to pump the C&O coin so it is a

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,320
bit confusing so you are not supposed to

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,030
you know machine read or automate the

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,190
the pump and dump process as a

53
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,530
participant so yeah after pump comes to

54
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,900
dump then the price will fall

55
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:50,970
drastically if we look at this specific

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:54,030
pump and dump case study this case that

57
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,880
he presents a specific pump and dump

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,370
event that occurred in 2018 November

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,959
2018 it was some crypto yeah I'll talk

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,160
about Curto be a little bit more later

61
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,310
on so the coin the target coin was BVB

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,670
so what was BBB it was a completely

63
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,280
dormant coin like nobody knows I don't

64
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,910
think anybody in this audience knows

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,570
anything about PvP so it was launched in

66
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,450
2000 it was launched in 2016 and

67
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,060
afterwards there were little activity

68
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,160
you could observe from either get up or

69
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,890
their tweet or their Twitter account and

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,980
they have a very low rating on crypto

71
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,170
PIA and this is exactly this type of

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,149
coin is a target coin for pump-and-dump

73
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,540
organizers because they can easily

74
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,030
manipulate the market so this chart

75
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,140
shows the price movement of this pvb

76
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,200
coin and you can see that prior to the

77
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,470
pump there's essentially no trading

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,839
activity at all whereas at the at the

79
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,790
moment when the when the when the coin

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,130
was announced you will see a a big

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:08,000
trading volume surge and also a price

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:12,000
surge so this chart shows a tick by tick

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,700
price movement of the BBB coin the coin

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,640
was announced at 7:00 7:30 p.m. and the

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,108
first trade was already placed

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,680
essentially one second after the first

87
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:28,890
announcement and then after nearly 20

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,979
seconds 20 to 30 seconds the coin price

89
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:36,169
already reached its peak and then you'll

90
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:42,438
see the price decrease so the hole

91
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:45,139
happen really really fast so in our

92
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,400
study we conducted also empirical

93
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:52,370
analyses we look at more than 300

94
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,128
telegram channels across that that could

95
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,610
that conducted or or organized pumping

96
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,800
tap events across four exchanges in

97
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,409
total we collected more than 400 pumping

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,020
different events that covered the period

99
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:12,379
of eight months the crypto exchanges

100
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,109
that we looked into in our study are by

101
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,120
Nance Beatrix crypto Pia and ubud

102
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,150
finance of Beatrix that those are big

103
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,569
exchanges and crypto PR you bet there

104
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,599
are

105
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,849
well let's I think to say that they're a

106
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,009
little bit shady is there is an

107
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,839
understatement

108
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:33,529
and that's exactly what pump and dump

109
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,339
organizers want so here we can see the

110
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:40,370
activities by exchange you'll see that

111
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:43,399
in finances Beatrix the activity is the

112
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,370
pump and dump events are not as active

113
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,560
as in crypto BIA and and you bit but you

114
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,229
know each type of exchanges they have

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,740
their own let's say perks for big

116
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:58,039
exchanges you can create a you can you

117
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,110
can attract a large number of large

118
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,710
number of traders because of their large

119
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:09,169
user base whereas in small crypto

120
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:11,899
exchanges a lot of you know well not so

121
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,698
not so high-profile we call them

122
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:16,839
coins are listed on those on those

123
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,399
exchanges and they are very easily to be

124
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,259
manipulated just with a little bit of a

125
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,149
trading volume the price can be easily

126
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:27,949
moved and we can also see that

127
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:32,419
empirically a lot of coins are pumped

128
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:35,449
more than once and here is this chart

129
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,299
shows the fake trading volume basically

130
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,810
generated by those pump and dump events

131
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,800
so those are not genuine trading volume

132
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:51,000
by long-term oriented cryptocurrency

133
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,660
those are speculators participating in

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,150
pump-and-dump

135
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,240
events that are just seeking short-term

136
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,150
gain by shorten I mean essentially only

137
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,599
a few seconds so we'll see that prior to

138
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:09,479
the pump the normal volume for three

139
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:12,750
hours and there was 900 average 900 900

140
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:17,008
Bitcoin 900 BTC whereas during the pump

141
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:21,330
hours the the volume is 9 times as much

142
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:24,509
as the normal volume that's over 8,000

143
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:30,508
bitcoins generated by pump and dump

144
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:32,789
events and in this chart we show all the

145
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:37,380
pump and dump events that we collected

146
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:41,580
all the events you can see from this

147
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:44,300
interactive website annotate it you'll

148
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,000
see you'll see every single event and

149
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,360
the the price height the price the the

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,650
pumped price as well as the the price

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:01,259
decrease after after pump and dump so

152
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:04,919
what is the profit for admins in this

153
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,469
table we show that the admins well we

154
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,900
had to have some assumptions to estimate

155
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:12,029
the the profit for pump and dump

156
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,520
organizers as you know that pump and

157
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:16,219
dump organizers they do have the insider

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,779
information they know which

159
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:22,080
cryptocurrency to pump and then they

160
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,810
announce those coins so for the profit

161
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,240
so the for admins they'll be able to buy

162
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,000
those coins prior to the pump at a low

163
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,610
price and then after they announced the

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,849
part that announced the coin that that

165
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,680
is to be pumped and all the pump intim

166
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,010
participants rushed into buying the

167
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:44,010
currency by the by the COI pushing the

168
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,439
price to a record high and then they

169
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,270
will sell those coins to you know the

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,800
pump and dump participants so a lot of

171
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,899
those participants are actually victims

172
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,880
of the pump and dump events they thought

173
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,459
that they will be faster than other

174
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,260
investors they can they can they can you

175
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,630
know buy low and sell high but at the

176
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,660
end of

177
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,900
today they're actually the victims of

178
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,240
pump-and-dump

179
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,550
admins so with those assumptions that

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,340
those admins can buy prior to the pump

181
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:14,370
to pump and dump event and they can sell

182
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:17,890
to high price we estimate that or in or

183
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:22,030
within within eight months the the

184
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:25,449
aggregate profit for the Atmos is 200

185
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,400
Bitcoin in terms of USD that is

186
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,220
approximately well bath dance probably 1

187
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,340
million and right now a Bitcoin is worth

188
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:38,320
what 10 10 grand so that's that's like 2

189
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:41,580
million in total within a span of 8

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,430
months so what do we want to do as

191
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:49,480
retail investor to counteract what maybe

192
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,189
there is information hidden and the you

193
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,210
know market price or in the features of

194
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:59,200
coins that we can observe and to predict

195
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:01,510
which coin will be will be pumped so in

196
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,100
this light we show the features that we

197
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:07,630
choose to to analyze this the little

198
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,060
disclaimer here this is not a machine

199
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,400
learning paper but we show that was just

200
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,859
very rudimentary machine learning method

201
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,680
you will be able to predict which coin

202
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,980
will be pumped in a cryptocurrency

203
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,640
exchange

204
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,760
so for example market cap is a very good

205
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:28,449
indicator because as I mentioned before

206
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,689
and coins with a small small market cap

207
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:35,020
they are easily the price their prices

208
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,850
easily can be easily moved the the

209
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,660
trading volume can be easily manipulated

210
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:44,230
and we can also we can tweak it here we

211
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,750
have also a chat showing that some some

212
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,620
admins they will they will specifically

213
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,830
choose a cryptocurrency with a very very

214
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,630
small market cap and also it from

215
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,970
empirical analysis we can also see that

216
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,900
a majority the majority of Pumped coins

217
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:06,190
they have a market cap of below 100

218
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:09,100
bitcoins and also return volatility from

219
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,980
this time series we can see that prior

220
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,910
to the

221
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,510
we can see a little hike of of the price

222
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:21,900
and that is we assume we hypothesize

223
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:24,270
caused by pump organizers they use their

224
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,280
insider information to Precourt those

225
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:32,760
coins therefore lifting the the orders

226
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,819
and then you know driving the the price

227
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,510
to go up even prior to the pump

228
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,480
and when when pump and dump participants

229
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,850
the innocent participants enter the

230
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,580
market they're already actually entering

231
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:51,270
with the price that is already lifted by

232
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:56,850
the by the pump and dump organizers who

233
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:59,910
has who have the insider information and

234
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,700
then we use yeah this is simple very

235
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,400
simple machine learning method we split

236
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,350
our sample into training validation and

237
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,569
test sample and we just want to see with

238
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:14,460
all those features we collect it using

239
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:18,300
both random forests and GLM to see if we

240
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,490
can use the most conventional machine

241
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,670
learning methods if we can predict the

242
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,070
probability of pumped coin and this

243
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,069
slide shows the hyper parameter

244
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,700
specification of random forests and GLM

245
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,890
and even with the most basic machine

246
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
learning method the the result is

247
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,210
actually astonishing so we actually get

248
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,430
this is already the validation for the

249
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,020
validation sample I skipped the chart

250
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,449
for a training sound because it looks

251
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,680
similar we have very good result with a

252
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:53,760
you see above 90 percent and with the

253
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,189
final test we have this is a bit more

254
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,590
detail with a final test we can just

255
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:03,270
just with the collaborated model we can

256
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:07,260
find detect nine coins and that will be

257
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:09,480
pumped and all of them can detect nine

258
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,630
nine coins that we will pump that we

259
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,030
will purchase prior to prior to the pump

260
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,570
and dump event and they will all be

261
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,920
pumped

262
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,930
so with this calibrated model we can

263
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,390
formulate also a

264
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,550
trading strategy for innocent traders

265
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:31,980
they can basically use the model to use

266
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,719
the use the predicted probability to

267
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,880
find out which code they are supposed to

268
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,190
purchase even before the pump and dump

269
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,320
so it's basically it's basically like

270
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,459
scam the scammers what's the purpose of

271
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,920
it that's something that we're going to

272
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:46,260
discuss later on so by basically

273
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,329
scamming the scammers you can see that

274
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,760
you can't you can you can predict the

275
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,529
pumped coins even prior to the to the

276
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,480
coin announcements that you do not have

277
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:59,970
to fall for for victim as of the of the

278
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,209
pump and dump organizers and you can

279
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:08,279
have a very good performance of above

280
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:12,779
60% of a return within a time span of

281
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,550
two and a half months so some caveats we

282
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,620
do not consider all their book data we

283
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,510
do not consider trader at rate a trade

284
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,300
by trade data these are all can be

285
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,220
considered as features in the in the

286
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,040
machine learning method and the trading

287
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,760
strategy that there's also a huge room

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,640
for improvement so the conclusion is

289
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,970
basically that the pump and dump events

290
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,050
are still permeating the cryptocurrency

291
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:42,240
space it is a fraudulent activity in the

292
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,250
United States but unfortunately you know

293
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,740
in the cryptocurrency space a lot of

294
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,560
organizers all those out of the US

295
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,600
jurisdiction so for retail investors we

296
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,160
should trace smartly just use the very

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,890
rudimentary machine learning method

298
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,930
you'll be able to you'll be able to

299
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,819
counteract you'll be able to basically

300
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,189
really profit from from trading

301
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,410
cryptocurrency instead of instead of

302
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,490
falling for the scams of pump and dump

303
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,870
organizers if I have one minute I just

304
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,170
want to show you real quick

305
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:19,350
a real pump and dump event that I record

306
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:23,310
it recently so this was organized by

307
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:27,540
Donald pump I know that name is

308
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:31,910
hilarious so this event was recorded in

309
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,349
late June so you can see that on the

310
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,219
right on the right hand side it's a

311
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,250
telegram

312
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,519
so prior to the pump you have a

313
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,259
countdown the organizer of Donald pump

314
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,519
will be like okay we have ten minutes to

315
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,040
go we have five minutes could go

316
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,949
everybody please get prepared to please

317
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,629
have your you know your screen open

318
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,979
please have your funds transfer

319
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:59,519
transferred into your you bit wallet and

320
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,240
then at yes and then at six o'clock

321
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,360
sharp

322
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,430
they they they post this coin that is

323
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
supposed to be pumped so I entered that

324
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,269
coin I I didn't really purchase the coin

325
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,250
I just want to see how the price would

326
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,319
move so this study to give you a little

327
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,339
bit more background this study the paper

328
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:19,290
was conducted and of last year so this

329
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,000
is basically just to follow up this this

330
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,199
screenshot is not included in the paper

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,209
this is basically a follow up

332
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,279
investigation of how it looks right now

333
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,888
currently in the cryptocurrency space

334
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:32,519
and you can see that after the coin

335
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:37,110
announcement we only see three okay four

336
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,480
buy orders so it's pretty silent so

337
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,730
people are not doing it anymore actually

338
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,620
people don't fall for this anymore I

339
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,839
will totally take credit for this

340
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,240
because I just feel they're after after

341
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,160
the our paper is issued just listened

342
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,220
lesbian fear and feel people are are

343
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,449
active in this in the skin or in this

344
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,889
you know pump-and-dump

345
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:58,380
activity anymore I think people are

346
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:01,560
getting aware of this and know that this

347
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,720
is not a profitable thing to do and you

348
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,958
know if you do this in a smart way if

349
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:12,689
you use machine learning so and so forth

350
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:17,010
- sorry - you know by the currencies and

351
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:18,569
not have the the organizers glean all

352
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,689
the profit then that you are actually

353
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:24,089
pushing the cryptocurrency market into a

354
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:28,049
more healthier click equilibrium

355
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:31,110
equilibrium sorry so as we can see that

356
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:33,960
pump and dump that pump and dump that

357
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,299
was not very successful we had only four

358
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,830
orders so what would happen in the tano

359
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:42,929
pump chat so they basically deleted

360
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,449
everything so they basically deleted a

361
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,770
trace of that whole history if you see

362
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,890
you can see that this chat

363
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:55,270
was from May 5th of May and afterwards

364
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,730
6th of August so between May and August

365
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,200
do they post anything they certainly did

366
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,710
but they just deleted all the bad

367
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,720
performance so we just want to warn

368
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,740
retail investors out there that this is

369
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,799
definitely a scam and do not fall for it

370
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,539
now I know I'm a bit all the time but

371
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:20,320
maybe we still have some time for one or

372
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:21,549
two questions thank you very much so

373
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,330
yeah I think we have time for maybe just

374
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:27,460
one quick question hi I'm sorry Museum

375
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,260
and really interesting talk as

376
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,870
especially the last part I was really

377
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,179
interested in real-time detection of pop

378
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,739
and dump schemes and one of the problems

379
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,169
that we see with that is you need to

380
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,039
have some some knowledge beforehand to

381
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:44,679
be able to see that this you need a

382
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,289
real-life market data which can be

383
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,120
collected by what if you you're willing

384
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,520
to invest some money there there is

385
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,739
commercial API out there but in our

386
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,408
paper for research purposes we just use

387
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,710
free free API right so do you think that

388
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:02,080
that this activity sort of leaves some

389
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,659
footprints on the on the cryptocurrency

390
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,070
Network itself the blockchain network in

391
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:08,440
particular that there are some

392
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,360
footprints that can be used without just

393
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,190
a priori knowledge and can be used to

394
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,020
characterize an activity that is ongoing

395
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,549
in real time yes I think well you're

396
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,429
talking about watching forensics that's

397
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:22,529
another topic but this the pump-and-dump

398
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:25,510
events they they take place in crypto

399
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:27,940
exchanges then they are mostly off chain

400
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,190
transactions so you cannot really detect

401
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,789
those just by downloading the blockchain

402
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,850
ledger thank thank you let's thank the

403
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:37,910
speaker again

404
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,909
you
