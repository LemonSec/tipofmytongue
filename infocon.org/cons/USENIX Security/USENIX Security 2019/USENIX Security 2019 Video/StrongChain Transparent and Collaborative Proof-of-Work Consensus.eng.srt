1
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:16,460
okay thank you very much for a nice

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,980
introduction and so my name is Pavel I

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,480
am from s utd and today I'm going to

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,279
present strong change transparent and

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,740
collaborative proof of work consensus

6
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,990
and that's joint work with Daniel and

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,359
even also from sut D and C way from

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,310
Chinese Academy of Science so I will

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,800
start with the introduction of Nakamoto

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,210
consensus and Bitcoin and what is great

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,110
about this protocol that actually you

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:41,000
can explain it in few slides so whenever

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,330
Alice would like to move some bitcoins

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,159
to to Bob she creates a transaction she

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,830
signs transaction and broadcast it to

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,619
the network of consciousness nodes which

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:55,159
are called minors then miners collect

18
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:57,619
like transactions and try to create a

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:02,839
block of these transactions and they do

20
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:06,110
it by finding such a block that its

21
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:08,658
header can satisfy a hash inequality

22
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:13,100
then the hash of its header is less than

23
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,680
some predefined I regret and efficient

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,059
way of the only efficient way of doing

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,740
this is just to incrementing boot

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,380
forcing incrementing some loans in the

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,350
header and checking this and inequality

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,740
and whenever miner finds it the miner

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,809
broadcasts such block to the network

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,658
then this block is validated by other

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,380
nodes who eventually accept it and

32
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,430
transaction is executed which means that

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:43,720
excuse me which means that basically

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:46,970
alice is moving her bitcoins to to Bob

35
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,990
miner will get will get some some reward

36
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,950
from the system and also miner will get

37
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,449
some transaction fee from values so if

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,430
you see this protocol that is blog

39
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,830
publishing is actually very interesting

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,380
because it has like free functions so it

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,179
contains transactions it also confirms

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,979
all the previous transactions because it

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,470
has like hash pointer to the previous

44
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,540
blocks and also it proves that someone

45
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,310
is like leader okay and this leader

46
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,260
election is like non interactive process

47
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,879
and thanks to this non interactive

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,980
leader election and verification

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,608
actually the protocol can scale to like

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,730
thousands of this consciousness nodes

51
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:27,569
however there is price for

52
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,060
this scalability so it's possibility of

53
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,410
inconsistency and its consistency is

54
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,629
something very unusual as for

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,220
transaction systems so in Bitcoin what

56
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,910
can happen is that two miners will

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,400
basically find roughly at the same time

58
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,170
blocks which are concurrent so then what

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,019
will happen the network will start

60
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,760
competing on these blocks they will

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,269
start mining and the protocol Divine's

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,579
defines this as soon as one chain will

63
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,610
be longer than miners should switch to

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,400
this chain and in this case the bottom

65
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,220
chain it will be not part of that of the

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,569
chain of the ledger history the

67
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,609
transactions will not count and the

68
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,700
security argument here is that as long

69
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,010
as 50% of the computing power of the

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,839
total computing hour is honest the

71
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,170
honest change should always should

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,120
always win this race however there is

73
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,399
very interesting a result which is

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
called selfish mining so here we assume

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,840
adversary with minority computing power

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,180
like 30 35 % who from time to time is

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,060
likely to find like three or two blocks

78
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,280
in row so what this selfish miner is

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,380
doing then is just keeping this block

80
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,299
secret okay so there are not published

81
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,400
to the network no one knows a lot about

82
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:49,049
them and in that case the the rest of

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,750
the network is just mining on the on the

84
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:56,280
top of known known block and when an

85
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,200
adversary actually can get some

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,260
advantage because adversary only knows

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,470
about this this secret Fork however over

88
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,138
time like the majority of the computing

89
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,290
power will basically catch up with them

90
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,299
chain and just before it happens in the

91
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,670
selfish mining the adversary will

92
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,489
publish will publish the secret fork

93
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,219
which will basically invalidate all this

94
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:24,780
visible fork created by honest honest

95
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,300
and majority and it's actually quite

96
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,669
counterintuitive what this attack

97
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,340
happens but here the core idea is that

98
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,409
like selfish miner because of variance

99
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,880
if proof-of-work will get lucky few

100
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,770
times in row and we'll just get

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,710
advantage of that

102
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,150
and this white reason why this kind of

103
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,948
attacks are is one reason why many

104
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,258
researchers actually believe is very

105
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:49,759
difficult to have like secure proof of

106
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:52,280
work protocol another aspect is that

107
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,520
with increasing Bitcoin price the mining

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,780
process got like extremely X competitive

109
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,969
so basically my neck is like zero-sum

110
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,698
game so miner started to completing and

111
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,340
like competing and like solo miners with

112
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,710
like increasing total cash power would

113
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,318
need to have spent like 10 years of for

114
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,388
instance of to find a block so what they

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,550
decided to do to stabilize the revenue

116
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:21,380
they decided to create mining pools

117
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,240
okay so money who works in the way that

118
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,520
it has like manager who basically

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,990
validates the transaction creates new

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,080
blocks and the rest of the network is

121
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,280
mining mining this turns the rest of the

122
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,750
pool is my in this transaction

123
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,659
whenever a pool finds a block

124
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,449
the reward is shirt among put pool

125
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:45,650
members however the promises from the

126
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:47,659
protocol perspective like this pool is

127
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,638
like a single entity in the protocol and

128
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:51,070
here you can see the distribution of the

129
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,080
computing power in the Bitcoin network

130
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,659
so here you see like three the biggest

131
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,719
mining pools basically have like fifty

132
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:03,770
percent of total like voting computing

133
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:05,330
power and obviously there is some

134
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,039
trade-off between the security this is a

135
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,109
selfish mining and like mining

136
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,330
experience and because of mining

137
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,380
experience like miners decided to join

138
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,280
this mining post but this like increases

139
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,960
security because the number of

140
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,068
validating nodes is getting very small

141
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:28,638
and this is one one big challenge to be

142
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:30,979
solving this process okay so I will now

143
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
describe our protocol and I will start

144
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,758
with few observations so in the current

145
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
system in Nakamoto consensus this proof

146
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,050
of work is not expressed very well we

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,448
see only blogs and this is the only unit

148
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,969
of like proof of work we see and the

149
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,969
rest of the work that miners did is just

150
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:49,039
wasted all so you select zero-sum game

151
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,080
so at the protocol level

152
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,240
miners don't have any incentives to

153
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,550
actually collaborate they they compete

154
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,649
and when they decided to collaborate by

155
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,330
creating these mining pools then

156
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:05,629
basically they create like a huge

157
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:08,508
centralization disks okay so first we

158
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,639
could modify in our instruction our

159
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,669
protocol is basically the mining process

160
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,319
so now we have two targets with

161
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,378
different difficulties we have strong

162
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,389
targets and weak target and strong

163
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:24,229
target is much more difficult to be

164
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:27,770
satisfied so the manic is very similar

165
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:31,039
so in the case when hash of the header

166
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,289
of given block is less than than then

167
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,169
strong target the miner will propagate

168
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:39,199
the block and in the case whether the

169
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:40,849
hash of this header is between these two

170
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,740
targets the miner will basically

171
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:48,110
broadcast header so it's much easier to

172
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,689
find like this this week headers than

173
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,930
the strong solution so we will have like

174
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:57,439
and we'll have like number of strokes of

175
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,580
this week headers expected as ratio

176
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,860
between these two targets

177
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,709
however when miner finds like the strong

178
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,779
solution the miner will create a block

179
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:07,309
which will contain transactions and all

180
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:11,629
week headers which point to the same

181
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:15,349
previous block okay so the mining will

182
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:17,719
go like this and as I said like it's

183
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:20,389
much easier to find like a weak headers

184
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:22,430
and conceptually you can see at least

185
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,529
that like this week headers is basically

186
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,229
like a boat like a support for the block

187
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:30,999
and blocks are created through this

188
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:33,198
strong strong solution strong headers

189
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:35,269
okay so another modification we

190
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:37,968
introduced is like fork resolution so we

191
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:40,219
follow the strongest chain rule which is

192
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,729
like similar to what what bitcoin does

193
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,190
however the one modification is that we

194
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:50,300
like to change the calculation of the

195
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:52,819
strength of given chain so basically the

196
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,149
chain strength is computed as number of

197
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:59,180
the block of this chain multiplied but

198
00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,769
how but multiplied by how difficult is

199
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,099
to find like this

200
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:06,889
strong header so here Tmax is like a

201
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,809
just a constant and we sum and we are

202
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:11,689
also like number of the week headers

203
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:13,910
which are even given chang x how

204
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:16,639
difficult it's fine you know given week

205
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,829
week header and multiplied by some

206
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:23,899
parameter delta i will discuss later so

207
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,878
basically in this case as presented

208
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,429
where we have two concurrent block bi

209
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:31,819
and bi prime the miners will just decide

210
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:33,139
immediately to follow bi bi because it

211
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:36,699
just stronger it has more discrete

212
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:38,779
colors so in our protocol we have like

213
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:42,529
like this proof-of-work power is

214
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:45,920
expressed better so it helps us with

215
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,739
solving the selfish mind attacks and the

216
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,509
intuition why it helps us is the

217
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:54,049
following so let's just assume that we

218
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:56,569
have like this week target which is like

219
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,360
self to maximum value which means that

220
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:02,540
every miner would just compute will just

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,369
publish all hash is computed okay so in

222
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,549
this case we represent the like

223
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:09,290
computing power like perfectly and

224
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:10,879
selfish mind is impossible because like

225
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,719
30 percent adversary would always

226
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,100
compute 30% of total hashes obviously we

227
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,920
cannot like sent to the network called

228
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:24,799
the hashes so then we can balance this

229
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,019
by by by changing this this this week

230
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:31,579
target for the level that is acceptable

231
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:33,889
by the network okay so another element

232
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,599
we change is like yours and incentive so

233
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:38,600
we have base reward as in Bitcoin which

234
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,990
is here than out it are so block

235
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,499
creators receive like this base reward

236
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,029
and transaction fees and we other finder

237
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:49,699
basically gets a reward which is

238
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,279
proportional to how difficult it was to

239
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:54,790
find a given header multiplied by some a

240
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,589
parameter gamma I will mention later

241
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,360
what is critical than a strong chain is

242
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,299
not like zero-sum game anymore so

243
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,699
rewards are independent and not shirt so

244
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:07,189
block creators can only actually gain by

245
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:09,219
including quick headers and there is no

246
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:12,349
revert limits per block which implies

247
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,270
inflation and as Bitcoin has like

248
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,070
built-in default deflation

249
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,930
it's like it might be like seen as very

250
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,210
controversial by some parts of the

251
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,760
Bitcoin community however is in line

252
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:25,820
with some recent research about security

253
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:31,970
of insecurity of like a Bitcoin

254
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:33,290
deflation okay so the first result I

255
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,450
would like to present you is like the

256
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,819
centralization which we define like

257
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,060
reward variance so on the left you can

258
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,210
see coefficient of variation depending

259
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,829
on the miners miners our so what you can

260
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,010
see is that miners in strong chain can

261
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:51,380
have like 100 percent weaker computing

262
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:55,939
power but still have the same reward

263
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:58,580
variance as in as in Bitcoin okay so how

264
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,320
it translates to like mining pools so on

265
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,630
the right you can see list of the

266
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,090
largest mining pools in Bitcoin and they

267
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,740
share in the total computing power so

268
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,390
for instance the the largest mining will

269
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,770
be decieved calm which has like 80

270
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,180
percent of a bit computing power

271
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,699
instruction they equivalent mining pool

272
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,000
with the same variance of reward could

273
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,650
be as small as 0.25 percent so

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,400
effectively we could have like a large

275
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:30,079
number of like small pools ok security

276
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,510
is another aspect I would like to

277
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,970
discuss briefly so we have week headers

278
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,470
so the protocol is rough a bit more

279
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,710
difficult to analyze them and then

280
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,360
Bitcoin because we have like new factor

281
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:44,080
however we analyze this so on the left

282
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,930
you can see a variant of selfish mining

283
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,090
compared to Bitcoin so for instance if

284
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:54,560
we take strong chain with number of

285
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:57,080
expected headers 1,024 in like one block

286
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,510
you can see that in Bitcoin like the

287
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,270
selfish mining starts to be profitable

288
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:05,420
when adversaries like larger than like

289
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:08,750
33 percent so instruction we move it to

290
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:12,620
like 44 45 percent which is like 10%

291
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:17,030
better is actually pretty close to who

292
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,220
this 50 percent bound okay we also did

293
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,560
some initial analysis with Markov

294
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,090
decision process to find like optimal

295
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,930
strategy but we didn't find anything

296
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,850
better than

297
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,519
significantly better than the one prison

298
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,040
here also on the right you can see

299
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,560
adversaries who would like to not

300
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,569
broadcast her her week headers so you

301
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,739
can see basically adversaries losing a

302
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:41,000
lot in this case which implies that

303
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,279
adversary has like incentive actually to

304
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,630
help the protocol to broadcast whatever

305
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,459
she computed so another aspect of abuse

306
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,139
so usually blockchain protocols are

307
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:52,849
analyzed in this with the security in

308
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,040
mind so basically they define security

309
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,759
as advantage of the adversary how much

310
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,389
adversary can gain and so on so we also

311
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:04,490
analyze how how adversary can actually

312
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:06,440
abuse the system so one interesting

313
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,199
strategy we found we call this rightful

314
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,509
mining is that where adversary does not

315
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,819
include miner doesn't include weak

316
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,350
headers of other miners so add versa is

317
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,649
publishing called a weak hazard but is

318
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,980
not including other miners with headers

319
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:23,389
so in terms of like absolute payoff

320
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,839
adversaries gaining nothing it's like

321
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:30,670
the same as it was however it can harm a

322
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:35,509
bit a bit other miners which you can see

323
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:37,459
on the left so the reason why it works

324
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:42,009
is that this low variance actually helps

325
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:44,569
also adversary to to apply this strategy

326
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,839
we found very interesting trade-offs so

327
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:49,430
security versus abuse versus efficiency

328
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,850
so I mentioned about this gamma which is

329
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:57,079
like parameter regulating how we headers

330
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,850
are rewarded and Delta which is like how

331
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:02,029
weak headers count in the computation of

332
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,259
of the chain strength and they have like

333
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,240
very important influence on the

334
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:07,759
properties of the system so when we

335
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,550
increase gamma it improves like security

336
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,410
decentralization when we curse like

337
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,519
Delta it like mitigates this abuse

338
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,759
despiteful mining

339
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,600
however combined with a higher Network

340
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:22,639
latency it increases for trade so there

341
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,639
are some ideas how to mitigate also

342
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,519
spiteful mining but for instance bank

343
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,980
block finders proportional to the number

344
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,680
of found found

345
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,200
week headers however with adjusting this

346
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,180
parameter we can just we can just find

347
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,160
nice balance between these trade-offs

348
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:44,770
and our choice is to have like higher

349
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,810
higher gamma and low Delta okay so we

350
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,880
imported our protocol for efficiency we

351
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,670
modify bitcoin headers we added like

352
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,760
coin base current base address field in

353
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,280
the header we also added like a binding

354
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,890
transaction to basically protect

355
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,449
integrity of the sweet headers and with

356
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,640
1024 expected with we colors around

357
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,880
which is number we suggest the bandwidth

358
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:14,110
overhead introduces like 6% in relation

359
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:17,080
to Bitcoin and total CPU overhead is

360
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,790
like 50 milliseconds to validate all

361
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,390
those headers however it's it's an

362
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,620
optimizing implementation okay so in

363
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,630
conclusion I would like to say that

364
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,880
expressing proof of work more accurately

365
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,820
with align incentives provides multiple

366
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,370
benefits so first of all we have like

367
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,440
better decentralization a security and

368
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,180
also we improve other purposes like

369
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,560
timestamp accuracy this is South Africa

370
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,410
and then we have time to talk about but

371
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,449
you can look into the paper the changes

372
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,270
are relatively simple and easy to the to

373
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,000
the Bitcoin and in the future or on

374
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,920
going to work we work on the proof of

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,620
work set a proof of stake setting for

376
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,260
for similar protocol and extended

377
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,660
analysis with abuse modeling of other

378
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,990
systems and combinations of other

379
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,180
systems with with strategy thank you

380
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:11,459
very much I'm happy to take questions

381
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:11,459
[Applause]

382
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,698
hi nice talk one of the reasons we have

383
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,020
mining pools is not the surface mining

384
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,419
is the fact that there is very low

385
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,129
Network latency between the pool nodes

386
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:31,730
like they have preparatory protocols

387
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,400
have you modeled this when you solve the

388
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,220
difference between Strom Seine and

389
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,529
classic Bitcoin no we haven't model that

390
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,799
is it possible to put it in the system

391
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:45,020
like I how much more latency would be if

392
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,120
you actually decentralized sure so I

393
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,370
think it would be possible with some

394
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,129
assumptions to simulate that the problem

395
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,168
is that like ideally we could we could

396
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,480
use like Bitcoin network and check it

397
00:17:54,169 --> 00:18:00,559
but that probably will not happen soon

398
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,470
at least but I think that the main main

399
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,529
point is that like we could have like we

400
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,200
could give this but by minimizing this

401
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:11,480
reward variance we could like x factor

402
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,890
of 10 or 20 and I think that network

403
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,039
could handle that and that should be

404
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,919
acceptable given that like the block

405
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,539
frequencies like 10 minutes and so on so

406
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,570
I think that that should be possibly

407
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:25,730
okay okay then I have another question

408
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,500
have you looked into like the other

409
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,850
protocol like fruit chains that do very

410
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,649
similar things you know so you can

411
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,689
strong block sure have you compared with

412
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:34,520
oh sure so you can look into related

413
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,399
work or work on our section so we

414
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,889
discuss yeah there is a bunch of similar

415
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:41,539
work but you can discuss a new

416
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,580
compartment is there like a key thing

417
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:45,620
that's novel to you that we had have in

418
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,360
mind compared to the other right so most

419
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,370
of the most of the systems which use

420
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,740
this kind of weak solutions they build

421
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,080
like chain of these weak solutions

422
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,820
together and the problem with this this

423
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,189
approaches is that you can do selfish

424
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,520
manic on this chain of quick headers

425
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,240
right

426
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,168
and yeah so threw in there okay thank

427
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,169
you very much thank you very much
