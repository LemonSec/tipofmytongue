00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,910
Thank You Roger here two percent that

2
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:16,980
were the study of location privacy

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,590
across such an application this is joint

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,689
work with the Spiros Mattias and Stefan

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,550
who at the time that we were doing this

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,560
thing where that Swiss data Science

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,480
Center and the University of Darmstadt

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,348
since then they left those places that's

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,320
where you're stuck with me so I hope to

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,700
leave to spurious expectations

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,410
crowdsourcing applications are those in

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,120
which service providers instead of

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,788
collecting data themselves they try to

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,280
get the crowd to give them data and

15
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,650
concretely in this project we started

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,210
mobile crowdsourcing applications in

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,769
which service providers use the mobile

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,360
clients for the users they give them

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,960
applications so they give them a

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,100
specific mobile devices to collect

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,800
geo-located measurements that allow them

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,420
to see how the world is going on and you

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,548
are used to use these things like for

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,310
instance ways or OpenStreetMaps

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,530
or such services but the fact that

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,860
people can use these mobile services to

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,790
just collect humongous amount of data

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,539
actually is very nice it has

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:23,010
democratized the capability to collect

30
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:26,580
large data sets and this has made for

31
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:29,430
instance scientists write on these

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,408
technologies more and more there's very

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,940
much leverage for citizen science where

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,970
people just need to take measurements

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,479
about sounds in cities radiation about

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,530
the world we have even a new version of

37
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,299
Google Street maps where people just ask

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,340
citizens to take photos of places so

39
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,619
that we can replicate in an open source

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,930
the same type of services and this is a

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,970
growing ecosystem since we started this

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,420
project not only a lot of applications

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,179
appears but also a platform side spot on

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,420
here in which you can just build your

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,130
new mapped crowdsourcing project they

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,689
will help you to build the app that will

47
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,090
help you to map the results so that you

48
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,590
can get new data and because your

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,870
privacy people otherwise you would not

50
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,200
be here on a Friday afternoon after a

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,180
week of talks by now you're all in panic

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,339
about this thing right we are collecting

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,900
here located measurements but also

54
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,880
because your privacy people probably

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,770
you're thinking but

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,170
come on why should talking about this

57
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,500
thing didn't we solve the location

58
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,239
privacy problem already by now we have

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,490
optimal perfect efficient privacy

60
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,700
preserving mechanisms but while doing

61
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,830
this project what we discovered is that

62
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,839
so far the literature has been focusing

63
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,210
on this particular location-based

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,880
services find the nearest restaurant

65
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:50,000
find my friend or less checking in

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,420
Foursquare to become a mayor which makes

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,790
which in many companies but it's a very

68
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,799
particular service but these others are

69
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,049
very different first of all they don't

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,750
focus on the location they focuses on

71
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,190
the measurements so they also collect

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,170
measurement with the location and the

73
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,140
utility of these applications is on the

74
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,000
measurement domain these people care

75
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,640
about what it comes with the location

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,260
not the location itself and as opposed

77
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,480
to location with service with the

78
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,030
utilities user centric so when I look

79
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,369
for the nearest buy gas station the unit

80
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,920
is for me and is only based on my

81
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,840
location in the case of mobile

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,359
crowdsourcing services this is a

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,800
collective utility so the service

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,140
provider would take the measurements of

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,440
several users on the same location and

86
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,359
use that to get utility out of it and we

87
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,980
also serve that the collection pattern

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,680
and the movement pattern of using in the

89
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,109
system's is different in location-based

90
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,640
service we have often a sporadic type of

91
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,920
things a step or from the matting and

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,799
routing all of the rest are we just

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,470
check on the services from time to time

94
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,750
many of the mobile cloud services

95
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,790
actually have continuous locations where

96
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,920
people keep measuring because that's

97
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,160
actually what user useful for the

98
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,140
service so we conjectured that this

99
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,420
would have a very different privacy

100
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,089
implications and to make this study we

101
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,250
use publicly available data from two of

102
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,170
these mobile crowdsourcing projects one

103
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,560
of them is safecast safecast is a

104
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,690
platform that after the fukushima big

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,690
explosion decided that it was important

106
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,490
to know about the radiation in the world

107
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,770
and because no government actually kind

108
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,960
of finds less map how much radiation are

109
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,690
we living on they decided to take

110
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,380
advantage of people they build an open

111
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,900
hardware device that measures radiation

112
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,690
you can buy it and then users that this

113
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,179
device will collect the location time

114
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,700
and irradiation measurement and will

115
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,920
send this back to the safe cast server

116
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,190
and safeguard would use this information

117
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,140
to map radiation levels across the world

118
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,480
such as the map that you see there it

119
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,550
will try to find hot spots and new

120
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,560
variations and specific things that

121
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,600
happen and they also publish all of

122
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,910
these data with an API and their data

123
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,390
policies open data use it for whatever

124
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,220
you want and this data comes identified

125
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,080
many of the people just upload this data

126
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,690
with their names or with a pseudonym and

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,030
this data set we used after some

128
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,070
cleaning five fifty six point seven

129
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,349
million data points for five hundred and

130
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,409
four users and we also studied another

131
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,740
service called radio cells that aims at

132
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,630
making a mapping of the tailpiece

133
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,190
telecom infrastructure so different

134
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,020
service providers where do they have

135
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,780
their antennas what is the service they

136
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,880
provide to provide you some way of

137
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,619
controlling actually the surco providers

138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,240
that rule our world and here people

139
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,430
provide the location the timestamp the

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,680
cell information and the strength of the

141
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,630
signal as well as the device properties

142
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,970
so that we know if this depends from

143
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,650
whether they have a Sam Soon or LG or

144
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,270
all these things and they don't publish

145
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,159
the data set with names as in the case

146
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,260
of south caste they publish an

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,720
anonymized data set but because they

148
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,400
publish all the device properties will

149
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,680
show in the paper that is very very easy

150
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,840
to just link points from different

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,300
people and just find their trajectories

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,210
and here we used after some cleaning

153
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,300
again four million measurements from 568

154
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,039
users and you may be wondering well I

155
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,660
mean you're going around doing privacy

156
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,700
analysis on data that people put on the

157
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,070
internet if you were here before court

158
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,570
already say not because something is in

159
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,090
the internet means that researchers can

160
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,790
go and do whatever they want with it

161
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,650
so we went through our IRB which in the

162
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,350
case of EPFL is called human research

163
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,659
ethics committee and we had a couple of

164
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,280
iterations with them to devise a good

165
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,560
protocol in which we're doing this the

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,219
main concern was the legitimacy of the

167
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,470
data you

168
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,600
that we just found online and the lack

169
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,830
of consent of these users for us to

170
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,540
write the data we convinced them that

171
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,550
privacy valuation of public applications

172
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,980
is very important this is kind of

173
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,130
privacy white hacking right if it's

174
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,690
important for us to analyze the security

175
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,909
of systems that are deployed and affect

176
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,590
people it is also important for the

177
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,300
community to analyze the privacy

178
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,419
implications of just putting data online

179
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,400
in such high volumes but we agreed that

180
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,040
we would try to have a minimal impact on

181
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,080
these users so not do blanket attacks on

182
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,320
everybody there but just try to limit

183
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,669
our inferences to a bit of data points

184
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,440
to demonstrate that attacks are possible

185
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:34,210
and we also they were very a pressing on

186
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,620
why do you not think consent from these

187
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,870
users they will go like well we don't

188
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,700
have their emails and actually if you

189
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,680
make us find their emails who are

190
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,590
collecting more data and misusing even

191
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,390
more data or in the case of radio cells

192
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,010
we can t anonymize them because we can

193
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,539
trace them so we can find their homes we

194
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,400
can find their work so we know we can do

195
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,040
this thing but now you're asking us to

196
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,450
breach privacy to use consent so in the

197
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,640
end they were kind of come down about

198
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,760
that we agreed to only publish

199
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,120
aggregator anonymize data of some

200
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,940
particular cases and we disclosed all of

201
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,830
this to the applications before we came

202
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,200
public and this happened in August last

203
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:15,460
year which tell us tells you how many

204
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,500
times the paper got rejected before so

205
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,539
how do we need to check whether we could

206
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,340
breach the privacy of the users we have

207
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,350
geo-located data we know that this

208
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,650
enables a lot of location of

209
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,570
location-based inferences and what we

210
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,820
wanted to stress is that this location

211
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,799
this inference can be automated in

212
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,620
particular there is a lot of literature

213
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,319
from the mobile community and the Ubik

214
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,089
company etc where they just deploy more

215
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,940
and more algorithms to just extract

216
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:45,400
information from location and to show

217
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,190
how simple this is this is the only

218
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,170
privacy attack in this conference that

219
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,660
doesn't use machine learning we just use

220
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,719
a very simple clustering algorithm from

221
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,939
the 90s called DB scan which what it

222
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,459
does is given a point it just tries to

223
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,420
find a point that is close by if it

224
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:03,160
popped the

225
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,689
find this point then goes and tries to

226
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,420
find another point that is close by

227
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,640
until there are no more points close by

228
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,130
at that point it considers all of those

229
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,780
a cluster and if this class that has a

230
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,400
minimal amount of points with the sign

231
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,589
then it returns it to us

232
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,850
otherwise decides this is not important

233
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,560
and goes and try to find another cluster

234
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,030
and this is very nice because we don't

235
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,430
need to define the number of clusters we

236
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,170
want the number of points no the shape

237
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,939
of the cluster which is very useful for

238
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,890
our users that actually move in

239
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,410
different shapes and the clustering

240
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,449
technique itself files this without

241
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:42,040
asked the fine in it so to validated we

242
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,760
kind of attacked a bunch of users in

243
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,459
safecast

244
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,090
and we follow a twisted clustering first

245
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,420
we just filter measurements in working

246
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:57,040
hours so that we would not profile users

247
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,930
in their recreational activities we try

248
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,209
to find relevant courses we divvy scan

249
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,099
and we only took those that were longer

250
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,350
than 30 minutes because we find out that

251
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,210
there are many clusters that last for

252
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,100
very little which we conjecture works

253
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,870
things like traffic lights or things

254
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,280
like that will users were stopping for a

255
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,400
while and we didn't consider those

256
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,110
relevant and then we did a second step

257
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,270
in which we broke this cluster because

258
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,590
some of them were very big in Madden

259
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,329
actually one of us there was a

260
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,910
university order the company that has a

261
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,040
big campus that wouldn't allow us to

262
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,110
really identify a point so Google break

263
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,140
down and for the small clusters we took

264
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,730
the centroid and use online service to

265
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,800
reverse geocoding and get the address

266
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,860
and many of these services already tell

267
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,589
you what kind of building is this point

268
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,690
on and then because these people had

269
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,490
their names we're going to social medium

270
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:50,590
validated whether the inferences we have

271
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:53,140
done were correct so we try to infer the

272
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,990
workplace of people for 34 safecast

273
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,990
users as we said before these are very

274
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,170
few because we try to limit very much

275
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,120
the damage that we could make still our

276
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,479
reviewers if you're here one of them

277
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:11,959
call us quite creepy which I agree but

278
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,970
we needed to do it we had 35 percent

279
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,799
but we also have to say that for nine of

280
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,899
them we couldn't validate our inference

281
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,149
because we couldn't find their work in

282
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,910
place on the Internet the rest of them

283
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:27,049
either LinkedIn or Facebook who reveal

284
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:30,019
what they worked we also found out 50

285
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:31,759
pairs of friends of people that were at

286
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,639
the same time on the same place so we

287
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,559
would infer that they were friends sort

288
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,179
of had some sort of relationship which

289
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,420
we could validate just by checking

290
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:43,399
Facebook or Twitter and during all of

291
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,559
these not because we actually wanted

292
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,720
just well debugging we looked a lot

293
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,118
about the point of interest and we find

294
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,670
many of the things we found Freemasons

295
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:54,679
we find Scientologists we have a guy

296
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,569
that has a Tesla because could stop on

297
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:59,689
every Tesla station between Arizona and

298
00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:02,509
Chicago and we find many other things

299
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:04,368
that actually if you want to automate

300
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:06,889
probably they also can be done we just

301
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:08,360
didn't want to do it and once the price

302
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,279
you're finding is that are supposed to

303
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,279
location-based services or many other

304
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,739
services the amount of privacy is not to

305
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,600
be correlated with the amount of point

306
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,860
these people release and this is because

307
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,139
people in these applications have

308
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,759
different behaviors many of them and in

309
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,329
particular they want to give a lot of

310
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:28,759
points those are good contributors they

311
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,799
just go around and take measurements in

312
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,019
many places just to contribute more data

313
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,429
to the platform and therefore they take

314
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,309
measurements in places that are not

315
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:40,209
relevant to them or they never stay at a

316
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:42,738
particular place for a long time and

317
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:45,679
just to make sure that we were not lying

318
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:47,829
here we did a very small cross

319
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,519
correlation cross validation on

320
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,040
OpenStreetMaps in the case of

321
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,860
OpenStreetMaps they do not allow you to

322
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,319
automatically crawley their API to

323
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,749
retrieve routes and GPS points from

324
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,939
users so we have to do this manually and

325
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:03,350
yeah this was a very small set because

326
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:07,069
there is so much time that the one kind

327
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,139
of spend clicking on a website so thus

328
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:10,759
location privacy preserving mechanisms

329
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,559
do the ones that we have the sign help

330
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,889
these people we study the state of the

331
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,299
art so those mechanism a Sonos addition

332
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,470
and in this case we use your

333
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:22,009
distinguished ability which gives

334
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,630
location privacy and very simple you

335
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,940
just add laplacian noise in the

336
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,860
two dimensional space to just obfuscate

337
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,690
the noise so from the yellow one here

338
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,270
you would appear in one of these red

339
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,660
dots and we also tried variations that

340
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:38,390
are better Bo both from a privacy budget

341
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,370
so in the releases strategy means that

342
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,350
you would reduce the noise if you don't

343
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,000
are very far away from the previous

344
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,360
point you will reduce so that you don't

345
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,220
lose epsilon budget and we also checked

346
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,640
optimal remapping which is a technique

347
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,500
for utility in which if near-end could

348
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,390
give you all of these points there in

349
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,880
red you could choose the one that gives

350
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:05,930
you the most utility and for using that

351
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:07,250
okay they have the ones that they could

352
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,079
use the they would take the pond that

353
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,210
has the modulating we have

354
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,640
generalization which just check the pond

355
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,590
and a grid and we have hiding when we

356
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,380
don't report all of the locations right

357
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:22,220
we can check idle report every that many

358
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,630
meters or around the percentage and the

359
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,670
performance of these defenses we

360
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,640
measured them using the areas with the

361
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,260
use of moves and also the point of

362
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,750
interest so this would be the point of

363
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,910
interest that we infer and once we apply

364
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,980
the defense we would say we'll have a

365
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,980
false negative if we miss the cluster of

366
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,870
the point of interest or we miss or will

367
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,720
have false positives if we infer from

368
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,330
places and we check precision and recall

369
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,100
as the privacy metrics and we would say

370
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:52,880
we have a lot of privacy if recall is

371
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,130
small or if precision is small how do

372
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,240
the differences operate so for your

373
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:01,250
indistinguishability we see that a the

374
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,650
defense really does not depend on the

375
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,560
parameter depend on the users it would

376
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,290
have very different performance and only

377
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,119
when you really increase the noise you

378
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,209
would actually reduce the precision and

379
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,760
the recall to zero for rounding we

380
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,070
observed that only when you round to

381
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,270
actually two decimals if you have very

382
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:27,260
very big grids you could get any privacy

383
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:30,020
and for hiding hiding at random does not

384
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,780
help because you because people generate

385
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,210
points every day right you would still

386
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,610
see a lot of patterns and even release

387
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,439
we could have

388
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,299
some kind of information again because

389
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:42,790
people repeat many many days the same

390
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:45,459
location it could still show up for many

391
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,170
of the users and again uses with more

392
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,209
data surprising we are protected better

393
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,809
but that is a question of the mobility

394
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,040
patterns and not of the amount of data

395
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,829
but the product here comes with the

396
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,170
utility we use the map so we just

397
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,508
compare the radiation map with and

398
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,519
without privacy preserving mechanisms

399
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:06,670
and we use the code from the providers

400
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,339
because they are an open-source project

401
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,199
we can just use it and we find that

402
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,389
effective defenses have significant

403
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,279
utility loss what this means is that if

404
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,049
you would just take Fukushima and just

405
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,009
make a grid over it

406
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:23,399
53 of the points in the grid would move

407
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,290
from normal radiation to dangerous and

408
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,670
283 MOOC that would be normally

409
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,469
extremely dangerous would appear as

410
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,019
normal because of the noise that you

411
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,970
could introduce so the map could not be

412
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,369
trusted anymore and that is actually not

413
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,220
useful and safe cos people told us this

414
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,899
is not something we can tolerate another

415
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,610
very interesting finding is that optimal

416
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,059
remapping does not work optimal

417
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,549
remapping

418
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:48,040
finds utility thinking about where

419
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:49,809
people are the most time but that does

420
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,759
not mean that you want to remap all of

421
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,980
the measurements to that particular

422
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,079
point because that is not the same

423
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,449
utility as in location-based services

424
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,910
and we observe a similar utility dekha

425
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:03,849
datum for radio cells and while talking

426
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,678
with safecast they told us that this is

427
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,659
not the only thing they do they also

428
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,899
care a lot about this hotspot detection

429
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,639
so we compared what hotspot detection

430
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,708
would be between the original and the

431
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:17,229
other says so we have the original on

432
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,539
the top left and we see that depending

433
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,699
of the mechanism that we have and there

434
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:24,010
a lot of hotspot would appear and that's

435
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,630
very problematic because false positives

436
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,459
are expensive every time they have a hot

437
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,230
spot they send someone to look there and

438
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,970
false negatives are very dangerous

439
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,100
because if they don't see a hot spot

440
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,950
they cannot analyze it so none of the

441
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,549
techniques actually help for this so how

442
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:42,309
can we help well we can try crypto based

443
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:44,230
solutions they are very expensive but

444
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,110
phones are powerful nowadays so please

445
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,059
try your best and it's important to

446
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,030
think about how to maintain data check

447
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,100
publication be

448
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,690
for them being able to open science is

449
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,780
something very important they don't want

450
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,730
to be completely closed learning for

451
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,170
lousy data it turns out that that's what

452
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,120
machine learning do I'm sure that

453
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,800
somebody here can come up with a way of

454
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,449
actually learning from this you

455
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,240
distinguishability noise some of this

456
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,520
hot spot and work more in privacy

457
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,530
evaluation techniques for them we have

458
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,450
our code online but we would be happy to

459
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,399
work with any usability researcher and

460
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,000
how to turn this into something really

461
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,560
useful for users so take away mobile

462
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,510
crowdsourcing and crossing in general

463
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,520
comes with new privacy challenges and

464
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,740
these are privacy communities that

465
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,690
really their privacy conscious when we

466
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,130
contacted them they said we really want

467
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,720
to do this thing but we don't have good

468
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,430
techniques so we just go with whatever

469
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,980
because we're altruistic and we believe

470
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,840
in science so engage with them they will

471
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,700
be helped of having solutions and just

472
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,500
look in your institution probably there

473
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,510
is some social scientists or biologists

474
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,760
that is already doing this and will be

475
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:54,590
happy to get your superpowers thank you

476
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:56,960
very much we've got time for a question

477
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,110
while the next person comes up and sets

478
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,110
up

479
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,500
come on let's thank you very interesting

480
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,950
a small question just to be sure

481
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,270
so the first database was to use

482
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,279
pseudonyms

483
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,830
but if ensign correctly in your research

484
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,620
you did not actually rely on or explore

485
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:22,080
the pseudonyms mrs. krater you only used

486
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,850
the measurements in ourselves right so

487
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,918
if the measurements did not have any

488
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,899
identifiers that would not make any

489
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,690
difference correct

490
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,970
so for safecast they did they were

491
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:36,270
identified and we didn't do know we use

492
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,760
we linked all of that data of our girls

493
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,889
sorry included yeah we only analyzed

494
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,260
points per person to find their

495
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,909
particular home location in the other

496
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,950
data said they were in anonymize but we

497
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,510
could link points together and we

498
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,010
actually could find where they lived

499
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,480
we just didn't the anonymize them

500
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,640
because we didn't think it was ethical

501
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,649
but we use the information that we could

502
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,610
link different data points to make our

503
00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:03,149
inferences so in the first database you

504
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,678
did use identifiers but even if we

505
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:07,350
didn't have identifies because they

506
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,330
release the GPS per second right it's

507
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:14,668
not true it's not difficult to just find

508
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:16,250
Fred actor ease and okay thank you thank

509
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:20,190
you again

510
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,190
[Applause]
