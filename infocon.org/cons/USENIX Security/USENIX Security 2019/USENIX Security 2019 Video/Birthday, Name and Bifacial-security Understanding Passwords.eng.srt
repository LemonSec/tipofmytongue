1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,250
and since everyone for coming so I'm UNT

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,200
an assistant professor from University

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,810
of Virginia this their joint work with

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,299
ping and ping from Peking University and

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,119
they'll be all from Wuhan University

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,029
so unfortunately thing cannot be here so

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,269
I'm here to present a paper on behalf of

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:35,239
the team in this work we're looking to

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,840
the differences of Chinese passwords and

10
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,419
English passwords we found that Chinese

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,540
passwords are so different from English

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,200
passwords so that our previous insights

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:51,110
and tools for English passwords might

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,420
not really apply we believe there's a

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,330
great potential to study this kind of

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,720
across cultural problems

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:03,220
so with that I'll start so as when you

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,710
just mentioned password is everywhere

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:09,590
nowadays users from all over the world

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,610
are using passwords to protect their

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:17,090
online accounts for example every day we

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,940
use passwords to log into Gmail services

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:23,659
log in to healthcare services to log

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:27,080
into online banking services since the

25
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:30,260
passwords are created by human then

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,830
virtually passwords are influenced by

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,810
the native languages there are so many

28
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:40,759
different languages all over the world

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,520
so there may be lots of different

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,690
patterns in the passwords from different

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,539
languages however most of current

32
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,740
password security research are focusing

33
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:57,229
only on English passwords therefore did

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,330
great insights and tools from the

35
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,729
English password studies might not

36
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,270
really apply to passwords in other

37
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,340
languages unfortunately we still have

38
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,669
very limited understandings about

39
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,909
password from other languages for

40
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:16,189
example although Chinese is spoken by so

41
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,810
many people we only have two papers

42
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:21,290
after you look into the Chinese

43
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,290
passwords you can say that there is a

44
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,510
huge gap here so to pray to

45
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,140
we want to answer the following two

46
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,959
research questions first what are the

47
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,690
structural or semantic coaching listings

48
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,190
of Chinese passwords comparing to

49
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,739
English passwords second given the

50
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,200
differences in these passwords how to

51
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:49,400
measure the strength of Chinese

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,119
passwords in the following I will show

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,989
you how we solve these two problems and

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,989
let's get start with our data sets in

55
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:03,440
this work we use my password data sets

56
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:06,700
from high profile websites this password

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:12,019
data sets are from data breaches from

58
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:15,709
2009 to 2012 sixth are Chinese websites

59
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:19,129
and three are English websites in total

60
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:22,849
we have over 100 million passwords you

61
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:25,760
can tell that this password websites are

62
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:28,730
from different type of web services such

63
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,230
as Social Forum gaming ecommerce and

64
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,840
developer forums before I talk about the

65
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,929
details our study I want to give you a

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,139
teaser so this is a table of the top 10

67
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,099
passwords on all the nine websites we

68
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:48,380
studied the six green ones are Chinese

69
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:52,339
websites and the three red ones are

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:55,790
English websites first you can probably

71
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,000
already tell that both Chinese users and

72
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:02,679
English users believe the best password

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,609
is one two three four five six

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,739
the only exception is CS e n4 c @ en the

75
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:12,079
password the most popular password is

76
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:18,548
one two three four five six seven eight

77
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:21,530
nine can anyone guess the reason yes

78
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:24,679
CS TL is the only Chinese websites that

79
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,190
actually have the password policy that

80
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,030
requires length to be about eight digits

81
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:35,020
and also you might also tell that for

82
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,179
the Chinese passwords they mostly are

83
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,280
created by digits and for English

84
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,940
passwords the popular ones are mostly

85
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,309
created by letters if you take a colder

86
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,949
look you might find some of the digit

87
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,879
based Chinese passwords are very easy to

88
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,979
guess like 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 but

89
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,330
some of them might seem to be a little

90
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,560
bit random to your right

91
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:03,310
what does 5 2 0 1 3 1 forming why so

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,960
many people choose it I said maybe some

93
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,479
Chinese people already know the answer

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,469
it's because it's actually means I love

95
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:14,139
you forever so it turns out the Chinese

96
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,389
users there are using similar similar

97
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,150
pronunciations of the digits to

98
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,759
represent this phrase so actually in

99
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,169
Chinese it is why any showing in sure

100
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:29,919
and in digits its warning in science

101
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,479
does that sound similar to you we

102
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,878
actually found lots of interesting

103
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,039
different patterns in Chinese passwords

104
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,530
and English passwords so in the

105
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,080
following I want to give you an overview

106
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,068
about the characteristics of Chinese

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,198
passwords to have a systematic

108
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:50,080
comparison we study the letter

109
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,150
distribution the semantic patterns the

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,068
length distribution and frequency

111
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,919
distribution of Chinese and English

112
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:59,110
passwords we found that the letter

113
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,758
distribution and semantically super

114
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,279
patterns are very different

115
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,529
well the length distribution and

116
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,860
frequent distribution are actually

117
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:13,060
similar to save time we only showcase

118
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,430
two examples first for the top three

119
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,240
structural patterns it's quite obvious

120
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,699
that most of Chinese users actually use

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,190
passwords created by all digits actually

122
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,240
over 50 percent of Chinese passwords are

123
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,849
all digits

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,180
we'll for English passwords only 10% of

125
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:32,969
them are created from purely digits for

126
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,120
English passwords the most popular

127
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:40,690
patterns are all created by letters of

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,419
course this is only a simple analysis of

129
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,639
the structural patterns to folder have a

130
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,469
deeper understanding about semantic

131
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,200
patterns

132
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,210
the passwords we constructed 22

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,360
dictionaries of different semantic

134
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,840
categories so this 17 categories include

135
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,620
English names Chinese pin names and also

136
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,229
dates phone numbers and I just want to

137
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,770
showcase the little bit of the our

138
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,500
results so the solid blocks on the left

139
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,659
side are Chinese passwords and the right

140
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,750
sides are English passwords it's quite

141
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,700
obvious that Chinese users do not really

142
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,670
use English names when they create

143
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,250
passwords and turns out to use lots of

144
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:26,370
Chinese pinyin names in their passwords

145
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,070
we also found Chinese users are more

146
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:33,270
likely to use phone numbers and dates in

147
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:35,280
their passwords although we can see that

148
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,590
the Chinese passwords are an English

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,619
passwords are so different they still

150
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,380
have some similar features such wise the

151
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,570
length distribution of the passwords you

152
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,370
can probably say from the figure most of

153
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,419
the training passwords and English

154
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,730
passwords they fall into the range of

155
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:58,620
length through 5 to 10 and the most

156
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:01,080
popular ones are 6 and 8 so now we

157
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,840
understand the similarities and

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,650
differences of Chinese and English

159
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,619
passwords

160
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,599
we won't answer the next question how to

161
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,479
measure the strength of Chinese

162
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,910
passwords and a Chinese passwords

163
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:19,650
stronger or weaker than English

164
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:22,020
passwords interestingly previous two

165
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,820
papers on this one attribute for

166
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,760
contradictory results on Chinese

167
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,120
passwords dreams who newspaper and

168
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,729
Oakland toñito says Chinese passwords

169
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,880
are the hardest - gasps well leaves

170
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,950
paper and use Nate 2014 says that the

171
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,880
strength of Chinese passwords in an

172
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,890
English passwords is similar so to have

173
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,170
a systematic understanding about the

174
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:50,040
string style Chinese passwords within

175
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,319
the following experiments first we

176
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,420
choose to state-of-art password cracking

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,820
algorithms

178
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,229
pcfg based cracking and knock off base

179
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,300
cracking

180
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,150
and for the training data set for

181
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,699
Chinese websites we use 4 million

182
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,449
Chinese passwords from dorwan website

183
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:13,050
and for English password we use for

184
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:16,770
meaning English passwords from Roku

185
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:19,199
website and to have a fair comparison

186
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,199
between the password reinstall Chinese

187
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,990
and English we pair the passwords by the

188
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,690
service tab this is because previous

189
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,140
study shows that users tend to create

190
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:34,170
passwords based on the importance of the

191
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,350
accounts therefore repair Kenya with

192
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,219
rock you both of them are Social Forum

193
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,880
forums and we've heard o'neill with

194
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:47,070
Yahoo both of them are portals with

195
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,740
e-commerce functionalities and with

196
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:53,630
Perseus dealing with PHP BB both of them

197
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,240
are developer forums and we're studying

198
00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:00,810
the password working techniques we found

199
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,110
that PHP has one limitation so the basic

200
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,510
idea of pcfg is to pass the passwords in

201
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,270
two different components such as letter

202
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,670
segment digit segment and symbol segment

203
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,819
and then calculate the probability of

204
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,130
the password by the structure so that

205
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,270
you can use the probability to create

206
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,189
cracking passwords well when we studied

207
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,860
Chinese passwords we found Chinese

208
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:29,880
passwords including many interleaving

209
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,680
patterns for example 1 and 1 D 1 G might

210
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,200
probably make no sense for most of

211
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,250
English speakers but this is actually a

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,500
password translated from Chinese poem so

213
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,640
as actually makes sense in Chinese to

214
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,130
have such password as a result pcfg

215
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,199
algorithms overlook the relationship

216
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,350
between the letter segments and digits

217
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,510
Amand takes them as all independent so

218
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,520
therefore they underestimates the

219
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,689
probability of this interleaving

220
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:03,180
patterns to improve pcfg

221
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,790
we propose to do interleaving conversion

222
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,859
which means we'll transfer the interim

223
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,959
passwords into normal passwords to

224
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,370
calculate a probability during training

225
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,220
phase we

226
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,950
suppose to do in full improvement by

227
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,220
IDing paintings and adding days into

228
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,680
pcfg the reason is that previously were

229
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,040
a show that Chinese users tends more

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,339
likely to use pin names and dates when

231
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:34,199
they create passwords we found that it

232
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:36,089
did improve pcfg by around 1.7 to 4.3

233
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,700
improvements on different data sets and

234
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,850
the way found interleaving commercial

235
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,630
and IDP names are helpful well adding

236
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:49,200
days is now that helpful and with

237
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,800
improved PC up to you cracking we

238
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,050
identified a very interesting phenomenon

239
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,050
so we found that when the test number is

240
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,870
small the Chinese passwords are weaker

241
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,270
than English passwords but when the

242
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,880
guessing number is large the Chinese

243
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,400
passwords are stronger than the English

244
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,490
passwords you can see the two figures

245
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,800
the life side is about cracking Chinese

246
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,589
passwords and the right side is about

247
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,709
cracking English passwords the X

248
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:22,410
represents the number of guessing and

249
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,930
rying represents the percentage of

250
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,140
passwords getting cracked so the higher

251
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,779
the Y value the weaker the password you

252
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,029
can tell from the beginning the Chinese

253
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,910
passwords is actually weaker than

254
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,510
English passwords but in the end on the

255
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,240
right side the English password is

256
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,360
weaker than Chinese passwords this is

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,400
not just limited to pcfg we also found

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,690
similar patterns with knockoff based

259
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,360
cracking so to summarize our conclusion

260
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,880
for the strength of Chinese password we

261
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,120
found this by facial security nature of

262
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,150
Chinese passwords which means when the

263
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,440
guessing number is small such as online

264
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,600
casting scenarios

265
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,089
Chinese passwords are weaker than

266
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,250
English passwords but when the casting

267
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,950
number is large star trials for the

268
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,930
Oakland casting scenarios Chinese

269
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,440
passwords are stronger than their

270
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,030
English counterparts

271
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,610
ok now we have a better understanding

272
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,920
about Chinese passwords

273
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,410
we also have some implication insights

274
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,189
hopefully to be helpful for us to design

275
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:35,010
better password security schemes first

276
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,080
for password creation policy will show

277
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,510
that Chinese passwords are more

278
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,510
vulnerable to online guessing attacks as

279
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,370
a result we suggest that for the

280
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,189
password policy all Chinese websites

281
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,130
will have a moderate size our blacklist

282
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,950
and also we should have good passwords

283
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,740
dreams meters and speaking about

284
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,610
passwords transmitters we found that

285
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:03,030
many factors are important for selecting

286
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,820
the best training set for example the

287
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,939
language is a bigger factor than the

288
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,060
size of its tab and such service tab is

289
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,540
a bigger factor than the password policy

290
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,660
and the color your training set to the

291
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,880
target passwords the better so this

292
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,949
suggests that there's no single training

293
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,230
set that can face all the passwords

294
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:29,010
transmitters you should really consider

295
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:32,120
the different features of the service to

296
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:35,160
actually choose the best training sets

297
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,630
ok and also for password cracking you

298
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,640
should also follow a similar crime

299
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,130
occurred to us and also we have some

300
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,420
insights about the two the difference of

301
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:47,850
the pcfg and malkov based cracking to

302
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,610
summarize we should study passwords from

303
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,530
different cultures because the passwords

304
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,410
from different languages are so

305
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,120
different we need to improve our tools

306
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,390
and get better understanding about

307
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,090
passwords in other languages and another

308
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,800
interesting future work is that to

309
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,290
investigate the Chinese password

310
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,719
behaviors through user surveys how do

311
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,280
they create password how do they manage

312
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,500
the passwords with that I want to give a

313
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,360
shout-out to my causers who can now be

314
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,620
here today and feel free to ask

315
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,720
questions and in the end well you are

316
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,060
asking me questions I also give you some

317
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,280
interesting questions to think about

318
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,319
so this is some interesting password

319
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,860
from Xia Tian wishes the dua of her

320
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,650
website

321
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,529
so this Chinese developers are using

322
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,050
Chinese poems

323
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,540
to create these passwords so can you

324
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,029
guess I'll show you what does this means

325
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,129
don't worry if you are not a Chinese

326
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,160
speaker you can probably search on

327
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:51,829
Google to get some of these answers so I

328
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,519
can also give you some hint so with that

329
00:15:51,829 --> 00:16:03,589
I'm happy to answer the questions okay

330
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:06,980
thanks everyone for your time thank you

331
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,720
very much I invite speakers to come up

332
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,480
to ask questions please introduce

333
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,139
yourself and name an affiliation and ask

334
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,670
away

335
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:19,040
hi I'm such a go from Engel you I was

336
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,930
wondering if in your digging through the

337
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,029
data sets were you able to find keyboard

338
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:27,319
patterns that are often common in

339
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:29,720
English datasets and which are they yes

340
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,149
like for example some of the English

341
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,709
passwords also English password and

342
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,839
training passwords they also sharing

343
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,599
some log key word patterns maybe you are

344
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,089
talking about this kind of one cue a day

345
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,269
and two WS exact this can all patterns

346
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,389
yeah we saw them in post in both website

347
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,879
in both can all categories but the most

348
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,550
common creations for the Chinese

349
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:56,230
password still made majority as digits

350
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,229
yeah okay thanks thank you

351
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,420
I'm Jeffrey Goldberg from 1password

352
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,510
thank you very much for this this is I

353
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,770
can't really nice to see this work I'm

354
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:12,890
wondering if this if you're finding that

355
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,780
the Chinese ones are easier to crack for

356
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,770
the small number of guesses harder for

357
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:22,069
the longer if this is just a relatively

358
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,750
simple parameter in the distribution of

359
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,178
passwords I don't know if you're

360
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:30,559
familiar with David

361
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:32,690
Malone's work on password distributions

362
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,299
but if you were to sort of plot this out

363
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,820
on a log scale you might just be that

364
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,309
the slopes a little different yeah I

365
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,649
said that might be a good point myself

366
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:46,490
about why Chinese passwords are wake her

367
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:48,469
when like for online guessing scenario

368
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,850
is that most all training passwords they

369
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,880
are created by the

370
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:56,120
so usually four digits is very easy to

371
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,460
follow into some patterns so this might

372
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,310
be some of the hidden reasons why it's

373
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,440
actually it's actually easier to crack

374
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,720
for the online guessing but you can have

375
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,110
very complex patterns just like this

376
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,110
ones so yeah now I want to give you the

377
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:15,290
answer so there are actually all famous

378
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,429
poems in Chinese so I'm sorry for my bad

379
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,350
translation they're actually very

380
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,150
beautiful poems and there are real

381
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,969
passwords from the leakage of a

382
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:30,690
developer web form so thank you everyone

383
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,690
[Applause]
