1
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,669
hello everyone my name is Wang drew the

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,009
first author with this paper

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,230
I'm from Institute of computing

4
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:21,930
technology this walk was collaborated

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,329
with Ohio State University in East Sudan

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,820
University Purdue USA and kept the

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,950
Normal University the title of this

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,020
paper is safe hidden an efficient and

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,860
secure information hiding technique

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:38,030
using real randomization ok what's

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,030
information hiding hiding technique

12
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,800
information information hiding technique

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,039
is that in for precise memory isolation

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,318
it's a hit an important area we call it

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,109
a city error at a random location and

16
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:53,850
the interviews for that there is no

17
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:56,909
pointers in the regular memory points to

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,370
this area that is mean that attackers do

19
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,670
not to leak the pointers to find the

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,250
location of a severe and the severely

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,570
design as small as possible to ensure

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,060
the very high for elimination entropy

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,690
no more exercises are done so outside

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,940
from a dedicated register this technique

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:22,350
is widely used today in color real cheap

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:25,679
senses such as CFI CPI and cool eerie

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,399
randomization but recently H is no

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,670
Sakura anymore there are many attacks

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,690
had proposed the tool proposed against

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,330
the information hiding we classify these

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:42,750
attacks the into three types the first

32
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:46,289
attempt was memorable memory scanning

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,680
avoided the crash this this slide gives

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,870
the user memory space and there is the

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,180
city era hitting is a very large iMac

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,330
the area and the base address is stored

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,100
into the GS a community segmentation

38
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:04,320
register attacker want to locate severe

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:08,340
so the user one ability to scanning on

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,700
the memory to find the location of a

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,060
city era during memory scanning it will

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,459
problem many and map the area that could

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,910
could across for the trigger the program

44
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,770
crash so there are many work there are

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,329
two words

46
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,070
proposal to avoid across

47
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,530
the first day is the therapy attack in

48
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,019
the uses the exception handling Magnum

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,180
in JavaScript the engine to avoid the

50
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,830
cross the stagger is a club for being

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,810
attacked in the problem child

52
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:42,090
personality do to avoid the cross the

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,960
parent process such as the web servers

54
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,080
the attacker problems the worker process

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,510
if the worker process is quest the demon

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,240
per sensible folks the channel the

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,459
process and is the me and the memory

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,740
layout which how the process is the same

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,050
is the theme to the pairing of quirk

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:06,750
precise ok the segment have a second

61
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,980
type of attacks are reducing the entropy

62
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:15,510
of a city error they are also to work to

63
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:19,609
again at work attack h the first of our

64
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,769
is fielding purely American city errors

65
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,459
when working funds that when were

66
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,950
founded some city era are implemented

67
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,830
strike as a local such as shadow stark

68
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,730
and stiff stack so liquid of supremes

69
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:39,180
stress and then serene many three local

70
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,780
security into the memory the second is

71
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,260
the feeling the memory hosts they are

72
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,730
located that they are located the memory

73
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,910
repeatedly to occupy the I mapped error

74
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,070
so the success success success the

75
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:58,350
probability of a problem the severa is

76
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:02,820
increased the last awhile is a NCH an

77
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:05,690
attack against our h we knew that the

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,540
normal sense to to see Fiero at time

79
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,090
dance or all the war charges the

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,030
hardware should perform that address

81
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,829
translation from water charges to the

82
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,108
physical dress by working or page table

83
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:25,590
there are a full level for this full

84
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,990
level page tables there are full pts

85
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,940
very imperative of working these for

86
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,789
pity's will be loaded into the last

87
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,460
level cache so that attacker could

88
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,950
perform the catch please search an

89
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,820
analysis to infer the low key

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:47,099
PT's and finally finds the location of a

91
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,349
safety error so I have revealed all the

92
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,990
attacks against the information hiding

93
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:56,310
like the next of a week will gave the

94
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:59,630
Strand model of our work we consider and

95
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,860
HBase the defenses that protest

96
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,200
vulnerable application against the color

97
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,200
wheel that has structured web servers or

98
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,690
brothers the design of this yhps the

99
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,000
defense is not flawed before lunch in

100
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,310
CUDA real detects attackers and master

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,940
compromised the defense by review the

102
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,470
severus attacker has three abilities

103
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,350
firstly they write arbitrary memory

104
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,750
locations the second is located under

105
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:29,310
free arbitrary memory areas last thought

106
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:32,070
is created any number of strides we

107
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,310
reviewed all known attacks and the

108
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,349
summary into full attack vectors vector

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,390
one gathering memory layout of the

110
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,630
information to have two located severe

111
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,550
we know that the RVM memories gaining

112
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,400
the attacker one needs to know the

113
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,310
probability is mapped or not if it is

114
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,440
mapped through the charge if the mapped

115
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:58,800
area is secured or other dinner area or

116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,900
Okuda area the second vector is creating

117
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,110
opportunity to problem without questions

118
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,780
of system the third is reducing the

119
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,030
entropy of the relevant severe

120
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,090
allocations the last day the monitoring

121
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,309
page tebow access patterns using textile

122
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,239
channels

123
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:20,730
ok the nest ID will give our design

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,250
Steve hidden Savita is a proposal to

125
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,220
block all these attack vectors the

126
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,400
Interceptor all types of problems that

127
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,100
may leak the locations of severe the

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,849
randomized severe with upon detecting

129
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,950
special props isolating the three local

130
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,770
severus and the reasoning security

131
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,760
alarms the illegal probes are problems

132
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:48,150
that are detected ok let's see how to

133
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,310
hidden block these attack vectors to

134
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,340
block of vector while severe the

135
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,530
intercepts the

136
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,450
all the events that may be triggered by

137
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,669
the attackers for some was some memory

138
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,420
management system of course such as I'm

139
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:07,030
a protector and be our key a technical

140
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,030
assistance Marco - scanning the memory

141
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,919
of feeling the memory host stagnated

142
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,900
some call that couldn't return you for

143
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,670
the value it eluded your system are

144
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,609
called to scanning the memory without

145
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,240
the cross the system started coloring

146
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,880
polluting memory space Laster is memory

147
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,680
access instructions to be hidden didn't

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,230
to use human all memory access

149
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,680
instructions because no more accessories

150
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,770
functions only access the map the area

151
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,190
that is the cool area and in the data

152
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,340
area but this memory access instructions

153
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,100
used real depay attackers could maybe

154
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,409
access the unwrapped area the are real

155
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,510
memories getting so severe only

156
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,720
intercepts the pill for deception is a

157
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,900
map a map the area left the particles

158
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:04,250
the give the picture of how they've

159
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:09,140
hidden blockade there

160
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,910
oh I'm sorry the Orion memory scanning

161
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:15,349
we assumed hidden will randomize the

162
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:17,420
safety area at the location and that we

163
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,330
know that the read randomization only

164
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,970
increase the 1peter radamenes so the

165
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,599
persistent attacks could have a the

166
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:31,640
succeed that's the vector to we need to

167
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:35,690
block to block vector tools they've

168
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,179
hidden live live traps they were trapped

169
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,599
at the original location of a city Aras

170
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:44,689
after randomizing the simulated City era

171
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,150
the city are the are real memories

172
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,930
gaining the Tiffany will creates my name

173
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:53,900
is Travis and the attacker will be he

174
00:08:50,930 --> 00:09:01,699
may be captured by the tribalism more

175
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:04,540
likely the third is reducing the entropy

176
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,740
of the randomizer city our locations

177
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,189
civilian prevents are limited the

178
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,350
strength of our map to areas and

179
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:15,170
restricted the growth of severus the

180
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:19,310
maximum says oh the mapped area is said

181
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:22,459
to 640 B which is half of the user

182
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,829
memory space stagnant India days

183
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,800
straight probably the memory met them to

184
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,170
isolated try the local Severus the

185
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,130
entropy will not be reduced the best

186
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,260
trance Ryan

187
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,570
this will be called attackers cannot

188
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,630
access the others tried to try local

189
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,089
city hours in Vance tried in

190
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,700
particularly use hardware-assisted

191
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,310
virtualization technique that is East

192
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,490
Indian vegetable to achieve this Maxim

193
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,410
all threads will share the same pitch he

194
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,280
bows by the interest rate will be as

195
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:58,540
done as tribe travel apt but the multi

196
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,720
Hills about this mechanism Iowa people

197
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,360
the last vector is the state channels we

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,180
have a to money to observations about

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,750
this attack they need hundreds on pre

200
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,739
improv or Eevee system tests it's also

201
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,510
imperative that the addresses of the PD

202
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,870
is the corresponding to this memory

203
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,750
are not changed that during tests that

204
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,000
is to say the cache entry is merited by

205
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,720
these P DS arnott the change of the tool

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,850
so the solution is the same we use the

207
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,279
revalidation

208
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,769
simulator also monitors legal access to

209
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,810
the city era that may be triggered by

210
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:43,459
the attacker on purpose

211
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,109
once such legal access is detected the

212
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,989
same hidden will randomize the location

213
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,230
over the city era but how to detect this

214
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,370
legal access from the attacker is the

215
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,199
problem the key step Oh catch a side

216
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,410
channel attack against the page table is

217
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:03,469
to force a pitiable walk we knew that if

218
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,510
TR be hit that virtual address will be

219
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,779
translated to the federal judge directly

220
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:12,290
so the tiger must trigger the therapy

221
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:16,660
miss miss so we could intercept the TR v

222
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,399
mrs. to intercept the portable probing

223
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,980
but how to only intercept the Derby miss

224
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,250
occurred in Saphira is a problem we know

225
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,010
that in hell provides p.m. you to sample

226
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:32,480
the term misses but it is not accuracy

227
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:36,680
and only sample the whole hold process

228
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,870
the process is TR b misses our solution

229
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,989
is converted here beam is too pitiful

230
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:46,699
exception by using the architectural

231
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:49,569
support they are this is a Pte format

232
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,889
there are a full beat our reserve bid

233
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:53,750
wins that with their beat instead a

234
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:57,290
pitiful the exception will be triggered

235
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:59,990
during the pitiable work sim hidden says

236
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:04,219
that with Derby tini all the PD is for

237
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,029
the ctrl to detect the Derby misses well

238
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,100
er be missed

239
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:11,389
occurs is the trapped into the pitiful

240
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:14,480
handler okay let's give the flowchart

241
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:16,339
our pitiful handler if TR be hated

242
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,920
virtual address will be translated to

243
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,440
the translator to the physical address

244
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,990
directly if TR be missed

245
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,449
Holly we will perform a stable walking

246
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,370
and the portable triggering pin for the

247
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:30,529
inception and the Steve Hayden intercept

248
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,430
its inception and

249
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:36,620
check if if their piece of the

250
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,689
corresponding PD is a sense or not if

251
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,300
they it is the not static it will

252
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:43,849
deliver the control flow to the original

253
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,399
P default handler if the if it is sighs

254
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,540
it means that this exception is the fake

255
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,459
pitiful deception we needed to handle

256
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,199
first the way we are clean all secures

257
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:59,029
the reserved bits and the randomize the

258
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:02,269
perform while wrong the randomization of

259
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:04,879
severe and then Prioleau that the PD of

260
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:08,509
water address into TR b and the

261
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:11,149
standards are bit what the reservists in

262
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:13,100
all of the police and they relocated the

263
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,009
photograph to the new address as a

264
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,519
return to the user but there are two

265
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:21,949
problems here first is how to Prioleau

266
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,129
the PT into TR b under the key BTR

267
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:26,660
technique we know that to mitigate

268
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:29,990
mounted an attack linear kernel

269
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,420
integrated the TBI technique it displays

270
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,459
the page table into kernel mode the page

271
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,829
table and as you the more the page table

272
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,660
I must've hidden because I was hidden

273
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,399
needs to intercept the system a call and

274
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,319
the pitiful exception so simply has

275
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,170
semihidden is Matty into the column of

276
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:47,420
the page table and and it needs to

277
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,759
preload the UNAM of the page table PT

278
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,839
into t RB they are we in Congress which

279
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:57,019
is available animal flushes that shall

280
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,410
be how to pray low that the user more

281
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:03,559
the PT e in the TLB is a problem a

282
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,680
second aid is it could cost many false

283
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,870
alarm TR be misses at a new location we

284
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,489
knew that the year this flowchart they

285
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,379
are at any time there is only one PDE o

286
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,220
city are loaded into the theory that

287
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:22,250
break the access and locality of Saphira

288
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,399
the and Inc has very high performance

289
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,149
overhead we needed to handle this more

290
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:33,339
birthdays are detailed in Java people

291
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:35,540
okay let's see the system implementation

292
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,329
civilian design at the loadable kernel

293
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,209
module we interpreted as the advisor for

294
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:43,170
Nahuatl at the OS it was realized is the

295
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,300
running OS as the guest with the other

296
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,160
rebooting the system the other company

297
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,680
is called Casa key I'm ready in Casa

298
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,139
Colonel this is the architect of

299
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,290

300
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,570

system of calls and pitiful inception

303
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:05,609
and the check if irritated the need

304
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:09,149
perform the randomization or regional

305
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,410

the kernel module Razer security Allah

315
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,639
okay let's give a performance evaluation

316
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,589
Sevilla is implemented as a stasis fall

317
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,019
in its platform

318
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:48,570
citizen protest two devices that the you

319
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,660
Dean RH that here's the shadow stag and

320
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:56,519
all CFR and the GS segmentation register

321
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:59,790
is the user to point to the Sofia wait

322
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,699
chose three halves benchmarks to

323
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,760
evaluate why is the CPU in history

324
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:08,339
benchmarks such as spike and the PASOK

325
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,449
the second is the network I open to mark

326

330
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,470
sieve hidden falls back severe they

331
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,260

332
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,329
less than three percent performance over

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,120
percent performance overhead when

336
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,149
protecting Asafa and the shadow stack

337
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,310
the reason why some hidden incurred more

338
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:50,040
being heard of higher performance

339
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:52,260
overhead by in what is rightly the

340
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,410
benchmarks that is because civilian

341
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,790
needs to maintain the EB T's to isolated

342
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,719
just rather low cost if you are

343
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:06,500
the second is the network i/o benchmark

344
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:11,179
for a hockey civilian heard around the

345
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,640
12% and performance / - over Haider been

346
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:16,640
protecting Osaka and shuttle stack and

347
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:21,220
the full injects the for indiaunheard

348
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:25,760
less than 6 percent performance overhead

349
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:28,549
also the JEM Hadar incurs a very high

350
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,429
the verify the performance of our highly

351
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:35,179
in multi-story the profits which marks

352
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:38,990
the last is a disk i/o benchmark survey

353
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:41,090
the incurs less than sir three percent

354
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,830
performance overhead ok with the

355
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:48,470
conclusion Tim Hayden is the it's a

356
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,730
proposed generalization pays the ihe

357
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,210
technique against the all-knowing

358
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,440
attacks and it introduced the youth or

359
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,650
was right probably the memory to

360
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,419
oscillator loco but the CRS and I

361
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:11,960
devised a new technique to detect

362
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:13,370
Jeremy's thanks and the question so I'll

363
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,320
go ahead and ask one here while they're

364
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:20,149
coming up so I'm curious as to why you

365
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,879
chose these apts rather than let's say

366
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,220
just unmask and creat multiple address

367
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,309
spaces for further each thread for the

368
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,290
thread local area wouldn't like the kpti

369
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,629
already kind of hide the cost because

370
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,120
you're already having to switch do you

371
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,030
mean by way you'll hardware what

372
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,428
tradition technique yeah instead of just

373
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,940
separate address spaces at the dude this

374
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:47,660
is two to one to compete for with with

375
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,970
Linux kernel because we are another way

376
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,330
to implement throughout Travie the

377
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,910
maximum service very the memory Maxima

378
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,418
is to use the East rather than a page

379
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:01,790
table but the Scipio walk men Holloway

380
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:04,210
are walking the PCT by the way all

381
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:08,409
starts the reserved it will set the

382
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,990
access PT and under 30 bits but

383
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:14,230
sacrificing all these speeds

384
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:18,070
in one pizza boy is the problem okay so

385
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:21,159
yeah our implemented implementations

386
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,750
authorizer you're just you're the wires

387
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,929
page people are normal

388
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,159
okay it makes a lot sense thank you

389
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:30,039
alright John Criswell University of

390
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,779
Rochester so one question I have is a

391
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,669
bit of a higher level question when you

392
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:37,659
have a diversification a random

393
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:39,340
randomization based defense right you

394
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,990
have the issue of an attacker trying to

395
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,850
attack the system over and over and over

396
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,500
again with random guesses right so if

397
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,520
they can't if they can't deduce where

398
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,029
things are at they can just keep

399
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,010
guessing right so which means that at

400
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:53,230
some point they'll get lucky and guess

401
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,539
the correct answer right so my question

402
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,309
is you have this security alert right

403
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,610
that's supposed to stop the attacker

404
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:03,220
right they've been detected but what is

405
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,350
an administrator or system supposed to

406
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,580
do once an attack is detected to make

407
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:11,320
the attack go away do you mean who may

408
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,139
house they've hey then handle the

409
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,720
security alarm well so my question is is

410
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,679
you get a security alarm then what what

411
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,929
are you supposed to do with that

412
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,840
information either the system or the

413
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,929
system administrator even invaded and

414
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:29,260
captured of the attackers it it really

415
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:31,929
is the security alarm but fall for

416
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,840
different so applications sticking area

417
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:37,960
we have different handling for example

418
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,360
for for web servers serve hidden it

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:45,570
could be interpreted into the fair wall

420
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:50,408
to her to forbidden to access that

421
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:52,600
that's a IP for web web servers brother

422
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:56,559
for brother's safe it can be interpreted

423
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,750
in the browser to to forbidden to access

424
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,289
to download that yes called JavaScript

425
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,090
code from that website okay so basically

426
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,270
is an application specific sort of

427
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,490
reaction to the attack yeah yes okay

428
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,070
thanks we'll do one more question from

429
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:15,039
second Mike well our another next

430
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:18,129
speaker comes and gets set up on your

431
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,529
spec benchmarking did you turn off a SLR

432
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,030
and how many iterations of the spec

433
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:26,390
benchmarks did you run

434
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,520
I'm sorry I I can't understand it with

435
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,130
you sir

436
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,920
sorry true Dean Amazon when you did the

437
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:36,550
spec benchmarks did you turn off address

438
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,550
space layout randomization

439
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,970
you mean the so a SLR is typically

440
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:47,179
turned on and did you did you disable it

441
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:51,260
for your evaluation the ARB matthäus

442
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,000
know how to know just a SLR let's go and

443
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,530
take it offline we got to get moving so

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,210
alright let's go ahead and pick our

445
00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:00,039
speaker once again

446
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,039
[Applause]
