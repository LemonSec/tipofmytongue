1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,840
my name is ping WOM I'm from University

2
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,160
of Texas at Allis teen I'm here to

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,590
represent our group

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,189
dr. Alvaro Cardenas from University of

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,550
California Santa Santa Cruz and my

6
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,169
advisor dr. Ross Pollak from UT Austin

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,660
so as the title said in this

8
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:34,750
presentation we're going to look at out

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,510
he the cyber attacks on RT devices but

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,030
from a different perspective we're

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,309
looking into power systems and how does

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,380
this cyber tech impact the operation of

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,750
the system and how the protection design

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,750
in the system defend the system against

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,260
our super tech so cyber attacks in the

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,200
power system existed before it actually

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,610
happened in Ukraine power grid two years

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,670
in a row from 2015 to 2016 caused over a

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:07,630
hundred thousand cars lost their power

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,579
supply for a long time and then there

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,240
are evidence showing the footprint of

22
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:15,279
cyber attackers in the nuclear plants in

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,789
the u.s. and recently

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,079
if you fallen in use between the US

25
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:22,509
government in Russia there's a

26
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:27,130
co-creation of a potential cyber warfare

27
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:29,380
on the power grease so the previous

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,048
power grid attacks are targeting the

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,749
poor power sees in the control center so

30
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:37,179
typically there's a this supervisory

31
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:39,479
control and data acquisition system that

32
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,979
collect the data from the Power Systems

33
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,609
and then the engineer works with the

34
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:47,799
operator inside the control room and

35
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:49,869
then they will send some comments back

36
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,490
to the system to operate the system so

37
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,770
it has become a target to the cyber

38
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,990
attackers then they will try to

39
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,630
illegally get entry to the system and

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,999
then they will launch the denial of

41
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,979
services or try to block the people in

42
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:05,759
the control room and then they can take

43
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:09,190
over the system to whatever they want

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,899
recently we have this discussion about

45
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,720
new type of cyber attacks and the power

46
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,819
system targeting the consumers internet

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,220
machines so Internet of scenes become

48
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,649
popular nowadays people just download

49
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,690
apps and they can control some home

50
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,690
devices with their smartphones

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,549
and then giving the convenience of the

52
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,560
modern life like that they at the same

53
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,900
time exposed many of their devices on

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,480
the internet particularly those one

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,600
consume a lot of energy for example your

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,530
fridge your electric vehicles or ovens

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,799
or water heaters so that can give a

58
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,330
chance that cyber attackers can control

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,760
control them and and if the cyber

60
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,280
attackers can collect a large amount of

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,230
them they can manipulate a significant

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,810
amount on the demand side of the power

63
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,720
systems so this issue has been discussed

64
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,459
in the previous work one of them

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,959
presented here in this conference last

66
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:11,840
year so now the question comes to what

67
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,290
are the impact of the cyber attack on

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,269
the IOT devices to the power systems can

69
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,910
they really bring down the operational

70
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,630
power grid unfortunately from the

71
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,980
previous work the answer seems to be yes

72
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,620
so we think this is a very important

73
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:31,760
issue and we're look into this problem

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,810
and try to do simulations with our - and

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,310
our result it's very different although

76
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,100
we think it's important to pay attention

77
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,959
for such cyberattacks but to bring down

78
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,989
the power grid is not as easy as

79
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,200
previously thought so what are the

80
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:49,970
reasons make our work different result

81
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,640
different ways the previous work

82
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,920
so we grouped them into two categories

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,540
so first the way we model the

84
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,170
protections in the power system are

85
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,820
different and then secondly we operate

86
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,410
the simulation different due to the time

87
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,209
limit we're going to focus on the

88
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,959
protections of the power system in this

89
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:12,319
presentation so the outline of the rest

90
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,989
of presentation goes as follows we're

91
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,390
going in first to discuss the impacts of

92
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,870
modality attack in details on the power

93
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,520
system and then we're going to show what

94
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,770
is protections in the power system and

95
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,750
how does they work and in the end we'll

96
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,650
show two different case studies to

97
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,820
demonstrate the operation of protection

98
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,890
and the correlation of simulations

99
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,200
so once the cyber attackers compromised

100
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,469
the demand one thing they can do is to

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,140
increase the demand so then some power

102
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,420
plant have to increase their output to

103
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,729
supply that extra demand in the system

104
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,530
so what is dangerous

105
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,200
some of the transmission line may get

106
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,250
overloaded and then there's a chance

107
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,590
that they make it be they are taken out

108
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,970
so we're going to discuss the detail of

109
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,530
protections on the transmission line

110
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,050
later in this presentation

111
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,390
but at this point we just have to know

112
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,860
if the line is severely overloaded

113
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,590
there's a chance that the line will be

114
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,480
taken out and then the power flow you

115
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,520
used to flow on that transmission line

116
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,350
now goes to the neighbor transmission

117
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,539
line and then increase the burden of

118
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,390
those lines and then impose the same

119
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,000
danger to those lines and then this kind

120
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,710
of a cascading outages can spread into

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,220
the system potentially can lead to a

122
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,500
blackout so that's one part of the

123
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,350
impact that Mariotti tech can put on the

124
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,170
system the other impact from the

125
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,530
morality attack is they can cause the

126
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,660
energy imbalance in the Power Systems so

127
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,179
in the next few slides we're going to

128
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,510
show what is the energy balance in the

129
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,920
power system and why is that important

130
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,539
so the bottom line in the power system

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,060
is to store electricity in long term in

132
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,450
large-scale are still not economically

133
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,550
efficient yet so what does that mean is

134
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,800
we have to match the demand with the

135
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:12,680
generation in real time in the operation

136
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,680
so in the middle waist in a modern power

137
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,890
system we have these large generators

138
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,030
then they have those rotating mass

139
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,550
inside the unit

140
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,739
carrying the magnetic field that's the

141
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,890
way they convert the kinetic energy into

142
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,690
the electricity so those masks are

143
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,390
rotating mass they are electrically

144
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,920
coupled and they can provide some

145
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,620
inertia to the system what does that

146
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,620
mean so when you go back home and turn

147
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,540
on your light or your AC no one tells

148
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,760
you when to do that right so it's

149
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,630
unexpected by the generators they cannot

150
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:51,469
increase their output instantly to

151
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:54,469
so before they come in and react those

152
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,630
rotating mass inside the generator will

153
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,430
reduce their speed a little bit so that

154
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,980
they convert that a little bit of

155
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,220
kinetic energy to the system to supply

156
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,980
that electricity demand so now you can

157
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,960
understand how the cybertek can

158
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,970
pudding-like cause the energy imbalance

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,940
in the system they will increase the

160
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,460
demand and then suddenly we have more

161
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,219
demand than generation in the system so

162
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,500
a lot of those rotating generators will

163
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,050
start to slow down and then you can sync

164
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,030
system frequency as a representative of

165
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,860
the average speed of all the units in

166
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,929
the system so the system frequency will

167
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,470
start to decline so while it's not a

168
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,110
passing system all the generators cannot

169
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,090
they cannot operate at any frequency so

170
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,500
they have a safe range range of

171
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,020
frequency that they can operate

172
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,490
otherwise they might have permanent

173
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,909
damages and they're very expensive

174
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,150
devices so what they do in in this

175
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,160
condition is if the frequency goes out

176
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,469
of the limit they may take out their

177
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,090
generator from the system but that's a

178
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,420
horrible thing to do at this moment

179
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,310
because on one hand we have this actual

180
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,590
demand around the system and on the

181
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,510
other hand we're losing generators so

182
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,229
the result is the energy balance are

183
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,849
getting worse and then eventually the

184
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,010
frequency would you climb faster and

185
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,930
we're losing more generators so there's

186
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,200
a danger that we may have a system

187
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,440
collapse and lead to a blackout so next

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,870
let me introduce the protections and

189
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,730
true to have some discussion how the

190
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,890
protections are designed to prevent such

191
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,960
consequences so I would like to divide

192
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,630
the system protections into two group

193
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,060
their protections designed to protect

194
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,500
the local components like the one we

195
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,449
mentioned in the generator they don't

196
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,540
allow their unit to operate outside of

197
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,850
the safety range of the frequency so

198
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,550
they would disconnect their unit from

199
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,280
the system and there are other type of

200
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:55,640
strategy design in the system to protect

201
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,910
the system at all from failure so they

202
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,350
apply this so-called m- one criteria

203
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,110
that is commonly a

204
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,540
right to the all the power system I mean

205
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,120
almost most of the power system will

206
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,160
cause the word meaning taking our 1 out

207
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,460
of n components in the system shouldn't

208
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,400
lead the season to a large failure or

209
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:20,630
losing power supply to customers in

210
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,939
large area so we're going to talk to a

211
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,280
different type of protection seen in the

212
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,020
rest of this presentation but before we

213
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,000
go to the result I would like to briefly

214
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,850
introduce these cascading outage

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,780
analysis to that we have been developing

216
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,780
for different generations in our lab so

217
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,360
we designed these to to study the power

218
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,939
system reactions to the large-scale

219
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,820
disruptions so we model different type

220
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,590
of protection schemes including the two

221
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,530
we mentioned in the previous slides and

222
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,540
we study the system dynamics and we

223
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,250
represent the power flow on the system

224
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,589
so if you were interested please check

225
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,940
out any of the publications we have

226
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:05,450
about this model so now let's move into

227
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,570
a small case study so for this small

228
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,850
system we have several small generators

229
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,460
and then several demand and there's a

230
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,040
small transmission system to connect the

231
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,140
generator to the demand and now separate

232
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,599
air comes in and then they control the

233
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,390
demand increase the demand by 15% and

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,300
then we spot one transmission line get

235
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,980
overloaded so now is the time to clarify

236
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,560
what is overload me

237
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,440
so once the transmission line get

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,060
overloaded there are actual power flow

239
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,790
on the transmission and then what they

240
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,069
design for so what happens they will

241
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,480
generate more heat along the

242
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,730
transmission line so the transmission

243
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,740
line will start to stacking and the

244
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,440
second itself is now dangerous what is

245
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,380
dangerous if it is set too much there's

246
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,960
a chance that may attach to the ground

247
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,390
object like the tree branches and caused

248
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,210
short-circuit thought that something

249
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,580
operator should prevent for so normally

250
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,190
operators will allow some margin for the

251
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,960
transmission line to go overload so I

252
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,090
think the takeaway from this slide is

253
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,800
the overload of transmission line

254
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,710
doesn't mean we have to take how the

255
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,300
transmission line immediately so what we

256
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,160
model is

257
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,500
we have this time inverse protection

258
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,410
schemes giving the magnitude of the

259
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,600
overload there's a time index return

260
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,279
telling us how long should we wait until

261
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,250
we take out that transmission line from

262
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,160
the system so now let's take a look at

263
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,200
the frequency footprint of this modality

264
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,740
load increased attack in this small

265
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,830
system so the modality load increase by

266
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,140
a 15% a second one and if you remember

267
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,570
10 slides ago we're talking about the

268
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,360
energy imbalance so we have more demand

269
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,520
than generation in the system so those

270
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,820
unit has to be slowed down to supply the

271
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,790
demand the frequency start to drop and

272
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,459
then we have this under frequency low

273
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,800
shedding strategy to protect the system

274
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,449
under frequency low shedding is designed

275
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,760
for the case when the frequency goes

276
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,950
down frequency goes down because we have

277
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,870
more demands than the generation in the

278
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,330
system so they make sense for the system

279
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,810
operator to deliberate disconnect some

280
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,520
unload to repeat the energy balance and

281
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,149
then they would bring back those

282
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,949
disconnect the load gradually later

283
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:24,380
so after - under frequency load shedding

284
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,899
in total 15 percent of system load are

285
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,050
reduced or disconnected and then

286
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:33,140
cysteine-rich to a new balance and then

287
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,290
the frequency goes stable and because of

288
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,510
that countermeasures the power flow

289
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,910
inside the system are changed so the

290
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:44,209
previously overloaded transmission line

291
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,209
right now is relieved and now we can

292
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:51,979
look at the case study in a large power

293
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:55,189
system so we take this case with over

294
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,570
5,000 buses and where I want to mention

295
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,060
that although we're trying to

296
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,800
approximate how the power system react

297
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,770
to large disruptions using the

298
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,859
protection schemes but we do not intend

299
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:10,670
to replicate the protections in the real

300
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,620
system because it's the impossible thing

301
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,719
to do and also it's not as the code to

302
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:20,540
do we have a bunch of assumptions so IOT

303
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,920
attacks they will take full control of

304
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,480
the demand they increase and decrease

305
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,800
the demand simultaneously and also the

306
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
portion of demand compromise

307
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,959
are evenly distributed in the system so

308
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,709
what if we increase the system low by

309
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,810
one percent then we look at the

310
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:41,268
frequency on the left we can see the

311
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,310
frequency goes down but if you look at

312
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,950
the number it doesn't go down that much

313
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,170
and then the system will remain stable

314
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,899
afterwards the power flow on the right

315
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,660
hand side doesn't change that much so

316
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:57,350
that gave us a result different than the

317
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,860
previous previous conclusion which lead

318
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,380
to a large-scale cascading so if we

319
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,899
scale up the attack to ten percent of

320
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,899
system load now we find out the

321
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,640
frequency go down to the level that some

322
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,010
of the under frequency loss reading will

323
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,720
take action and disconnect some load and

324
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,120
the power flow on the right hand side

325
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,610
increase because of the load attack and

326
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,850
then woody Christy came after an African

327
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:25,700
solution we have more results I am

328
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,880
included in our paper but due to the

329
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,560
time limit we have to stop here and make

330
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,760
a conclusion so from the previous work

331
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,439
they did a very interesting work about

332
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,689
modality attack on the power system

333
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,510
described is a type picture of the

334
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,550
security of the power grid with the

335
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,089
frequency instability and cascading line

336
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:49,160
failures so we think the negative impact

337
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,260
of modality attacking the power system

338
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,560
for sure is important and should be paid

339
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:58,060
attention but for now it seems not as

340
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,410
die as origin they thought and there too

341
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,689
although we're a little bit optimistic

342
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,660
at the point about the current system

343
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,660
against the IOT cyberattack but there do

344
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,000
have some challenges in the future so

345
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:14,199
power system have been modernized in the

346
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,920
past decade or two decades a lot we're

347
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,130
integrating more and more renewable

348
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,770
generations so the renewable generations

349
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,449
are different with the traditional steam

350
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,970
generator for example they don't have

351
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,740
those large routine team mass which

352
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,600
means they don't provide inertia to the

353
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,060
system so what does that mean that is

354
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,020
the frequency will change faster than

355
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,819
the original system and then we have on

356
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,180
the demand side we have more distributed

357
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,890
energy resources for example

358
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,410
California will have a lot of rooftop

359
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,300
solar and those are what we call behind

360
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,329
meter meaning they are not visible to

361
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,060
the operators so makes a gave us

362
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,530
challenges to the operation already so

363
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,739
right now we have a more active

364
00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:01,160
consumers there are a lot of options to

365
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,570
consume the electricity and also for

366
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,969
example they are having more and more

367
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,980
electric vehicles so once they want to

368
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,880
point out about the attack is we assume

369
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,860
the tax only in demand so given the past

370
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,680
experience in you Korean power system

371
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,610
maybe it is hard to break into the SCADA

372
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,680
system itself but compromise a system

373
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,920
component might still be a potential

374
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,750
threat so the combination of those cyber

375
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,110
attack on the system might still be an

376
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,110
open area to explore so the main

377
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,400
takeaway from this presentation is the

378
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,860
power system has been traditionally

379
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,160
designed to withstand some level of

380
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,620
disruptions and modality attack is one

381
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
of those disruptions so everything I

382
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,270
showed in this presentation has been

383
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,670
exist in the system for a long time and

384
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,250
what's more cyber attacks to bring

385
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,930
attention to the community of power

386
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,870
system there's a lot of research going

387
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,420
on there so hopefully our work along

388
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,340
with this presentation can encourage the

389
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,560
collaborations between the community of

390
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,040
cyber security and the community at

391
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,419
power system and we do believe those

392
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,790
collaborations are critical to the

393
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,700
safety of our of our future power grid

394
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:16,099
we would like to acknowledge National

398
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,650
great support to our work thank you very

399
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,579
much for attention please let me know if

400
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,580
you have any questions

401
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:35,639
okay we have time for one or maybe two

402
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,710
quick questions hi Michael Anderson UC

403
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,720
Berkeley so you seem to have considered

404
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,490
mostly a step change where you just

405
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
increase the load and then you look at

406
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,850
how the grid responds to that

407
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,280
have you considered oscillation where

408
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,899
maybe you Inc you introduced a load and

409
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,000
then the grid responds by load sharing

410
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,830
and you know normally tripping out loads

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,900
is quite fast and responsive but

412
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,090
reintroducing them is slow so if you

413
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,470
then you know remove the artificial load

414
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,820
that the attackers have created you

415
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,390
could maybe cause an over frequency

416
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,220
excursion yeah that's a great point and

417
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,470
I thank you for bringing that we have

418
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,510
some back slides that's actually

419
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,030
including our paper but we have that

420
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:15,810
result right here that's something you

421
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:19,139
are talking about so first at this lies

422
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:22,590
the low increased and then system react

423
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,640
to date and then we weigh de cristal or

424
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,129
remove that road again

425
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,710
and then the frequency go over however

426
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,440
still we don't see the immediate action

427
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,600
from the system there might be action

428
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,610
after this situation lost last for a

429
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,600
longer time but the generator can react

430
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:42,090
by the time thank you thank you very

431
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,340
much really interesting I wonder if your

432
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:49,800
software if users are available publicly

433
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,780
currently not the reason is our world a

434
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,760
prime these two two different systems

435
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,460
and realize that the configuration

436
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,890
parameters that system virus a lot it

437
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,980
may give us already a difficulty to

438
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,230
apply the two from one to the other we

439
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,570
we think we should make it more easier

440
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,790
to use before we put it online yeah but

441
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,950
it will be really very valuable if it

442
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,460
will be made available thank you thank

443
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:17,220
you okay last question while the next

444
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,170
speaker sets up talk yourself from

445
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,450
google has there been any consideration

446
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,980
or have you heard of any cases where you

447
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,280
take almost a distributed systems

448
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,260
approach like like having say

449
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,720
protections on the individual meters

450
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,320
from looking at like massive spikes in

451
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,320
consumption

452
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,490
comment on that yeah so currently were

453
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,620
looking at the transmission system the

454
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,390
reason is we're seeing the the backbone

455
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,610
of the power system raise more

456
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,280
importance were cared about like the

457
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,199
safety of the larger real customers but

458
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,450
that's a good point and as I think

459
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,669
definitely a future work that we can do

460
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,919
on the distribution system and how to

461
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:58,789
isolate the cyberattack like immediately

462
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,799
in the small small region all right

463
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:04,510
let's think being one more time thank

464
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,510
you we've had
