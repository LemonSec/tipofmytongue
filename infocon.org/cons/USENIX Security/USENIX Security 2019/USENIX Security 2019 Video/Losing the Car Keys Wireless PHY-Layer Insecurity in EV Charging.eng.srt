1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,500
hi my name is Richard Baker I'm here

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,410
from Oxford and I'll be telling you a

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,570
little bit about

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,380
what we've done in why this physical

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,970
level security in easy charging now I

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,529
probably don't need to tell anyone that

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,960
Eva charge you becoming quite a big

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,960
thing this is all the charging spots

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,519
just in the area around Santa Clara all

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,800
the green ones are normal low-power

11
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:39,540
trickle charges which are anything from

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,269
just a bee extension lead out of the

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,120
wall and then this handful of orange

14
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:48,210
points indicate a new generation of

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,919
faster DC high-powered chargers that

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,800
promise to bring charging times right

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,800
down but also to make for a much smarter

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,230
charging interaction and that's because

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,309
powers not really everything here it's

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,239
very useful if you're on a long journey

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,979
sure you need to charge up quickly but

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,649
most journeys on that they're shorter

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,940
ones just around the local area and

24
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:11,009
electricity is everywhere why make an

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,300
errand of going to a gas station when

26
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,759
you can just charge up wherever it is

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,740
you're going so the other element of

28
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,840
what these new technologies provide is a

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,630
much deeper integration of charging into

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,310
everyday life and this could be reactive

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,050
charging where the vehicle knows what

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,789
the price of electricity is and can make

33
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,560
choices about when to charge or even

34
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:31,200
full-blown vehicle-to-grid where you can

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,300
give power back say to power your house

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,369
during the day of peak times and then

37
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,619
recharge at night when electricity

38
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,929
prices are cheaper or it can also be for

39
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,550
convenience as your roaming around it

40
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,709
would be nice to not have to carry as

41
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,420
you do at the moment a stack of RFID

42
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,739
cards and a whole host of apps for

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,610
exactly which charging at what you're

44
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,030
going to be on at the destination

45
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,830
instead the vehicle when you plug it in

46
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,679
can identify who you are who it is an

47
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,420
authorized billing on your behalf and

48
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,950
with this widespread deployment we can

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,289
imagine additional services being built

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,729
on top be they just connecting to a

51
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,880
smart home and you can access it through

52
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,530
a lexer or some service when you're out

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,329
like having something delivered to the

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,670
car because the service knows exactly

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,750
what spot is parked in or even just a

56
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,238
service that tells you where it is

57
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,110
you've parked because you've forgotten

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,430
all of that's underpinned by

59
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,290
communication and this is really about

60
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,300
building a platform that can allow all

61
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,220
of this on top and of course it's

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,830
important to secure this early one

63
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,090
because it's going to be being wise for

64
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,770
a deployment in it only gets more

65
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,530
expensive to change as time goes on

66
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,810
but also because previous work sadly in

67
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,000
earlier generation charges has found

68
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,630
that a number of security volunteers are

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,820
absolutely out there but we're in the

70
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,170
middle of a format war this is what the

71
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,209
experience is like if you turn up at one

72
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,489
of these big charges you've got a choice

73
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,720
of the different charging standards you

74
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,220
need to pick the one that suits your car

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,330
unless of course you have a test there

76
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,940
in which case you've got a completely

77
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,160
different separate network as well the

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,550
point is there's this variation in fact

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,450
there are four major DC charges CCS is

80
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,270
which is what I'll be talking about

81
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,160
today the combined charging system and

82
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,260
this is primarily EU and US

83
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,150
manufacturers there's then Chadha motor

84
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,840
on the first developed by Nissan

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,610
primarily Japanese cars supercharger of

86
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,600
course is Tesla's proprietary format and

87
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,640
then GB T 2 or 2 3 4 which is a Chinese

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,900
national standard and what's interesting

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,420
here is there is a difference between

90
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,140
the way they do communication so three

91
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,850
on the right

92
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,070
or use can bus which we've just been

93
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,910
hearing about in detail this control in

94
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,670
car communication whereas CCS is based

95
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,109
on power line communication PLC puts an

96
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,179
IP stack on top and then uses

97
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,270
recognizable internet technologies above

98
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,880
that these were quite interesting for us

99
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,660
because it's adapts what was originally

100
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,980
a domestic LAN PLC technology one that

101
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,680
has a private network mode will

102
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,209
appreciate key just like a Wi-Fi network

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,010
and instead uses it in this public

104
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,410
setting where the participants may well

105
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,750
never haven't met each other before it's

106
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,730
also very well known that PLC tends to

107
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,670
leak signal by radiation out of the

108
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,950
cables that it's music it wasn't just

109
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,869
academic curiosity though because it is

110
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,940
also supported by seven out of the

111
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,460
biggest ten auto manufacturers worldwide

112
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,820
by production and it's very very

113
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,040
prevalent in Europe underneath there are

114
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,959
two important standards the the major

115
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,550
one is the ISO standard one five one one

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,109
eight and this defines everything from

117
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,970
the physical layer right up to the

118
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,700
charging loop and the messages exchanged

119
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,190
there in what you see deployed at the

120
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,849
moment though is an interim standard in

121
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,550
701 21 and this is cut down standing

122
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,720
that doesn't have all the more advanced

123
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,580
technologies that I just described these

124
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,569
these future capabilities but the

125
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,609
physical communication

126
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:48,300
they'll say so we can observe one and

127
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,949
reason about both and we were looking

128
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,990
really it just quite a simple threat one

129
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,659
or very weak threat model a purely

130
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,699
passive eavesdropper but one who acts it

131
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,550
wirelessly despite this being an

132
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,779
entirely wired system and these are

133
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,369
quite nice for the attacker because they

134
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,529
don't have to modify anything they don't

135
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:06,270
look suspicious as they try and change

136
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:08,999
the charger or or interfere with the

137
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,219
process then just sit nearby either in a

138
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:13,259
car perhaps in another space visiting

139
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,849
public car park or perhaps with the

140
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,709
device they've planted but in a much

141
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,839
more unobtrusive location because of

142
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,639
this Wireless property you all they want

143
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:25,050
to do is retrieve any private data

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,080
that's being sent why well a few things

145
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,709
popped in mind one is of course to track

146
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,919
people the underlying plc technology has

147
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:36,869
in per device MAC addresses is unique

148
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,938
you could use this by watching a number

149
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,569
of charges to keep track of where it

150
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,639
will go

151
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,439
you might monitor an individual house

152
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,759
and say I'd like to know when people

153
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,819
come and go from this house but it's

154
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,800
gonna be empty or perhaps to keep track

155
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,599
of what what Max Martin what

156
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,189
manufacturers you're seeing at a

157
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,959
particular public charge site for

158
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:57,809
instance hey has this car that's just

159
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,819
turned up is it a really expensive one

160
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:02,279
that's being left unattended now or is

161
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,599
it or is it something cheaper from a

162
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,629
technical perspective error there are

163
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:08,219
some other possibilities because the

164
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:10,919
more services you might put on top of

165
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:12,808
this this channel the more possibility

166
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,729
beer services out to the Internet or to

167
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:16,589
local services that they're sensitive

168
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,079
data they're to be to be observed as

169
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:21,449
well and in fact some some recent work a

170
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,069
couple of months ago also found charges

171
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,379
out in the world with control

172
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,180
technologies open on this lake youtell

173
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,009
net web web management consoles and so

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,079
it might be interesting to be watching

175
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:35,249
when say a technician is coming is

176
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:37,529
working on the charger it's also a fun

177
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:39,899
full-sized case where there is at least

178
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,610
one charging network I'm aware of who

179
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,279
already do provides an automated billing

180
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,529
approach and they just use the MAC

181
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,499
address here associating with a customer

182
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:51,269
account so when of Cascia turns up it

183
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:52,979
looks up the MAC address and charges the

184
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,870
appropriate customer so by getting those

185
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:59,700
there might well be a possibility for

186
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,170
or doing a bit of of charging fraud so

187
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,150
with these things in mind we we went on

188
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,770
the road we got three vehicles all

189
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,049
implementing this this interim din

190
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,700
standard and we drove around for about

191
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,680
eight hundred miles all around southeast

192
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,240
England visiting all kind of places

193
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,860
hotel supermarkets garages and so on

194
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,290
4:54 unique charging sessions at each

195
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,480
site we deployed a software-defined

196
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,610
radio as a receiver and then place the

197
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,740
antenna in various in quite an

198
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,450
exploratory placement in some cases just

199
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,580
as a baseline you know in the vehicle

200
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,409
itself or right by the charging cable

201
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,210
we're expected to have a very strong

202
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,100
signal and so I mean perhaps more

203
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,919
realistic attack of location so passing

204
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,560
by the vehicle on one side of the other

205
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,000
in an adjacent spot perhaps over on the

206
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,880
left there where you know where it

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,440
attack a good park or hidden in foliage

208
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,830
or clutter that's nearby there might be

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,900
a reasonable hiding spot you can see

210
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,820
some here on the left this is a baseline

211
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,229
case this is just in the car and on the

212
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,190
right you can see that little silver

213
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,690
square that's right down by the cable

214
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,980
and then further away on the Left we're

215
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,110
hidden behind a hedge and the target

216
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,610
vehicle is the other side and then the

217
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,410
right hand one it's about four or five

218
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,410
meters away in an adjacent parking space

219
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,600
of the supermarket we usually try it

220
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,000
with a couple of vehicles at once where

221
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,010
we had the eavesdropper trying to

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,180
collect the signals from both and see if

223
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:26,039
these were separable or if they

224
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,140
interfered upon them and we found there

225
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,720
were emissions visible identity sites on

226
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,159
every run it really varied in some cases

227
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,350
these weren't very strong like on the

228
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,789
left-hand plot here this is right by the

229
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,260
charging cable you can see this very

230
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:41,579
distinctive spectral pattern this is

231
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,780
distinctive to this particular PLC

232
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,700
implementation you can see these deep

233
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,079
frequency not just as it tries to avoid

234
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,050
interfering with other technologies in

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,270
the band but this is still apparent even

236
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,699
in the the bay behind in the bay next

237
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,380
door despite interference despite the

238
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,190
attenuation you can still even to the

239
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,840
humanoid make out this pattern and so

240
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,790
then we developed an eavesdropping tool

241
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,710
and I won't go into this in detail with

242
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,360
all these pockets are doing but

243
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,769
ultimately the signal comes in the top

244
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,119
left it passes along this

245
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:12,009
coding chain at the bottom and this is

246
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:14,170
just a software implementation of a

247
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:17,589
standard PLC receiver for the underlying

248
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,329
plc technology when message is a spit

249
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,009
out at the end they recorded to a

250
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:24,299
database along with any metadata that

251
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:26,439
was required along the way and also

252
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,389
should the receiver happen to be in

253
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,730
possession of encryption keys for the

254
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:32,470
network it will also indicate the Mac

255
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:38,259
screams decrypt them and store those as

256
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:39,549
well with the signal I showed you before

257
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,769
perhaps unsurprisingly we could

258
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:43,540
certainly see messages at every single

259
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,119
site on every single run hundreds or

260
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,069
even thousands in a single run it was a

261
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,319
much more varied picture when we were

262
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:52,349
talking about successful messages

263
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,998
messages have validated their checksums

264
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,220
here varied really is the word it

265
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:58,989
different from site to site and also

266
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,079
from run one run to another even at the

267
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:03,999
same site and this could be large

268
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,248
differences between sites like the

269
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:08,499
layout and arrangement of the charger

270
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:10,239
and also simple things like just parking

271
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:13,029
the car at a different orientation or

272
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:16,029
other activities going on their body in

273
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,009
general being closer was was better but

274
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:21,819
it was very hard to predict much beyond

275
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:23,470
that I will say though that this was far

276
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,599
from an optimal setup the hardware the

277
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,610
software even our process of doing it

278
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,689
could certainly be improved and I think

279
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:34,059
you could you could build on these

280
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:35,889
numbers the most interesting time to to

281
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,029
eavesdrop was right at the start of the

282
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:39,939
session because there a couple of values

283
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,670
that exchanged here the vehicle Mac that

284
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,849
we talked about before this is there's a

285
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,699
scene a couple of seconds into a session

286
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,040
you need per vehicle and we observe this

287
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,660
to be stable over three months which

288
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,490
really underpins the idea of how this

289
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,199
could be used as an alternative for a

290
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,589
customer identifier in an auto charge

291
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:01,240
system in in fact two of the three

292
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:03,309
vehicles we were also able to acquire

293
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,589
this value outside the initial setup but

294
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:08,618
this is by far the easiest the other

295
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,929
value is the nmk and this is the

296
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:13,239
appreciate master key for the network

297
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:15,579
and this is how this private network was

298
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,949
mapped into a public setting the keys

299
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:20,560
just given from the charger to the

300
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:23,020
vehicle the start of the session

301
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,010
so in effect the wall each of the

302
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,370
messages are encrypted

303
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,200
AES one to eight if the attacker can

304
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,020
acquire this message as well they can

305
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,630
recover any traffic at the fight layer

306
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,520
and you can see it here not again that's

307
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,960
in detail but at the top you've got the

308
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,939
end of this setup and the key

309
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,220
distribution and then the initial

310
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,870
discovery processes the vehicle finds

311
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,330
out where the charge controller is and

312
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,960
then it kicks off the Chop main charge

313
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,960
you loop itself

314
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,430
so what encryption sits on top well in

315
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,860
the din standard that we were looking at

316
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,130
there is nothing else beyond it it's

317
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,080
just the everything's in plain text but

318
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,880
it is only charging control buts that's

319
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,720
satirize there so it's a question of

320
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,000
whether you're interested in the

321
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,470
charging control or not for the full

322
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,470
ISOs and there's a much more complicated

323
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,720
security model the purpose-built PKI

324
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:18,150
that underpins TLS between the vehicle

325
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,140
and the charger and also additional

326
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,029
additional security of the application

327
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,589
layer where values can be passed on such

328
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,110
as if they go into an energy provider to

329
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,120
be used for billing but this isn't

330
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,390
Universal this does depend on the

331
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,460
particular use cases and they vary based

332
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,199
on what services you're using what

333
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,520
payment options select is what

334
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,260
environment this is happening in via

335
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,230
public or a private or a trusted

336
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,580
environment and some things are out of

337
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,920
scopes are particularly for additional

338
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:49,060
services discovery certainly requires

339
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,430
mandatory TLS but what happens after

340
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,109
that is considered active scope and of

341
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,760
course this is ultimately just an IP

342
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,140
link between these two devices there's

343
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,180
nothing stopping you just putting your

344
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,180
own traffic code for it if you chose to

345
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:07,000
those are some fun little aside before

346
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,689
we finish we do this with about $1,000

347
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,700
or so of SDR equipment but there are

348
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,339
chipsets available off-the-shelf that

349
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:20,230
support doing eavesdropping man natively

350
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:22,180
and we have had success for about $35 or

351
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:26,950
so modifying one of these to use

352
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:29,739
wirelessly and and use it successfully

353
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,870
against at least domestic PLC networks

354
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,589
from which these charging networks were

355
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,879
derived

356
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,920
you know it's still an open question

357
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,139
whether the same techniques will work

358
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,729
effectively for for charging

359
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,269
communication I think they probably will

360
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,709
and the effect of that would both be to

361
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,509
reduce of course the price but also

362
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,810
substantially the complexity for an

363
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,810
attacker

364
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:54,579
so infusion up quite quickly I think

365
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,819
there are a couple of things that are

366
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,378
interesting say from here one this is an

367
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:01,300
entirely wired system there's no

368
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,339
intentional wireless component anywhere

369
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,258
in it but still we have to think about

370
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,579
it under a wireless rate model because

371
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:09,420
of the technologies that are underneath

372
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:13,649
we have to read about in those terms

373
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:15,430
- while this every reason to expect that

374
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:19,029
eavesdropping we've seen here won't

375
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,920
continue into into later standards the

376
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,839
security model is case-by-case I think

377
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,479
it's unlikely that we're going to

378
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,499
predict accurately right now all the new

379
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,540
services that are going to emerge

380
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,069
especially with this rabid competition

381
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,998
that we have between charging networks

382
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,998
who's going to become dominant

383
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,569
irrespective of that there's also the

384
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,829
question that or the issue that

385
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:44,019
persistent unique identifiers for

386
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:45,849
vehicles are being broadcast right now

387
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,819
every time you plug a car into a CCA

388
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,059
charging station and I don't see an

389
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,769
immediate change to that in the future

390
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,899
we informed all the manufacturers we

391
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,930
tested and some of them we're in contact

392
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:02,410
with still and we're continues in future

393
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,120
work which is now on an active attacker

394
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,009
on what capabilities they have both of

395
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,839
the physical layer and up from there I

396
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:11,220
hope to be able to bring that to you

397
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,220
soon enough thank you

398
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,219
Thanks I was curious how we might think

399
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,870
about incentivizing adoption of

400
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,080
countermeasures is that something you

401
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,100
thought about it yes I'm willing since

402
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,290
imposing something I haven't thought of

403
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,090
quite as much I mean I suppose there's a

404
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,660
certain amount of whether public opinion

405
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:36,510
swears one way or another we did find

406
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,360
there was the engagement for industry in

407
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:42,090
wanting to to control interest and also

408
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,320
a faith that the the measures in the

409
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:48,090
upcoming standards will do this

410
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,260
adequately I think many of the count

411
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,330
emissions that would be more serious

412
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,700
here or more civil more effective are

413
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,170
quite expensive and so where I think we

414
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,600
would probably need to have cases where

415
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,130
this wasn't working well in practice

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,100
before that was that was true doesn't

417
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,840
that twice

418
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,760
Karen Shulman UC San Diego so I'm

419
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,890
curious actually about the wired threat

420
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,200
is there the circuitry that's in that

421
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,330
like charging pedestal does that block

422
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:18,000
all the plc from going into the rest of

423
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:19,350
the power network or you know the short

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,020
answer is No

425
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,820
although the long answer is it's not

426
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,110
something I've studied extensively

427
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,310
however I can direct you to related work

428
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,340
that in fact one of the slides I

429
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:31,229
mentioned simulated worry about the the

430
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,630
telnet and web web console they phone

431
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,800
something exactly that is can you plug

432
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,220
in you know say you're at a service

433
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,870
station

434
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,150
can you just plug in in the cafe and be

435
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,380
on the same network it is just something

436
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,020
that's considered in the design

437
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,950
documents for the standard I think in

438
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,870
practice it's probably something that's

439
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,170
going to be quite controlled where they

440
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,610
don't know to what extent that's you

441
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,599
know there's one element which is can

442
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,460
you just plug into some of the nine

443
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,320
socket hidden away there's another one

444
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,270
which is if you're sitting is another

445
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,560
charging spot can you access track in

446
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,660
there and that's also that's also

447
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,760
fascinating I think probably yes in fact

448
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,170
there is there's another thing very away

449
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,359
in the standard that says what happens

450
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,860
if due to crosstalk between these cables

451
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,109
I happen to be pairing with the wrong

452
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,448
charger how do I resolve this problem

453
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,889
and so I think the very presence of that

454
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,140
so yes you probably could do something

455
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,500
there interesting Thanks Thank You

456
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,560
Richie thank you

457
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,560
you
