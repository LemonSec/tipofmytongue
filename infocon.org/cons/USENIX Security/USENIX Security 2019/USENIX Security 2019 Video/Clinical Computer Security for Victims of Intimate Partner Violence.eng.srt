1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,070
thank you for that kind introduction so

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,500
today I'm going to tell you about our

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,360
recent work to help improve support for

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,779
victims of intimate partner violence or

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,040
IPV I said know that some of the content

6
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,170
of this talk can be emotionally

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,509
distressing but it is important to

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,550
discuss and I hope to leave you all

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,920
feeling encouraged by the opportunities

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,920
that exist for us as technologists to

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,470
help people let me start by telling you

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,350
a story it's made up for privacy reasons

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,839
but it is representative of situations

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,530
that IPV victims experience with

15
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:50,330
technology abuse Carol filed for divorce

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,000
from her husband after years of his

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,890
abuse she saw a receipt on their joint

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,350
credit card statement that he bought an

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,350
application named mSpy which she looked

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,580
up and learned it could get her location

21
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,619
messages and take pictures of her

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,630
secretly she didn't know if it was

23
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,369
installed on her phone or not but he

24
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,619
keeps showing up at places that she goes

25
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,260
and follows her to make matters more

26
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,990
complicated Carol realized that he also

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,750
hacked her Facebook account he logged

28
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,119
into it to pose as Carol and he used it

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,040
to send non-consensual intimate images

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,020
of her to her boss Carol responded by

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,240
changing her Facebook password which

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,160
made her us ex-husband really angry and

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,170
he forced her to tell him the new

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,060
password and he threatened her with

35
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,120
physical violence if she tried changing

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,710
it again this threat escalation made it

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,800
impossible for Carol to keep control

38
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,250
over her account then after their

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,350
divorce

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,900
Carol's ex-husband received joint

41
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,509
custody over their child when the child

42
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,120
is visiting him he has direct access to

43
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,540
the child's tablet which is syncing

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,640
images and apps with Carol's phone Carol

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,710
doesn't realize it but this access to

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,240
the child's tablet is how her ex is

47
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:07,309
getting her pictures so not every IPV

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,639
situation involves this much technology

49
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,190
abuse but many do and in our work with

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,760
survivors we encounter situations like

51
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,940
Carol's routinely for context

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,799
IPV is very widespread and prior work

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,510
highlights the types of harms that we

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,950
have heard about in Carol situation and

55
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,470
finds that

56
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,109
rise in a large fraction of cases that

57
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,180
people have heard about but one thing to

58
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,550
note is that these types of tech abuse

59
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,890
aren't only complicated problems in

60
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,860
aggregate but also in individual

61
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,140
situations such as Carol's which are

62
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,069
already complicated in the amount in the

63
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,890
ways that technology is used against her

64
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:51,280
given all of this the question is how

65
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,179
can we help victims like Carol as

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,330
technologists our first inclination

67
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,970
might be to try to fix various software

68
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,760
flows and designs that exacerbate tech

69
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,849
abuse like victims being locked out of

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,190
their accounts by abusers but it would

71
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:09,500
be naive to think that improvements to

72
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,530
technology would completely mitigate

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,079
tech abuse for someone like Carol to

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,040
help victims in the short term we need

75
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:21,349
socio technological interventions to add

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,880
perspective to this thought let's take a

77
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,160
look at the current state of help

78
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,489
someone like Carol could find for her

79
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,650
tech abuse situation in New York City

80
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,359
were fortunate to have a municipal

81
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,400
government organization called the

82
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,489
mayor's office to end domestic and

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,380
gender-based violence or ng BV which

84
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,200
runs what are called family justice

85
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,049
centers or F J C's in each of the five

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,089
boroughs of the city these family

87
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,310
justice centers provide direct services

88
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,760
to victims who in this context are

89
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,680
called clients for example clients might

90
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,239
be referred to lawyers for ongoing

91
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,730
criminal cases against their abuser

92
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,359
receive help with transitional housing

93
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,608
and more in my groups prior work freed

94
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:07,519
at L investigated this ecosystem in

95
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,079
detail and found among other things that

96
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,030
there are currently no services

97
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,060
available to help victims with their

98
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,548
tech abuse their caseworkers and lawyers

99
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,380
are doing their best to help but they

100
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,589
reported a lack of expertise in

101
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,419
navigating this abuse with the client

102
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,070
one thing we should be doing is helping

103
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,409
improve training for these advocates in

104
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,050
order to help them help their clients

105
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,680
with tech abuse but for situations like

106
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,140
Carol's

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,419
which are not uncommon we feel that

108
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,979
there is an unmet need for additional

109
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,530
computer security and privacy expertise

110
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,720
and so we would like to expand the

111
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,159
existing ecosystem to help victims

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,350
navigate more complicated tech abuse in

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,510
this paper we propose a new idea called

114
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,550
clinical computer security where a

115
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,150
client like Carol can meet face to face

116
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,820
with an IP V tech consultant this is a

117
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,489
new role we are defining which requires

118
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,219
expertise in both technology and

119
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,160
computer security but also training to

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,260
do client centered advocacy our vision

121
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,480
is that Carol could talk to such an IP

122
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,730
VTech consultant about her technology

123
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,450
concerns and receive help that is

124
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,640
sensitive to the context of IP V however

125
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,830
professional roles for navigating tech

126
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,500
abuse according to this vision don't

127
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,570
exist so part of the research challenge

128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,970
in this setting is discovering evidence

129
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,390
based best practices for clinical

130
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,280
security so we're taking a first step

131
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,250
towards realizing what it means to have

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,289
a good clinical security practice we

133
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,240
designed a first-of-its-kind protocol

134
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,480
for meeting with victims and deploying

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,970
IP VTech consultants this includes new

136
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,250
tools and procedures to check privacy

137
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,620
and security configurations on victims

138
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,810
digital accounts scanning their mobile

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,210
devices for spyware applications and

140
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,880
integrating safety planning into tech

141
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,710
abuse decision-making to evaluate our

142
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,140
model we have been running a field study

143
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,539
in partnership with the ng BV since

144
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,270
November 2018 we're trained members of

145
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,970
our team meet with victims in this new

146
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,320
role of an IP VTech consultant in the

147
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,730
paper we report on helping 44 clients

148
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,280
before I describe our protocol and

149
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,280
results in more detail it's important to

150
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,900
discuss our methodology because victims

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,059
of IP V are a highly vulnerable

152
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,669
population and we wouldn't want our

153
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,310
research to cause any harm we therefore

154
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,280
took many steps to ensure our research

155
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,560
was as safe as possible for clients

156
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,450
first we partnered with the ng BV to

157
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,880
conduct the field study on-site at

158
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,800
Family Justice centers whose staff are

159
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,370
trained professionals in working with IP

160
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,680
V victims of course we received IRB

161
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,510
approval for all of our research but we

162
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,160
additionally took in

163
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,860
stakeholder guided approach to our

164
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,990
protocol design we first conducted a

165
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,380
series of focus groups in which we met

166
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,300
with a total of 56 IPV professionals to

167
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,780
elicit feedback on our protocol design

168
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:10,470
including lawyers case managers and GBV

169
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,059
leadership NYPD and other advocates we

170
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,580
ended up going through nine rounds of

171
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,080
changes on our prototypes as a result at

172
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,330
which point we went through an

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,700
additional review process with the ng BV

174
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,650
leadership they concluded that our

175
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,840
research would be beneficial to their

176
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,780
clients and that our safety procedures

177
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,929
were sufficient only then did we run our

178
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,340
field study with the clients so now I'll

179
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,930
present more details on our final

180
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,530
protocol that we deployed and then

181
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,750
report on the field study the clients we

182
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,640
meet with first receive referrals from

183
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,340
their case manager lawyer or other

184
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,530
advocate to meet with us after our

185
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,599
consultation is complete we refer them

186
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,429
back to their advocate who serves an

187
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,260
important role in ensuring that the

188
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,540
client can conduct what is called safety

189
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,090
planning as a result of discoveries made

190
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,520
during our consultation for instance

191
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,169
recall that in Carol story her abuser

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,729
threatened her with physical violence

193
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,880
should she change her facebook password

194
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,920
in the future so she and her advocate

195
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,960
would need to decide whether it is safe

196
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,030
for her to change any vulnerable

197
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,210
passwords we discover given her current

198
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,750
situation during the actual consultation

199
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,669
there are three phases understand

200
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,590
investigate and advise I'm going to

201
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,000
discuss each of these in turn and I'm

202
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,219
going to use Carol as a running example

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,700
for why we did procedures the way that

204
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,190
we did recall that Carol story a story

205
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,840
is really complex the three phases of

206
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,210
the consultation are aimed at helping

207
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,090
the tech consultant understand these

208
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:41,790
issues investigate what the potential

209
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,830
root causes are and help advise her

210
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,589
about what options she has to improve

211
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,570
her computer security as I said I'll be

212
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,350
using her story as a running example as

213
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,330
if we had done a consultation with her

214
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,880
so we start by trying to understand

215
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,160
Carol situation and tech problems via a

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,560
semi-structured interview format where

217
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,420
we begin by asking her what her chief

218
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,770
tech concerns are and letting the

219
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,930
conversation go from

220
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,819
this might sound like it should be easy

221
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,400
but it turns out that these tech

222
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,110
problems can become very complicated in

223
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,150
Carroll's case there were issues with

224
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,580
her being hacked and impersonated on

225
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,319
Facebook there is uncertainty of how her

226
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,010
ex-husband got access to her pictures

227
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,600
concerns about spyware and so forth in

228
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,270
order to tease apart all of these issues

229
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,760
we created the technology assessment

230
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,680
questionnaire or TAC to help guide the

231
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,720
tech consultant cover high-level

232
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,870
important questions that probe for such

233
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,350
compromises we also created what we call

234
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,660
the Tecna graph a tool to be used by the

235
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,000
IPV tech consultant to diagrammatically

236
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,219
map out the nuanced relationships

237
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,440
between the various people devices and

238
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,260
accounts that are related to carol's

239
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,510
tech abuse the Tecna graph can help the

240
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,760
consultant visualize these relationships

241
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,010
and spot potential issues such as

242
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,800
accounts with passwords that the abuser

243
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,810
can guess which in Carroll's case could

244
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,930
explain how her Facebook was originally

245
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,310
hacked by the end of this phase the

246
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,349
consultant should have a better

247
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,089
understanding of all the aspects of tech

248
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,060
abuse that a client like Carol is

249
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,920
experiencing then the consultation

250
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,839
proceeds to the next phase investigate

251
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,439
to try to get to the bottom of her chief

252
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,960
concerns this phase involves two kinds

253
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,090
of investigations one is programmatic

254
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,220
tool based investigations and the other

255
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,170
is manual Security and Privacy checkups

256
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,630
we start with programmatic

257
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,729
investigations and it is important to

258
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,050
note that we ask the client for

259
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,210
permission to use their device and

260
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,120
navigate their accounts and we actively

261
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,040
involved them in the process

262
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,900
remember in Carol's story that she saw a

263
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,240
receipt for mSpy on her joint bank

264
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,310
account with her ex-husband and so our

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,320
understand phase would have surfaced a

266
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,079
concern a spyware being involved in

267
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,850
stalled on her devices in fact prior

268
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,830
work by my group did a measurement study

269
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,870
that showed that there are a wealth of

270
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,420
spyware tools out there that are easy

271
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,700
for abusers to download and install on a

272
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,520
victim's device and that work showed

273
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,430
that existing anti spyware tools are

274
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,319
ineffective at finding them so we needed

275
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:17,130
to create a whole new tool for finding

276
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,920
spyware which we call is d is d queries

277
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,260
the device

278
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,620
over USB to get a list of apps installed

279
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:26,350
on it is d then checks that list against

280
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,120
its own blacklist and it uses additional

281
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,880
heuristics to check whether the device

282
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,060
is rooted or jailbroken and runs a

283
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,670
simple reg X check for words like spy or

284
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,040
track in the title and app ID for apps

285
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,279
that are on the device that aren't on

286
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,649
our blacklist we also took great care to

287
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,930
ensure that is D was safe for victims of

288
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:49,870
IP be it does not collect any personal

289
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,000
data it does not install anything on the

290
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,980
scan device and we confirmed that

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,040
popular spyware apps don't detect the

292
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,620
use of is D when we get when we scanned

293
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,480
Carol's phone we found no spyware but

294
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,120
she noted that she obtained a new phone

295
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,370
after leaving her ex-husband we

296
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,940
therefore turn to Carol's accounts for

297
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,339
manual investigation remember that aside

298
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,199
from spyware Carol had concerns about

299
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,170
continued access to her Facebook account

300
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:19,359
by her abuser as well as concerns about

301
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,279
her location being tracked and family

302
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,560
sharing between her phone and her son's

303
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,689
tablet in order to investigate these

304
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,518
issues we manually navigate to the

305
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,380
relevant security and privacy settings

306
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,410
for apps the client is concerned about

307
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,689
an added bonus is that this process

308
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,269
often turns into impromptu security

309
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,730
trainings where we show the client how

310
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,160
to find the relevant interfaces and what

311
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,390
their features mean actually it turns

312
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,949
out that remembering how to navigate

313
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,079
through all of these security and

314
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,240
privacy settings is difficult even for a

315
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,880
security expert because there are so

316
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,890
many products out there so we developed

317
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,750
a set of cribs for the tech consultant

318
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,569
to find the relevant interfaces on

319
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,449
popular platforms like Google iCloud and

320
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,550
Facebook for Carol this part of the

321
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,079
investigation would reveal that she is

322
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,839
using family sharing with her child

323
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,000
which coupled with our knowledge gleaned

324
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,860
during the its understand phase that her

325
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,079
ex-husband had access to the child's

326
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,240
tablet we surface a plausible

327
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,050
explanation for how her photos were

328
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,730
obtained without her consent now that we

329
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,069
have investigated Carol's devices and

330
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,500
accounts and found possible causes of

331
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:29,150
some of her chief concerns we can turn

332
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,640
to discussing the situation with her

333
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,860
first we summarized the findings so far

334
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,960
of our consultation recapping the

335
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,630
concerns that carol shared with us and

336
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,790
the issues that we uncovered in Carol's

337
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,890
case we didn't find spyware on her

338
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,900
current phone but we did uncover the

339
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,029
issue of her child's tablet syncing

340
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,189
images with her phone that are then

341
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:51,830
accessible by her ex-husband during

342
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,810
visitation well at this point it might

343
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,000
be tempting to tell Carol to shut off

344
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,829
family sharing remember that she faced

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,390
the risk of escalation of physical

346
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,970
violence for changing her Facebook

347
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,830
password so an important aspect of our

348
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,720
consultation is that we take a

349
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,970
client-centered approach which means

350
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,980
that Carol is considered the expert on

351
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,450
her situation and the role of the

352
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,760
consultant is to empower her with

353
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,470
information she can use to make the best

354
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,150
decisions for herself for her security

355
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,880
with the help of her referring

356
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,920
professional when issues are discovered

357
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,439
we get in touch with Carol's case

358
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,390
manager to conduct safety planning where

359
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,330
we enter a three-way discussion of the

360
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,089
risks of making changes poses to Carol

361
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:34,100
safety and only after completing such an

362
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,930
assessment are we able to assist her

363
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,160
with the changes that she feels safe

364
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:42,140
making like turning off family sharing

365
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,390
so our overall clinical design was

366
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,550
refined from the feedback of over 50 IPV

367
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,189
professionals but we wanted to see how

368
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,349
it go with actual clients so we began an

369
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,300
ongoing field study with the ng BV and

370
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,430
advertised the study to IPV

371
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,189
professionals who referred clients to us

372
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:01,189
in the paper we reported on

373
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,430
consultations with 44 clients in total

374
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,920
scanning 75 devices identifying many

375
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,599
cases of unwanted logins potential

376
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,510
password compromised and for three

377
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,910
clients potential spy where we reassured

378
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,270
many clients as well about the lack of

379
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,850
tech problems the field study is ongoing

380
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,620
and we have continued to observe the

381
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,350
same kinds of tech abuse issues as

382
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,600
reported in the paper all of this begs

383
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,970
the question of how to evaluate whether

384
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,880
this consultation model improves

385
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,770
outcomes for clients we have seen

386
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,140
encouraging signs that our consultations

387
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,670
are valuable to clients the ng BV

388
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,470
practitioners are really excited about

389
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,370
our work and definitely want us to keep

390
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,800
doing it

391
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,809
we have lots of data from this study and

392
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,209
in a complementary paper that will

393
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:48,980
appear at CSC W later this year we

394
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,018
analyzed a lot of hours worth of

395
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,269
transcripts from consultations with

396
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,769
clients permission to record finding

397
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,149
that many of the clients reacted

398
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,220
positively to our consultation

399
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,680
expressing feelings of validation

400
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,110
reassurance and empowerment about their

401
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,300
tech concerns and expressing interest in

402
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,740
learning more about security and privacy

403
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,930
and tack more generally so to recap we

404
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,120
introduced a new idea called clinical

405
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,920
computer security and piloted a

406
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,779
first-of-its-kind field study with the

407
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,519
New York City mayor's office to end

408
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,620
domestic and gender-based violence and

409
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,829
we created new tools and procedures

410
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,360
along the way our field study has raised

411
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,550
a host of questions for future work

412
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,649
including outcome measurements of our

413
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,990
clinics developing a set of best

414
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,180
practices for including forensics into

415
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,309
the clinical model and adapting the

416
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,469
model for other at-risk groups such as

417
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:40,389
elder and child abuse in the context of

418
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,199
domestic violence

419
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:46,189
journalists refugees dissidents and more

420
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,790
thank you all right well now take

421
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:54,490
questions

422
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,490
[Applause]

423
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,070
hi

424
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,229
tark yourself from google so one of the

425
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,600
first of all thank you for doing this

426
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,980
work this is very very important one of

427
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:11,569
the big things that I was thinking about

428
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,240
is with the increase in third party like

429
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,909
IOT devices like especially in smart

430
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,920
home environments was there anything

431
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:22,010
that you notice in terms of an effective

432
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,470
way to say evaluate that for clients or

433
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,500
perhaps any unique challenges that you

434
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,840
found here yes so the question is with

435
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,780
IOT devices what does that look like in

436
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,429
our consultations and the tricky part is

437
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,410
these clients are meeting with us

438
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,270
face-to-face and some of them will bring

439
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,130
their devices in with them

440
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,350
for instance they'll bring in Amazon

441
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,470
echoes they'll bring in gaming consoles

442
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,330
they'll bring in fire alarms that they

443
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,920
suspect have hidden cameras in them all

444
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,580
sorts of devices from their homes and

445
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,380
for us the challenge is given the

446
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,860
plethora of all these different kinds of

447
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,320
IOT devices how can we create protocols

448
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,360
that cover all of them and the answer

449
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,120
isn't straightforward it's like we need

450
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,840
to be able to take these case-by-case

451
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,530
and so for instance one challenge with

452
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,010
like an Amazon echo is that if the

453
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,450
abusive partner registered in their name

454
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,180
Amazon doesn't allow you to deregister

455
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,660
that device at all you need to buy a new

456
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,780
device and so we've had concerns before

457
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:29,060
about can you still are these devices

458
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,980
are you able to repossess them and wipe

459
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,070
them or they still always tied your

460
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:38,420
abuser and so yeah that's definitely an

461
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,330
active challenge yeah I Cristina need to

462
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,280
retire Oh Northeastern University thank

463
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,720
you very much for your work I was

464
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,520
looking at the ongoing and open

465
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,960
questions and one of the items that I

466
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,620
don't see on the list and I was curious

467
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,780
if you thought about it is educating and

468
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,580
empowering the victims a few of the

469
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,889
things that you mentioned seem to pretty

470
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,300
much be the same so I was thinking that

471
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,590
at least some of them you know maybe

472
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,200
working with the mayor

473
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,990
sofie's or its organization you can have

474
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,580
some educational yeah so it's

475
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,549
interesting because when we meet with

476
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,889
victims often what everything that we're

477
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:15,440
doing we try to actively involve them in

478
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,850
so we'll explain to them what we're

479
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,250
doing as we're doing it likewise our

480
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,350
navigating their devices we explain like

481
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,690
what our spiral scan is doing they'll

482
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,370
generally ask us questions about how

483
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,610
they can improve their computer security

484
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,158
and one of the benefits there is that a

485
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,080
lot of them have many of them have

486
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,270
reported feeling like you know I've

487
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,620
learned something from this but there's

488
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,470
definitely a bigger question there like

489
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:43,610
how can we effectively educate people

490
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,899
and so there are like online movements

491
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,120
that try to tackle these sorts of things

492
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:52,209
but more research is definitely needed

493
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,209
there yeah thank you thank you Sam
