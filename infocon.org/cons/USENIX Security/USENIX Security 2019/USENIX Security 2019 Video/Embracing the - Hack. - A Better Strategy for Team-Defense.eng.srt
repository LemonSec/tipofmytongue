1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,880
thank you very much so really quickly um

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,080
thanks thanks for inviting me thanks to

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,419
you guys for coming out a really quick

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,220
overview of the talk I'm hoping today

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,290
like not to spend too much time

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:33,110
convincing you that enterprise security

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:36,110
currently sucks it mostly does and what

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,739
I want to talk about is a possible new

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:42,140
way of an addressing enterprise defense

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,180
and and for the most part what I'm

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,530
trying to convince people is that we

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,200
should be more comfortable with

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,540
happiness traditionally people have

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,600
looked down on it and I'm saying that

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,379
it's actually a the most viable path for

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,900
enterprise defense today I'll talk a

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,870
little bit about one of the free tools

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,860
that we've released and mainly use it as

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:09,770
a lens to view both a successful

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,110
enterprise defense and a happy one and

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,759
and so we'll talk about that and and

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,520
probably the biggest thing that I'm

23
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,730
hoping for is to give you folks a bunch

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,369
of links to a bunch of talks by people

25
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,260
smarter than me so so even if my talk

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,970
completely bombs you should grab the

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,600
slides because there'll be links to

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,690
smarter people saying smarter things I

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,600
won't talk about my bio too much the

30
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:38,000
main point of it is I ended up spending

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,270
about seven years as a system engineer

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,729
about ten years as a network attacker

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,289
I'm looking for new ways to attack stuff

34
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:51,830
a small stint as a CEO and now work as a

35
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:55,369
product vendor and and the main reason I

36
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,190
say it is to let you know that I've kind

37
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:01,250
of got a pretty holistic view on on

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:04,850
what's breaking networks how to break

39
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:08,360
networks and then some hope for for

40
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,848
realistically defending them um so one

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,510
of the interesting things today is if

42
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:18,048
you look around in some instances we're

43
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,049
not in as bad a situation as we were so

44
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:23,120
for a few hundred dollars you can buy

45
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:26,599
products today that have a really

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,370
good security posture so from Apple

47
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,709
you're getting the latest iOS devices

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,989
and Nanta Schenker straight after me is

49
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,269
gonna convince you otherwise but but you

50
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,430
can buy hardware for for a few hundred

51
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:41,239
dollars with really good security

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,829
promises if you saw Matt Muller talking

53
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,560
you'll see the range of mitigations and

54
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,049
built-in SDLC changes that Microsoft has

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,629
made over the years um to kind of make

56
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:56,840
sure that automated were mobile attacks

57
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:59,260
a thing of the past and this is a brave

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,299
thing to be saying um while the RDP

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,310
zero-day hangs over everyone's head um

60
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,340
but but you'll see changes from Apple

61
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,459
changes from Microsoft changes from

62
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:14,359
Google Google's Chrome team is

63
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:16,879
ridiculous their project zero team is

64
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:20,840
probably some of the world's best bug

65
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,849
hunters they chrome Chromebooks today

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,549
again a few hundred dollars and you've

67
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:28,399
got Hardware back to security um that

68
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:32,870
gives you pristine machines in a few

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,900
seconds um and I guess what that means

70
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,079
is we can all declare victory and and go

71
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,000
home and obviously that's right and

72
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,489
obviously that's not true and and

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,799
instead of just taking my word for it

74
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,349
I'm gonna do something that I often do

75
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:52,220
which is refer to quotes from these two

76
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:55,280
people so Brian snow for those of you

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,579
who don't know him was the director of

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,609
information assurance for the NSA and

79
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:04,579
and he gave this talk at a conference in

80
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:06,680
Malta and and his quote there was to

81
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,230
tell everyone that look your systems

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,879
continue to function and serve you not

83
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,340
because your guys are doing anything

84
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,260
particularly special but mainly because

85
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,019
your opponent's haven't chosen to take

86
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,048
you out yet and and this is something

87
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,150
that people in industry have been a kind

88
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:27,679
of turning a blind eye to for a really

89
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:29,900
long time and um if you caught Alex's

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,810
talk this morning a few years back Alex

91
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,260
gave a talk titled app SEC is eating

92
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,710
security and and he started off by kind

93
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,400
of

94
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,590
letting the fortune 500 into two groups

95
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,039
where he said you kind of have a secure

96
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,340
100 which is a bunch of people who know

97
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,240
how to do security and then referred to

98
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,400
the others as the toasted 400 okay and

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,860
and the interesting thing to ponder

100
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,919
about the struct is there's a few things

101
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,830
that are interesting here the one is for

102
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,080
you to make it into the fortune 500 your

103
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,008
market cap is not something to be

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
sneezed at

105
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,000
so these are not corporations that

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,299
couldn't find money in the security

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,910
budget these are mega cops with billions

108
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,330
of dollars at play and Alex is referring

109
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,240
to them as the toasted 400 and and he's

110
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,460
not even saying that the secure 100 are

111
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,680
invulnerable to attack he's saying they

112
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,430
know how to play the security game and

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,470
and with the toast at 400 they don't and

114
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,490
they probably don't know that they don't

115
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,410
know ok and and without trusting any of

116
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,470
them you kind of have a reasonable

117
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:46,400
existence proof different groups keep

118
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,099
putting out different studies on on the

119
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,070
the status of breaches and things like

120
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:54,139
that and and if you go back to the 2015

121
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,150
m trans report they'll tell you that

122
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,280
most companies find out they've been

123
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:04,099
hacked about 205 days after the original

124
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,619
incursion as recently as last year

125
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:08,479
poni mom did a study and that number is

126
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,300
a hundred and ninety seven days

127
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,630
according to them and and if you ask me

128
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,909
those numbers are better than they are

129
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,759
in the real world because in most cases

130
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,460
these guys actually talked about data

131
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,870
that's self identifying so so when

132
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,909
you're talking about credit card data

133
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,280
for example the credit card gets used at

134
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:30,770
some point and these organizations find

135
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,109
out that they've been owned and and

136
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,448
ignoring that like you turn on the news

137
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:39,020
on any given day and there's a new org

138
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,759
that's been terribly broken and what's

139
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,859
interesting is you end up hearing the

140
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,419
same sort of things from the

141
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,650
organization of course there's a press

142
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:48,529
release that tells you that they really

143
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,179
take security seriously and give you a

144
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:53,060
link to free credit monitoring

145
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:56,000
um but but from our side from the guys

146
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,639
trying to defend networks um there's a

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,970
few things that come out pretty

148
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,919
consistently okay um and it's almost as

149
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,840
predictable as the organization saying

150
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,659
that they really care about our security

151
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,210
and and the first one that you hear is

152
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,340
that now management really needs to buy

153
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,820
and like management needs to take stuff

154
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,508
security um and this may have been true

155
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,380
before but but like it's just not true

156
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,599
anymore

157
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,479
like like management has started caring

158
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,219
about security for a long time like like

159
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,580
billions of dollars hundreds of millions

160
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,229
of dollars is being spent on security

161
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,039
there's a security conference going on

162
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:39,370
almost every day of the year so it's not

163
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,810
just a hundred people getting together

164
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,169
like security has become big business

165
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,889
like the RSA business hall overflows

166
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,650
with people and and at some point the

167
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:55,669
blackhat keynote looked like this like

168
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,039
this was Mudge back in in 99 walking in

169
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:02,780
front of the screen to to a small room

170
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:04,969
and and today the blackhat keynote looks

171
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,520
something like this right it's it's not

172
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,760
true that management haven't enabled

173
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,549
people lots of money is being given in

174
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,620
some instances it's security teams who

175
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,180
are now kind of skating by like

176
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,490
management thinks they've done something

177
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,680
they invested this money they both these

178
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,800
teams and they think that we've got

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,099
answers except for the most part we

180
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,289
don't have good ones and the other thing

181
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,110
that happens are fairly recently

182
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,689
whenever there's a break is you'll see a

183
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,729
whole bunch of thought leaders on the

184
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,250
internet scream about how the

185
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,190
organization hasn't taken care of the

186
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,079
basics and people will scream like now's

187
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,290
the year we need to get back to basics

188
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:50,689
and it's it's super common you'll see it

189
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,390
all over the Internet it's it's what

190
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,490
Twitter is made for right like blah blah

191
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,890
blah they didn't do password management

192
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,839
like how stupid of them they didn't do a

193
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,590
two-factor authentication and of course

194
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,510
there's a

195
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,150
of things wrong with this but but

196
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,910
probably a the easiest way to summarize

197
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,939
it is is there's a kind of survivorship

198
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,240
bias playing out here right like this is

199
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,640
a mind map made by a guy called Rafiq

200
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,250
Rahman who talks about all the things

201
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,410
that a sea soul needs to control and of

202
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,540
course all of those things are basics

203
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,370
and what happens is when there's an

204
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,290
attack that affects one of them then

205
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,930
someone goes oh they didn't take care of

206
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,610
that basic ok but but of course there's

207
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,739
a zillion of them and we're just picking

208
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,830
on the one that happened to get someone

209
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,040
owned and and the simple thing is that

210
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,320
if it was simple it would be done nobody

211
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,319
is deliberately taking money and getting

212
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,910
their networks compromised so so there

213
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,630
are problems that then need to be

214
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,360
addressed

215
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,300
and and the last one that I want to pick

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,670
on from this sense is the well you know

217
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,890
what these companies need to do is to

218
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,810
learn to think like an attacker like

219
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,420
like people just need to learn to think

220
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:09,650
like an attacker and and this idea isn't

221
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:13,250
new right back in 93 Dan farmer and

222
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,890
Witsel venema released Satan and Satan

223
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,320
the the whole point of Satan was that

224
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:22,400
you could start looking at your network

225
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,980
with the eyes of an attacker it spawned

226
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,860
a billion-dollar scanner industry as

227
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,880
everyone starts to make scanners and add

228
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,180
plugins but the question is I guess 26

229
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,740
years later what are we telling people

230
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,800
to do now

231
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,320
this is Trend Micro advertising an

232
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,270
upcoming thing for August 22nd where

233
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,300
they will teach you to think like an

234
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:50,540
attacker ok think like an hacker and and

235
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,760
your network will will be all ok and and

236
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,730
of course this doesn't work right Adam

237
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,520
szostak has actually written about this

238
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,230
in the past where he says like telling

239
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,920
someone to think like an attacker is

240
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,800
just not prescriptive enough and what

241
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,630
what Adam likens it to is expecting

242
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,020
someone to be a was in the kitchen

243
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:15,050
because you told them think like a chef

244
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,779
ok and and it's something we forget but

245
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,209
but if you step out of our comfort

246
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,829
a little bit go into the kitchen try

247
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:25,128
thinking like a chef and see how that

248
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,748
works out for you um and what's

249
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,540
interesting is we thought about this a

250
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:31,339
little bit and and there are definitely

251
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:35,059
lessons that can be taken from offense

252
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:37,189
okay um but what we think is that for

253
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:40,339
the most part people end up taking the

254
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:43,459
wrong lessons and we gave a talk about

255
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:47,449
this a little while back at a conference

256
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:51,258
called t2 in Helsinki and and I'll talk

257
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:53,540
a little bit about this maleeh we

258
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:57,249
believe that there are some things that

259
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:01,490
offense was doing and offense gets right

260
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:04,879
almost accidentally and and one of the

261
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,490
things we can do as a defenders is start

262
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,829
to isolate those things and focus on

263
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,439
them and and one of the things that that

264
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:14,479
offense gets a right accidentally

265
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:17,899
probably the biggest thing in my opinion

266
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,230
his offense naturally has very tight

267
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:23,149
feedback loops and and you see this in a

268
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,449
in a bunch of different ways but but

269
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,639
probably the simplest way to put it is

270
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:32,180
if you a bad attacker if you're an

271
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,309
attacker and you suck you know it um you

272
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,800
know it's really quickly but you can

273
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:40,399
suck as a defender for a really long

274
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,529
time and not know that you suck okay and

275
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,410
and this tight feedback loop allows

276
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:48,769
people to sharpen their skills and focus

277
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,959
on the right things um Dino des Eaux V

278
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:54,709
in the past gave a whole talk called

279
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,209
attacker mats or attack a meth uh here

280
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:58,309
in America where he was talking about

281
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:01,069
the importance of figuring out the cost

282
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,959
of things the cost of attacks and it's

283
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:05,449
something that attackers end up knowing

284
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,279
intuitively because when they pulling

285
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,839
off the attack they know what it costs

286
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,149
they know the effort that goes into it

287
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,149
and it's something that defenders have

288
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,759
to try to divine and and this feedback

289
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:19,490
makes it really hard and and what it

290
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,620
leads to is the fact that attackers are

291
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,559
quick to throw away things that

292
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,899
absolutely don't work and defenders

293
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,019
carry around this legacy for much longer

294
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,700
than makes sense and and you see it with

295
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,250
bad processes and bad

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,020
policies in companies that end up being

297
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,660
carried out that actually don't do

298
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,270
anything um one of those that I want to

299
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,150
focus on for this talk and it's probably

300
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:49,160
the bulk of this talk is that attackers

301
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:52,640
write code okay and if personally I

302
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,420
think this is not controversial but

303
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,510
recently Twitter prove me wrong um my my

304
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,510
central thesis here is that I almost

305
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:05,630
never see good attackers who don't also

306
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,550
code okay and and somebody else said

307
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,320
this on Twitter and people lamb basted

308
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,140
him because they are awesome

309
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,200
and they don't code but but I'm gonna

310
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,350
agree with a the original Twitter here I

311
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,960
think coding is a superpower and I've

312
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,140
almost never seen a good attacker who

313
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,210
doesn't and and again this is fairly

314
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,920
obvious right like if you see any good

315
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,990
attacking team you'll see they patch

316
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,170
their tools you see them building tools

317
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,900
and and again it makes perfect sense

318
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,240
right it's more than a decade since Marc

319
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,630
Andreessen released his software is

320
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,580
eating the world of paper and and if

321
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,980
software is eating all of these other

322
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,700
industries it makes obvious sense that

323
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,310
software will be eating ours also um and

324
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,830
you starting to see this now when you

325
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,770
take a look at really good defensive

326
00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:00,140
teams um so I've got a few examples here

327
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,210
and if you haven't seen these talks um

328
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,699
it's really talk they're really talks

329
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,610
that I suggest you go check out so so on

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,790
the top left you have a Nate McCauley

331
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,860
and Diego uh and and both of them were

332
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,770
asked where when they did this really

333
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,680
interesting talk about trust anchors and

334
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:21,140
and the whole point of trust anchors if

335
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,780
you break it down simply is in your

336
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,660
organization having micro services that

337
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,730
handle your valuable stuff and and the

338
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,160
logic there was that you force an

339
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,320
attacker to operate inside your premises

340
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,510
so an attacker doesn't get the ability

341
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,240
to steal your data and view it offline

342
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,860
to view anything meaningful he has to

343
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,970
view it while inside of your

344
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,420
organization and next to him you have a

345
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,000
four who gave

346
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,530
talk on Facebook again a super

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,440
interesting talk where he talks about

348
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,990
how they got Facebook using two-factor

349
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,210
authentication and and what's

350
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,790
interesting about the talk is they end

351
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:05,580
up using a combination of SSH patches

352
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:07,380
duos API and the end result that they

353
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,160
end up with allows people to

354
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:14,189
authenticate faster using their to fact

355
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,480
solution than without it so developers

356
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,810
inside of Facebook

357
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,820
apparently end up using the solution not

358
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,959
because it's safer but because it's

359
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,970
quicker and it also happens to be safer

360
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,700
the bottom two you've got folks at

361
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,190
Netflix talking about their use of EB PF

362
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,600
and how they use it to instrument all

363
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,420
the things

364
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,920
Ryan Huber gave a similar talk using a

365
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,010
competing framework so they're using

366
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,079
oddity built into the kernel um and and

367
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,720
the really interesting thing about all

368
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,390
these guys are that's worth noting is

369
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,490
that they not traditional security teams

370
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,340
just telling people what they can't do

371
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,320
their security teams actually building

372
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,290
the code that these organizations are

373
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,830
running on and and we think it's it's a

374
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:04,020
pretty big change and if you go back to

375
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,180
what Alex was saying someone actually

376
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,910
asked him or it was part of his talk

377
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:12,360
that says well what differentiates the

378
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,400
secure 100 from the toasted 400 and and

379
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,310
you'll notice central there is the

380
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,550
ability to create and not buy solutions

381
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,429
ok so this ability to actually build

382
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,040
stuff comes through and and once you

383
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,590
build tools the follow on that comes

384
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,629
from that is you start to build and

385
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,720
unless you completely terrible at it um

386
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,210
you start to build infrastructure your

387
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,540
tools start to build on top of each

388
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,210
other

389
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,520
and again this is all a veiled attempt

390
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,750
to make you guys you folks watch my

391
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,790
older talks but way back in in 2010 we

392
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,220
gave a talk trying to convince people

393
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,040
that their threat models were mostly

394
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,450
wrong and and one of the things that we

395
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,220
were saying at the time is like so this

396
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,049
is 2010 it was pre snow

397
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,000
it was pre a whole bunch of stuff and

398
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:06,030
you'd still see people talking about

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,309
cyber war in terms of well Georgia was

400
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,590
dust like there was a large das attack

401
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,720
against them and what we were saying is

402
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,270
actually if you look at good security

403
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,700
teams the thing to notice is that they

404
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,639
build tool chains and they build

405
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,740
infrastructure um and again I'm not

406
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,679
saying attackers do it because they

407
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,830
smarter it kind of just happens as a

408
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,169
natural consequence of writing tools and

409
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,389
building them and and I gave a bad

410
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,760
example at the time so we were a pen

411
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,460
testing company and and we built this

412
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,460
one-off tool that extracted data from

413
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,120
networks using timing so across the

414
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,760
Internet

415
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,559
we've got command execution we run this

416
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,990
timing attack and based on the time

417
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,020
we're able to extract data and within a

418
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,539
few months we generalized it into a tool

419
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,760
called squeezer that could be used for

420
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:59,730
sequel injection and and the joy of

421
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,020
squeezer using timing attacks is that we

422
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,000
got it to the point where you could

423
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,789
transfer binaries off a company's

424
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,679
network just using timing attacks and

425
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:10,049
and then right at the bottom we

426
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,030
introduced this new tool that allowed

427
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,820
you to tunnel through company networks

428
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,799
so if you had just sequel injection or

429
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,559
just some sort of attack against a web

430
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,809
server you could tunnel entire TCP

431
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,200
conversations through those two

432
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:27,870
compromised hosts to net to host on the

433
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,179
network just because we went from one

434
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,340
time to squeezer um to this new tool

435
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,700
called reader and and again the whole

436
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:38,610
point is that this happens naturally for

437
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,850
attackers and if you remember the NSA

438
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,250
leaks um now the various NSA leaks that

439
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:47,219
come out they not just a collection of

440
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,470
zero-day okay like while people kind of

441
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,270
focus on the zero day much more

442
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,429
interesting is seeing the frameworks

443
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,010
that they have sitting behind it there's

444
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:59,400
entire frameworks for exploitation and

445
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:03,480
exfiltration because again um that's

446
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,030
what attackers do unfortunately both are

447
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,580
nate and diego are pointed out during

448
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:11,070
their talk that this is also what

449
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,300
defenders do okay and they pointed out

450
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,689
that when they both

451
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:18,060
they trust anchors inside of square you

452
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,940
quickly start to see other opportunities

453
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:25,800
to use them once you've built it things

454
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,240
just kind of naturally add on um and so

455
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,480
I'm gonna talk a little bit here on a

456
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,940
start breaking into um our canary tokens

457
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,880
so canary tokens is a completely free

458
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,540
service you go online to canary tokens

459
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,780
org

460
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,520
you greeted by this and and something

461
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,800
like more than a hundred thousand people

462
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,420
have bought have used canary tokens and

463
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,720
actively use it to figure out whether

464
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:52,020
they've been compromised or not and like

465
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,910
in a UNIX for UNIX first I'm literally

466
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,280
not standing up here to tell you about

467
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,190
how clever the thing we built is I'm

468
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,440
actually expressly doing the opposite I

469
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,780
want to tell you how stupid the thing

470
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,460
that we bought is but how it's useful

471
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,170
anyway and so if if you go to canary

472
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,770
tokens on org you'll be greeted with

473
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:16,140
this screen and right at the top I've

474
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,660
selected the first type of canary token

475
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,660
which is a web bug and everybody's been

476
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,870
using web bugs forever you put in an

477
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,630
email address to get your alert and then

478
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,969
you put down some sort of a reminder

479
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,520
that says here's what I'm doing with

480
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,460
this token so in our case I go use annex

481
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,030
demo desktop we hit create and

482
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,940
essentially what we get back is a URL

483
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:45,149
and and the logic here is dead simple

484
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,610
when someone visits that URL the system

485
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,280
will mail that email address that

486
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,990
reminder that we just put in and so the

487
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,050
logic is that you can sprinkle these

488
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,480
things in a whole bunch of places so in

489
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,320
this case we said it's on our desktop

490
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,810
for usenix

491
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,480
and when an attacker compromises your

492
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:06,960
machine and finds this thing clicks on

493
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,660
it they get back nothing of import and

494
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,330
you get back a message telling you hey

495
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,670
listen from this IP address with this

496
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,149
browser somebody just clicked on this

497
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:20,820
link okay at this point you're not more

498
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,280
complex than browsing your web server

499
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,409
log file ok completely straightforward

500
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,070
but

501
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:32,570
already you'll see the first signs of

502
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:34,129
almost fortuitous cleverness so not

503
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,830
something we intended to be clever you

504
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,320
accidentally get it right and that's the

505
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,540
fact that if someone's visiting you you

506
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,909
can already do more than just grab their

507
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,040
IP address right so once they're

508
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,440
visiting you you can start geo-locating

509
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,540
the IP address you can enumerate the

510
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,030
plugins in their browser if they've got

511
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,850
a web RTC leak you can check what their

512
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:58,220
real IP address is okay and all of that

513
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,120
because an attacker happen to click on

514
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,350
your link okay so it's it's pretty

515
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,850
straightforward and and again pretty

516
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:10,879
stupid and in the in the light of a

517
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:13,520
really simple the next token that I'm

518
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,710
gonna talk about is a DNS token okay and

519
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,050
this one again is super simple we select

520
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,320
the DNS token we put in our email

521
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:23,899
address and we put in our reminder which

522
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,710
in this case says the USENIX demo for

523
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,440
DNS um the system gives us back some

524
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:33,020
sort of domain and the logic here is

525
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,490
that if an attacker ever looks up that

526
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:39,170
domain he gets back she gets back some

527
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,020
sort of response you don't care about

528
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,600
and you get back a notification telling

529
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:48,550
you hey listen someone's just looked up

530
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,050
this DNS entry again completely simple

531
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,450
completely straightforward it's a

532
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:59,510
hundred lines of code or two lines of

533
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:02,210
pearl it's it's yeah but what's

534
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,879
interesting is already the starts to

535
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:08,570
give you options as a defender that

536
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,820
don't exist otherwise so how many of you

537
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:15,919
are running a slack in your

538
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:18,950
organization's quick show of hands okay

539
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,930
so so enough of the audience's oh one of

540
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,210
the things that everyone's kind of

541
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,040
worried about is what happens so so

542
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,730
everybody focuses on what happens when

543
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,050
slack gets compromised which is fair but

544
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,060
one of the things you should be worried

545
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:35,149
about is what happens when someone in my

546
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,919
org gets compromised because someone in

547
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,390
your slack Channel searching for

548
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,060
interesting keyword

549
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,250
we'll generally turn up enough stuff out

550
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,560
of context that'll be pretty bad for

551
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,570
your organization and right now there's

552
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,419
not a lot you can do to defend against

553
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,850
it and canary tokens give you a really

554
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,610
even just the two super stupid tokens

555
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:58,429
that we've saw give you a simple way to

556
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:02,530
tripwire this so so what you see here is

557
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:06,140
I do a slack search for the word hello

558
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:08,090
four months ago I didn't go into that

559
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,090
conversation and change where someone

560
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,429
said hello everyone and instead I make

561
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:16,429
the message hey everyone here's a link

562
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:19,670
to top secret password vault in the

563
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,890
organization you drop it in and you

564
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:24,020
forget about it and the logic there is

565
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,540
when someone in your organization gets

566
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,430
compromised the attack is going to go

567
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,590
into their slack and search for top

568
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,140
secret password vault or other stuff

569
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,360
that you care about find this link click

570
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,220
on this link and you now know that

571
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,379
somebody's searching around in your

572
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,710
slack for things that they that they

573
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:45,410
shouldn't be you can't buy anything to

574
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,720
do this yet um and I don't think any of

575
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,330
the big vendors I can't see semantics or

576
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,000
McAfee caring about protecting your

577
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,980
slack but if you've got people actively

578
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,600
building stuff in your organization and

579
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,030
if you've got primitives that you can

580
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,340
use it becomes a natural consequence and

581
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,300
you can see other places you can chew on

582
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,669
this in right

583
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,010
you've got people running salesforce.com

584
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,980
let's include a link that says export

585
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,410
all data you've got people running some

586
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,690
sort of SAS service um you can start

587
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,180
trip wiring these things up with trip

588
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,510
wires that only get hit by malicious

589
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,550
activity and and the whole point is that

590
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,010
once you have those two simple

591
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:28,010
primitives that say let me know when

592
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:31,010
someone views a link or let me know when

593
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,050
someone resolves the DNS name you start

594
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,180
to come up with a whole bunch of other

595
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,760
tokens that are built on top of that

596
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:41,960
okay and and I won't go through all of

597
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:45,260
them but of course the two super simple

598
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,220
obvious ones are you can start token in

599
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,710
office documents or PDFs right so so

600
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,960
really simply if someone goes to

601
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:58,460
sigh goes to the token site puts in

602
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:01,820
their details for a microsoft word token

603
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:05,029
you end up with a word doc again pretty

604
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,639
straightforward attacker finds this word

605
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:10,520
doc which you can put anything in or

606
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,010
name anything the moment they click on

607
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,470
it it's gonna come back and give you an

608
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,270
alert um so so in the background this is

609
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,880
fairly straightforward for anyone who's

610
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,408
ever had to work with word um once

611
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,159
you've got a primitive that says if

612
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:27,529
someone resolves this dns name or if

613
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,450
someone visits this link the question

614
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:32,390
for you is just how can I make word

615
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:35,059
resolve the DNS name how can I make word

616
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,460
visit a link and you'll know there's a

617
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,240
ton of options right embed a graphic

618
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,059
into it

619
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,640
embed metadata into it and and we do a

620
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,889
couple of these for you automatically so

621
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,140
the moment this doc is opened it reports

622
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,740
home and lets you know again it's it's

623
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,710
so simple it can't really be effective

624
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,020
right and and of course uh the reason

625
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,140
I'm up here talking to you is because it

626
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,908
is like even with this free canary token

627
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,649
service

628
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:06,500
we've got bunches of examples of people

629
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:09,320
writing in and telling us hey we had no

630
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,740
idea this was happening we created all

631
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,750
these Word docs we strew them around

632
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:17,419
outside of the web server root and we

633
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,730
found people actually reading them we've

634
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,130
got this one up on on Twitter just

635
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,779
because everything looks nicer when you

636
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,179
realize that the Russians are attacking

637
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:28,880
you but but but again this is an org

638
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:32,299
that spins on security has an active

639
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,070
security team and this free thing let

640
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:35,600
them know that there's much deeper

641
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,830
rabbit hole that they need to worry

642
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:43,039
about um and once you say I can insert a

643
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,260
remote web a remote URL in a word doc

644
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,470
someone clever in the company says well

645
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,720
hey if we inserting a URL why don't we

646
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,360
do more like why don't we insert a macro

647
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,860
into the document and of course once

648
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,830
you've got a macro running on your

649
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,500
attackers machine that macro can start

650
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,210
to do more interesting stuff so your

651
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,580
macro can start getting the actual

652
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:06,649
username start seeing who register

653
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,049
the copy of Windows or go as active as

654
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:13,000
you want to but again all of these are

655
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:17,149
really small jumps once you start off

656
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,210
building something and in the same way

657
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:23,539
um you can start exploiting the quirks

658
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:27,140
of the system you operating on so so two

659
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:30,140
cute quirks um that we want to way of or

660
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,360
want immediately aware of is that if you

661
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:36,940
on a Windows network or if you're on a

662
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:40,189
Windows machine Windows still respects

663
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,370
Windows dot I and I okay so for those of

664
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:47,149
you who have bad memories of Windows 3.1

665
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:49,610
or 3-1-1 so sad meaning those ini files

666
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:51,649
still work and one of the things allowed

667
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,039
in the ini file is that you allowed to

668
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:56,750
set a desktop background and one of the

669
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,240
things about Windows is that you can set

670
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:02,299
a desktop background to be a UNC path

671
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,779
okay so what you can do is take a canary

672
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:08,330
token that same vanilla URL and set it

673
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:10,850
as the desktop background and now when

674
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,039
an attacker browses that folder his

675
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,010
windows will try to set his background

676
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,440
to that UNC path effectively telling you

677
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,720
that somebody has just entered this

678
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,330
directory um and you can start to get

679
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,289
cuter because windows allows you to sign

680
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:29,449
binaries they also need some way to

681
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:32,210
enforce a crl so that they can revoke

682
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,760
those certificates and that's just a URL

683
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,730
that's gonna get touched so you can set

684
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,889
a canary token as the binary is crl and

685
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,960
now whenever someone runs that binary

686
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:44,719
you get a ping telling you that this

687
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,929
binary has just run again it's super

688
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,559
cheap it's super hacky but IP config

689
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:54,019
that exe or Who am I on one of your

690
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,570
production servers probably doesn't need

691
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,460
to be run that often um it's probably a

692
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,100
good indication that your systems been

693
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,409
owned and in this case you drop the file

694
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,090
you forget about it and when it runs you

695
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:10,279
get your notification that tells you

696
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:11,990
that badness is happening um so the last

697
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:16,159
token example that I'm actually gonna

698
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:18,230
give here is this one which is you can

699
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:23,390
also start exploiting

700
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:26,390
sess platform quirks so the AWS API key

701
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,910
was an idea first spoken about by the

702
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,310
security team at Atlassian and

703
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,310
effectively on the Canary talkin console

704
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:37,129
it's exactly the same so super

705
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:40,460
straightforward you go in you say here's

706
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:42,980
my email address here's my reminder and

707
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:47,240
you say create my token and the system

708
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,640
splits back a valid working AWS API key

709
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,980
and this API key is completely

710
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,180
indistinguishable from any other API key

711
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,060
that you might be using in your

712
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,700
organization and again the logic is take

713
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:02,510
it put it on every desktop that you have

714
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:05,210
and when someone uses this API key you

715
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,310
get a message telling you the API key

716
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:11,990
that you stored on your CFO's machine

717
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:15,919
has just been accessed again it's free

718
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:18,170
IDs for all your desktops it doesn't

719
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,720
take a lot to drop down but it's a

720
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,000
really high-quality signal that

721
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,340
something's gone wrong on your CFO's

722
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,020
machine it doesn't matter how he's been

723
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,720
compromised and there's a zillion ways

724
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,570
he could get compromised what matters is

725
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,720
that somebody is now trying to access

726
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:38,689
AWS using a key that only your CFO had

727
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,540
so clearly something is has gone wrong

728
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:44,090
now what's interesting about the AWS key

729
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,210
is in the background we've got an entire

730
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:51,199
Rube Goldberg machine that generates

731
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:53,840
that token so request goes off using AWS

732
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,020
lamda service it creates something on a

733
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,149
fake account but what's important is

734
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,730
that all of that becomes possible

735
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,160
because we're just building on existing

736
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:08,780
infrastructure ok and the stuff becomes

737
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,370
trivial for you to integrate so if if

738
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,800
you out here and if you looking at

739
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,110
defending your network there's two

740
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,980
interesting reasons for why you want to

741
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:21,260
do this lots of us here are researchers

742
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,030
right and and what you want is to build

743
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,220
stuff that other people then build on

744
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,190
and what you'll see is even with a

745
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,160
simple framework like this you'll start

746
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,940
to see so so we've had Cullen Molina who

747
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,980
I think is

748
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,049
can hear before but has certainly spoken

749
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,059
all around the world and he's given a

750
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,029
talk on how you can detect reverse

751
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,039
engineering with tokens okay so you take

752
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:45,320
those same tokens you embed them into

753
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,289
binaries and when an attacker is

754
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,720
reversing these binaries you get various

755
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:53,120
stages of information so a they find a

756
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,789
link they have to check out that link to

757
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,949
see what's at that end point B you wrap

758
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,509
that link inside some sort of loop and

759
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,570
now you can tell if your attacker has

760
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:06,500
managed to unwind that loop to decrypt

761
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:08,569
to decrypt this text and and for example

762
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,060
the guys that crews automation have done

763
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:13,699
an entire talk on how to deploy canary

764
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,349
tokens at scale okay and they talking

765
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,178
about problems that we didn't even think

766
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:20,089
about at the time but but what's

767
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:22,069
interesting again is if you code and if

768
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:24,710
you build these tools they build

769
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:27,730
infrastructure and you start to see

770
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,290
smart people building on top of them and

771
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,780
again to take a step back for what we

772
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:37,040
actually looking for you start to see

773
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:39,040
real-world results okay so this is a guy

774
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,219
called shoves and he's a pretty famous

775
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,349
attacker he milks bug bounties from lots

776
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,879
of the big companies and he points out

777
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,889
that just the thought that the

778
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,839
credentials he's picking up are not

779
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:54,020
legit credentials or could give the game

780
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,810
away start to make him step slower on on

781
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,530
networks and that's kind of what we in

782
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:04,190
the game for and and the main thing to

783
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:07,849
take away from this is that the world

784
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:10,579
the tax surface currently is too fluid

785
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:13,099
okay and and if you sitting around

786
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:15,980
waiting for solutions that the big

787
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:18,410
vendors build by the time they build it

788
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,390
things have moved on and and it's an

789
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,490
inherent advantage that attackers have

790
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,490
had till now which is that they lighter

791
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,020
and they more agile and kind of the only

792
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,959
way you get to that is if you're

793
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,150
building your own stuff and building it

794
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,980
quickly and of course the natural

795
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,130
question that follows from this is

796
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,260
someone saying wait so you saying don't

797
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,510
build anything don't buy anything and

798
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:45,080
and of course that's not what I'm saying

799
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:47,420
for for one reason we now vendors

800
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,299
right and and for the most part I'd love

801
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,750
for you guys to buy stuff but but I

802
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,130
think what it points to is a change in

803
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:58,220
what we are buying

804
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:01,490
okay so so I think in an old throwback

805
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,500
to the UNIX philosophy instead of

806
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:07,549
looking for these single monolith

807
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:10,490
solutions like semantic or mcafee are

808
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,890
going to provide and fix everything what

809
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,979
you're looking for is small smaller

810
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:18,859
solutions that that effectively take in

811
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:21,230
input spit out output so that your teams

812
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,930
can chain them together and start

813
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,800
getting meaningful results and start

814
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:29,720
driving them as they want to

815
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,480
fundamentally we can't be expecting to

816
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,319
buy products and as a substitute for

817
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,530
thinking and and one of the fundamental

818
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,020
things if we go back to the topic of of

819
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:45,770
making things and embracing happiness is

820
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,560
is to avoid letting a perfect become the

821
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,840
enemy of good when we defending networks

822
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,720
and and you'll notice that attackers

823
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,090
don't do this um so so for years we used

824
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,640
to give people training on how to break

825
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:01,370
into networks and one of the things you

826
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,100
start doing from day one is telling

827
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:07,580
people yes your tool is not perfect like

828
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:10,330
like you get a reverse shell and your

829
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,860
shell doesn't echo the stuff you typing

830
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:16,400
yeah that's not how that shell was

831
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:18,860
intended to be used go on and on the

832
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,380
system you're doing something and it

833
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:24,500
works in some quirky way you as an

834
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,230
attacker you expect imperfection and you

835
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,450
work around it and as defenders for some

836
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,060
reason we've started to obsess over

837
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,939
perfect and and there's tons of

838
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:37,370
solutions that were really good that get

839
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:42,080
killed on the vine because they weren't

840
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:45,920
perfect way back in 2003 the the guys

841
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:49,040
from Indiana University released a tool

842
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,350
called Civic and and Civic essentially

843
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,800
would monitor all of your keystrokes all

844
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:56,360
of your Siskel's on an operating system

845
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,080
so that you could build honey pots with

846
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,870
them and civic was totally neat

847
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,940
and almost a year later someone gave a

848
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:07,270
talk at like cancer quest or black hat

849
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,060
on how to detect Sebek and the tech was

850
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:12,220
really smart it used timing differences

851
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,830
so you'd issue a command and see how

852
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,839
long the us talk to to execute it and

853
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,180
you could tell that Civic was running

854
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,490
and so from that point on people stopped

855
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:25,690
using Civic because hey it's detectable

856
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:27,640
and that's 2003 okay and and I guarantee

857
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,170
you if Civic was still running when

858
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,810
Snowden were running it was running

859
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,390
around owning random hosts by jumping on

860
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,370
open shares on Windows machines we'd

861
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,069
have a better idea of what he was doing

862
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,049
um just because if it was defeated in

863
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,840
the lab and defeated at a black hat talk

864
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,960
didn't make it useless um and it

865
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,720
shouldn't have been thrown away um we

866
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,050
don't have to be perfect as defenders um

867
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,970
we don't even have to win every battle

868
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,740
okay um something that often comes up

869
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,899
with canary tokens if someone says well

870
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,029
how do you get super wide deployment

871
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,430
like what if you miss something and the

872
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:05,680
answer is you missing something now like

873
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,870
like you're missing everything now put

874
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,940
these down and have a shot like like you

875
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,580
don't need trip wires to have a hundred

876
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,260
percent coverage you want them to make

877
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,540
someone really nervous about stepping

878
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,970
around in your stuff and occasionally

879
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,800
you'll get super lucky um and and you'll

880
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,500
find out things that you didn't know in

881
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,780
in fact this sort of thinking turns

882
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,910
around the paradigm because for years

883
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,640
everyone used to say that attackers

884
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:33,009
only have to win once and defenders have

885
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,540
to win all the time but if you start

886
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,790
thinking like this you start to figure

887
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,980
out that actually an attacker can win

888
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:42,040
everywhere and as a defender you just

889
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,600
have to find them once and if one of

890
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,520
those places is where you find them you

891
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,500
can start rolling incident response and

892
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,259
start containing them and getting them

893
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:55,080
out of your network um and if it's

894
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:57,820
stupid and works then it's not stupid I

895
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,190
kind of want to force especially this

896
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,790
crowd to start thinking about building

897
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:05,470
products and as an extension of that

898
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:08,410
building companies that build products

899
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,629
like everyone knows that the security

900
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,920
product industry has sucked for a long

901
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,230
time and it sells half

902
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,270
solutions with bad you exes that suck

903
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:20,210
that don't really do what they supposed

904
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:22,700
to and then we just go back to doing

905
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,680
other stuff and almost what you need to

906
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,160
do is throw your hat in the ring and and

907
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,950
start being the change you want to see

908
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,350
um if you do have an enterprise that

909
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:36,200
you're trying to defend one of the

910
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:39,049
natural defenses here is okay it's cool

911
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,000
Foursquare or Google or Apple to have

912
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:45,830
security teams that do defense like that

913
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,930
but we smaller and we can't and the easy

914
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,090
answer to that is what you're doing now

915
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:52,220
doesn't work either

916
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,350
like at least we should try something

917
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:58,040
different because at least it's got some

918
00:40:54,350 --> 00:41:00,589
hope for actually working out um so so

919
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,529
for the most part I'm saying what we

920
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:06,520
should be doing is getting use to

921
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:11,180
solutions that are quick dirty and hacky

922
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:15,200
they at least give us a shot that's all

923
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:18,169
that I've got um you can scream at me on

924
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,660
Twitter I'm at Harun Mir or I think

925
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,220
we've got time for other questions and

926
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,000
there should be a mic going around thank

927
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,000
you very much for your time

928
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:34,120
all right thanks everyone you can scream

929
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:37,810
at him with the mic right now if you're

930
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,299
interested we have a few minutes for

931
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,700
questions all right

932
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:55,260
shaggy you wanna walk towards the might

933
00:41:42,700 --> 00:42:00,390
go there hey nice truck I have a very

934
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:05,700
simple question so you are actually

935
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:08,500
banking on using documents or other

936
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,620
links that could help you you know to

937
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,450
organize the attacker but if we see it

938
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,730
from the attackers perspective and the

939
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:18,970
recent IOT botnets

940
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:22,150
that have been flourishing they do not

941
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:24,850
actually care about getting information

942
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:29,560
from your machine rather they want to

943
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:33,779
just grab your machine and use all of

944
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:37,600
those in a distributed fashion to attack

945
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,210
another disjoint device right so how can

946
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,540
using these cannery tokens be helpful in

947
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:46,750
this case right so so the first answer

948
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,360
is nothing you're gonna use is going to

949
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,340
defend you against every attack like if

950
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,700
someone's attacking you and doesn't plan

951
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:57,430
to use the data on your network supplier

952
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,520
in your data is not going to help you so

953
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:03,549
so mostly it comes down to knowing what

954
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,440
you likely to be attacked for and making

955
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:09,730
sure that you're protecting that stuff

956
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,770
um so as a company what we both like to

957
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,690
have mentioned is honey pots that detect

958
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,970
when they being attacked and our honey

959
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,670
pots can for example emulate SCADA

960
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,620
systems or IOT systems but it's a

961
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,870
different problem and and so for the

962
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,839
most part I think one of the one of the

963
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:28,509
reasons why hacky defensive defenses

964
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,910
work is because you look at what it is

965
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,370
you trying to protect against and both

966
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:36,520
solutions to do that instead of just

967
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:39,299
using a generic security solutions that

968
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,869
probably don't address your needs

969
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,640
the other question so

970
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:48,530
when you say that okay think from the

971
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,420
attackers point of view but knowing what

972
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:55,160
the attacker is gonna do with my machine

973
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:58,130
is an np-hard problem isn't it so I

974
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,549
think this so it's a good question and

975
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:03,260
and I think the easy answer is that

976
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:06,020
they're things that so so you can't

977
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,030
predict that someone's going to use your

978
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:12,470
all the desktops in your organization

979
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:14,420
for DDoS reflection the question is if

980
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,868
that's the thing that keeps you up at

981
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:20,800
night so I can tell you on our company

982
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:24,740
if somebody used us for a DOS attack I

983
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,200
think it's a bad Monday but if someone

984
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,270
were to read a customer customer

985
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,609
information that we have it would ruin

986
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,770
my company and so the thing that keeps

987
00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:36,430
me up at night is knowing when someone's

988
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,540
doing this the latter not the former and

989
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:41,859
you've got to figure out what matters

990
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,880
for you if you an IOT manufacturer

991
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:45,828
absolutely you should be thinking about

992
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,770
the lawsuit you're gonna get when every

993
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:52,180
one of your devices becomes an amplifier

994
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:55,819
in in a DDoS attack for the average

995
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:58,640
organization I'm not sure that that that

996
00:44:55,819 --> 00:45:05,300
should be what keeps them up thank you

997
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:07,730
thank you any more questions I last one

998
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,990
quickly you said many things that are

999
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:12,170
putting me in this sort of a logical

1000
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:15,169
bind when attackers learned quickly but

1001
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,910
then like let's not overthink and let's

1002
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,800
not be let's not let perfect be the

1003
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:21,589
enemy of God but like attackers will

1004
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,089
learn and run all the Browse windows

1005
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:25,759
with our internet disconnected machine

1006
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:29,450
and like disable desktops wallpapers and

1007
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,250
you know none of the internet like five

1008
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,049
years from now do you think these hacky

1009
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,030
defense solutions are gonna still be

1010
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,829
around because like yeah it's the phd

1011
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,750
lifetime is five years in itself yeah

1012
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:41,810
yeah it's it's a super good question and

1013
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,780
and I think I have multiple answers for

1014
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,950
it though so so rephrase the question is

1015
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,920
well you're going to start an arms race

1016
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:50,810
and and the one part of that answer is

1017
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,810
right now you're just losing the arms

1018
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:55,259
race like like get into the race and and

1019
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,840
so one part is that

1020
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,340
um the other part is even if attackers

1021
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,220
have to totally change what they're

1022
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:05,160
doing right now it's so easy that they

1023
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,379
don't have to like like let's let's stop

1024
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,100
that let's let's make that bit harder

1025
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:14,040
and and the pot like like good security

1026
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:16,080
teams your team like good security teams

1027
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,720
know that you kind of have this

1028
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,190
coevolution that happens and attack is

1029
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,759
up their game and defenders up their

1030
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:26,160
game and and I think the top security

1031
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,500
teams have known this and operate this

1032
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,020
way and and the problem that we have is

1033
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,480
that entry level teams or teams that

1034
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:36,060
aren't as well resourced think that they

1035
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,920
can avoid that game and and mainly I'm

1036
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:42,480
saying that I don't think they can um

1037
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,369
they've gotta get in that game - all

1038
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,920
right let's tank Haroon once more thank

1039
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:49,959
you very much

1040
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,959
[Applause]
