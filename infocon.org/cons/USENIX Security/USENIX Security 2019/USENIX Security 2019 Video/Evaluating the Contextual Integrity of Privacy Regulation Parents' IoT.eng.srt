1
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,100
hi everyone so I'm here to present our

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,160
work on evaluating the contextual

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,320
integrity of privacy regulations or

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,990
parents IOT toy privacy normos vs. Coppa

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,119
and this is joint work with Sara Vargas

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,130
and Nick themed stir from the Princeton

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,590
University Center for Infotech policy

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,350
and I want to point out that Sara

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,570
Varghese I worked on this project for

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:41,210
her senior thesis was instrumental to

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:42,860
getting it here today so in 2017 the

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,530
Federal Trade Commission updated its

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,050
guidance on Coppa to indicate that it

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,200
did indeed apply to connected Internet

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,330
of Things toys and for the duration of

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,760
this talk I'm gonna refer to just Coppa

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,550
but oftentimes what I mean is a

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,390
combination of Coppa the Act or the

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,209
copper rule which of the FTC's

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:08,150
guidelines on how online services need

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,970
to handle children's data so devices

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,540
that we're thinking about here are from

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,819
a variety of types toys like Internet

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,039
connected teddy bears robots tablets

25
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,450
fitness trackers that are all built and

26
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:23,090
targeted towards children under the age

27
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,549
of 13 and so what we want to know is

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,829
whether the data handling practices that

29
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,649
the FTC is requiring through Coppa are

30
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:33,469
actually aligned with parents privacy

31
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,389
norms and expectations in this space and

32
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:38,419
even more generally we'd like to know

33
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:40,009
you know how do we as a community go

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,770
about testing whether privacy

35
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,420
regulations in any area are aligning

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,959
with the social and cultural privacy

37
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,149
norms of the affected population now of

38
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,829
course these questions beg another

39
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,509
question to begin with which is how do

40
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,270
we define privacy norms in the first

41
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,340
place and for that we turn to the theory

42
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,139
of contextual integrity which is a

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,810
privacy framework that was originally

44
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:06,020
developed by Helen Nissenbaum at Cornell

45
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,939
Tech which defines privacy in terms of

46
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,038
norms and information flow

47
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,630
appropriateness in specific contexts

48
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,549
that's for the that's pretty

49
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,130
philosophical so let's break that down a

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,990
bit further by saying that the context

51
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,269
themselves can be defined according to

52
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,730
five parameters you have a sender a

53
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,390
subject and attribute and information

54
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,790
type a recipient and

55
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,890
transmission principle so for example if

56
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,350
you consider this example of an

57
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,970
information flow of a doctor sharing a

58
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,370
patient's medical records with another

59
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,830
hospital for continuity of care you can

60
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,110
divide that into the five parameters so

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,840
the doctor here is the sender the

62
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,610
patient's is the subject the medical

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,430
records themselves are the attribute of

64
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,170
the information type the other hospital

65
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,050
is the recipient of the information and

66
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,269
for continuity of care is a criteria

67
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,550
placed on the information transfer also

68
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,489
known as the transmission principle so

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,420
given this very clear-cut five parameter

70
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:06,600
model of a context we can then use this

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,119
to construct surveys which allow us to

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,010
test whether norms are being respected

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,550
we've done something like this in the

74
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,470
past in our previous work we use the

75
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,239
contextual integrity to try to discover

76
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,450
internet-of-things privacy norms not

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,890
related to children or toys and so the

78
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,440
work that I'm presenting today is

79
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,018
building off of that now where we're

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,640
actually looking specifically at privacy

81
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,670
norms regarding a particular piece of

82
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,260
regulation and this is a six step

83
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,200
process and I'm going to go over each of

84
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,690
these steps in detail so the first the

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,670
first thing we do is we choose parameter

86
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,709
values for each of those five parameters

87
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,070
that are relevant to the regulation of

88
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,769
interest so here we chose as senders a

89
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,859
list of smart toys including robots

90
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,390
smart dolls walkie-talkies and others

91
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,780
for this subject in the attribute

92
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,279
parameters we chose different types of

93
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,140
data that we know that these devices

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,600
will collect in the wild things like

95
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,359
child's location audio recordings

96
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,060
birthdays that are often entered during

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,220
account setup and then as recipients we

98
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,140
we chose manufacturers and third-party

99
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,880
service providers which are actually the

100
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,289
two manufacturers sorry the two

101
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,988
recipients that are explicitly

102
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,969
distinguished in the copper rule as

103
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,000
having a distinct data handling

104
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,190
requirements then and this is another

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,510
distinction from the previous work we

106
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,640
pulled the transmission principles

107
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,520
directly from a cop a six step

108
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,440
compliance plan so these include data

109
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,810
handling requirements like if it's

110
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,560
privacy policy permits it or if its

111
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,840
owner is given

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,580
verifiable consent if it implements

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,400
reasonable procedures to protect the

114
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,919
information collected and others about

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,039
information storage deletion and

116
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,349
collection we also included a no

117
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,960
criteria transmission principle that we

118
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,940
use as a control to see how adding any

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,099
of these requirements from the law end

120
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,550
up changing the expectations that

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,570
parents have around their toys privacy

122
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,030
so once we've collected all of these

123
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,130
lists that were Manly generated of

124
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,590
relevant parameters we can then

125
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,719
programmatically generate all possible

126
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,479
five parameter combinations to come up

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,210
with a long list of information transfer

128
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,000
descriptions to plug into a survey in

129
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,489
vignette format so here we ended up with

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,070
thousand and fifty six questions where

131
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,169
each question proposed one particular

132
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,330
information flow and then asked the

133
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,190
survey respondents how appropriate they

134
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,830
viewed that flow on a five-point scale

135
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,930
in this particular example we're looking

136
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,599
at a toy walkie-talkie that was

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,940
recording the times it was used and

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,710
we're asking you know for the

139
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,630
manufacturer of the third party service

140
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,060
provider how acceptable is that

141
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,310
collection practice this particular

142
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,710
question uses the empty or the no

143
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,680
criteria transmission principle and then

144
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,659
in the following question we have the

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,910
same structure but we fixed the

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,280
recipient as the manufacturer of the

147
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,610
device and now we're asking for how the

148
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,130
appropriateness changes based off of the

149
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,100
criteria of the transmission principles

150
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,110
that we pulled from the law so once we

151
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,510
had generated all of these questions and

152
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,970
put them into a survey format we tested

153
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,200
the survey with cognitive interviews to

154
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,850
make sure that it made sense to

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,250
respondents and to do this we use a

156
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,950
service called user Bob which allows you

157
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,100
to post a survey or a website and then

158
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,380
work crowd workers will review your

159
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,720
service or website provide audio

160
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,610
feedback and you can record their screen

161
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,260
as they go through and do it so we can

162
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,460
watch these videos and we can see if

163
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,169
they're having any issues with

164
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,479
comprehension as they work through the

165
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,919
survey based off of these interviews we

166
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,140
made a few changes to improve

167
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,400
readability and decreased cognitive load

168
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,990
and then we deployed it out to 195 us

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,940
parents with childrens between the ages

170
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,300
of three and thirteen and this is the

171
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,870
largest survey of us parents regarding

172
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,669
privacy of smart toys that we could find

173
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,550
in the literature and we recruited this

174
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:08,549
particular panel of parents through Sint

175
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,610
which is a online service which will

176
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,639
allow you to specify participant panels

177
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,460
that you're interested in and and do

178
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,949
compensation for them accordingly so

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,109
once we have all these responses we end

180
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,030
up with a fairly rich data set because

181
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,060
each question asks about some

182
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,250
combination of the five information flow

183
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,870
parameters and so in order to start to

184
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,400
dig in and figure out what are the

185
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,930
actual things here that are they're

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,210
mattering and that are affecting parents

187
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,120
norms we group all of the survey

188
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,409
responses by various combinations so in

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,479
the first case we would take an

190
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,280
individual parameter I would say okay

191
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,740
here were all the questions that asked

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,869
about information transfers to a devices

193
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,449
manufacturer and then we could do some

194
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,060
statistics and see you know how do those

195
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,760
information flows compare to a different

196
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,130
set which maybe included all of the

197
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,330
transfers to a third party but of course

198
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,580
there's more going on here than just

199
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,229
individual parameter effects there's

200
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,359
really complicated cross parameter

201
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,360
effects that are going on and affecting

202
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,610
how parents are thinking about their

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,760
children's privacy so try to get at

204
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,260
these higher-order interactions we next

205
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,500
looked at pairs of parameters so we

206
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,449
would take all flows that had both to

207
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,610
its manufacturer and also if it's

208
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:26,970
privacy policy permits it and we can do

209
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,130
the same for any pairwise combination

210
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,289
and start as we go through and do these

211
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,409
comparisons to get a sense of you know

212
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,520
where are these interactions between

213
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,500
parameters and between elements in these

214
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,779
vignettes actually influencing parents

215
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,700
norms and finally we can do the same

216
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,409
thing with participant demographics to

217
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,029
see if there are subpopulations of

218
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,339
parents in our study that have

219
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,320
significantly different opinions about

220
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,089
privacy so we might want to look at more

221
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,550
closely and once we've done in these

222
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,620
groups we can compare the acceptability

223
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,310
scores that were given by respondents on

224
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,589
the survey so now once we have done all

225
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,540
that I want to go a little bit into

226
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,269
detail about the results that we

227
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,610
found so first I think it's worth it to

228
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:11,040
take a look at one example of what this

229
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,959
data looks like so this is a figure

230
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,300
pulled from the paper where we have the

231
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,518
acceptability scores of all of the flows

232
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,139
that are grouped by the subject

233
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
attributes and by the transmission

234
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,920
principle so this is a bit of an eye

235
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,130
chart and I'll go into detail about what

236
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,410
we can take away a bit later but for

237
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,130
example the the small box in the heat

238
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,899
map in the upper left corner is the

239
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,720
acceptability score overall respondents

240
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,790
who rated the question of flows that

241
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,089
we're collecting the owners child's

242
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:46,889
heart rate and using a transmission

243
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:48,360
principle about the that the parent had

244
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,769
given consent and so we grouped that

245
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,649
into the notification and consent

246
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:55,199
category so what do we see from looking

247
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,420
at this this graph well first of all

248
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,699
somewhat surprisingly we see that

249
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,649
parents norms are far more in alignment

250
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,380
with Coppa than we expected going into

251
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,449
this study so the two columns that have

252
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,449
highlighted over on the right are the

253
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:11,819
two columns of information flows where

254
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:14,069
either that particular flow was

255
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,319
disallowed by Coppa or it doesn't

256
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:19,979
include any indication of a data

257
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:22,560
handling criteria and for the most part

258
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,079
all of those data collection practices

259
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,849
were viewed as negative on average by

260
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,550
the parents but if you look at the rest

261
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,050
of the flows to the left of the two that

262
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,089
I've highlighted most of them are

263
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,849
positive and all of those included some

264
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,860
sort of mitigating criteria that was

265
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,449
drawn directly from Coppa whether that

266
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,149
was about a privacy policy permitting

267
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,920
the flow the parents being notified the

268
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,410
data being deleted after it was needed

269
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,930
etc and we went into this study really

270
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,790
expecting that even with those criteria

271
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,229
parents would take a fairly hard line

272
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,529
about data collection about their

273
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,949
children and that wouldn't be enough to

274
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,480
have a significant influence on their

275
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,639
perceived appropriateness of the data

276
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
collection and so the fact that we see

277
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:09,240
here that no those those criteria really

278
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,699
do change when compared to the control

279
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,410
how parents reviewing these flows makes

280
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:15,630
us think that you know to some extent

281
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,760
Coppa is move

282
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,820
in the direction that is aligned with

283
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,010
parents ideas even if there are details

284
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,450
about technical implementations or

285
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,270
enforcement problems that may be

286
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,550
preventing it from going as far as they

287
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,260
would like the general spirit of the

288
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,870
things that copy is concerned with is

289
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,980
aligned with the general spirit of

290
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,860
things that parents are thinking about

291
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,870
in terms of their children's data so

292
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,940
that was the the major takeaway from the

293
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,500
study but we also found many other

294
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,550
smaller results that we think are

295
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,070
equally interesting and I'd like to

296
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,630
point out so first of all perhaps

297
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,790
unsurprisingly we found that parents

298
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,770
really disliked targeted ads from data

299
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,189
from their children this particular

300
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,870
column that I've highlighted is about

301
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,400
flows with the transmission principle if

302
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,160
the information is used to serve

303
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,750
contextual ads and contextual

304
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,930
advertising is actually a specific

305
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,030
exemption in Coppa where only a certain

306
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,949
type of information is allowed to be

307
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,230
collected by children for contextual ads

308
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,480
we can see here generally that parents

309
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,080
view advertising based off of their

310
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,880
children's data as unacceptable

311
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,400
we also found in this case I think

312
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,500
someone discouragingly that transmission

313
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,079
principals based off of notification and

314
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,670
consent were more influential than those

315
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,510
based off of confidentiality and

316
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:36,000
security so generally in the in a left

317
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,590
category we have criteria around you

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
know parents being notified before data

319
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,900
is collected parents having given

320
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,030
consent before data is collected or in

321
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,780
the right category we have criteria

322
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,300
around prompt deletion secure storage

323
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:53,970
and encryption although we didn't use

324
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,859
encryption as a word we used some

325
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,750
unreadable transit or something to be

326
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,820
more understandable to parents and and

327
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,920
we found that this was sort of showing

328
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,350
that the emphasis on notification and

329
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,599
consent that has been prevalent not only

330
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,520
in our community but in the news and in

331
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,940
recent regulation like GDP are is

332
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,079
reflected in parents opinions and I want

333
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,990
to make sure that we emphasize that

334
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,810
there's not necessarily a causality

335
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,120
going on there it's just that parents

336
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,189
sort of are still viewing notification

337
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,290
and consent as primarily important even

338
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,790
though we know as a security community

339
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,270
that there are a lot of issues with

340
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,550
existing consent mechanisms especially

341
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,620
privacy policies and repeated request

342
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,010
for consent around technical issues that

343
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:40,490
parents may not understand also we found

344
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,260
that as has been shown in previous work

345
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,240
data collection by first party

346
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,270
manufacturers is viewed as being more

347
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,830
acceptable than by third parties and I

348
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,380
think it's important to point out here

349
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,370
as well that we chose these two

350
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,080
recipients rather than anything more

351
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,000
specific because they're the two

352
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,670
distinctions that Coppa actually makes

353
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,320
and we might say that given that parents

354
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,300
are making a distinction between these

355
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,360
two categories we might want future

356
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,040
regulation to be even more specific and

357
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,110
break down these further because you

358
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,610
could imagine that there could be a wide

359
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,080
difference in the appropriateness of a

360
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,820
particular third party getting

361
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,640
children's information than a different

362
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,930
third party depending on their

363
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,100
interaction with the device and the

364
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,510
purpose to which they're putting the

365
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,740
data to use we also found that parents

366
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,600
self-reported being familiar with Coppa

367
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,510
view the data collection as being more

368
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,970
acceptable we thought a bunch about this

369
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,100
so why that might be the case I don't

370
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,740
think this was not just a small fraction

371
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,570
of the parents around 60% noted they had

372
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,520
at least heard of Coppa in some sense

373
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,649
and we wondered of course at first

374
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,660
whether this was some maybe false sense

375
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,760
of security where they viewed the the

376
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,459
existence of Coppa being in place as

377
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,649
protecting their children's privacy

378
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:53,390
although if you followed any of the news

379
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,529
around smart toys over the past few

380
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,620
years you know that that might not

381
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:59,600
necessarily be the case and then finally

382
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,940
we found that older parents

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,829
overwhelmingly view data collection from

384
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,029
smart toys as being less acceptable and

385
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:07,489
you can see there's a pretty sharp

386
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,860
cutoff between the participant

387
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:14,390
categories of younger than 45 years of

388
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:17,000
age and older than 45 years of age so

389
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,750
once we had taken a look at those

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,730
results we'd like to suggest a few

391
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,550
opportunities for using this method and

392
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,410
applying it to other research projects

393
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,199
in the future so you think we think that

394
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:33,680
this general technique of using CI to

395
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,070
frame surveys in order to compare

396
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,140
regulation versus privacy norms on the

397
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,520
ground it can be fairly effective and so

398
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,980
we'd like to see it applied to other

399
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,949
privacy regulations like HIPAA and for

400
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,570
and GPR and we also think that it could

401
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,819
be useful for people who are drafting

402
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,959
regulation and policy makers to see

403
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,019
whether or not the things that they're

404
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,060
proposing are actually lining up with

405
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,680
the opinions of the people who that

406
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,930
legislation will affect and this could

407
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,149
better inform policymaking in a more

408
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,160
iterative way or than having to wait for

409
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,079
someone like us to do the study after

410
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,730
it's already been in place and then

411
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,010
finally we'd like to repeat studies like

412
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,459
this over time because a lot of times a

413
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,079
regulation is created not necessarily to

414
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:17,149
align with existing norms but to try to

415
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,579
push populations toward viewing

416
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,170
different things as being acceptable so

417
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,300
you could imagine that if we were to

418
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,760
repeat this study a few years from now

419
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,079
after a smart Toys had become more

420
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,899
prevalent we might see that the

421
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,339
overarching population norms have

422
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,829
started to shift one way or the other

423
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:35,389
and would be interesting to see how the

424
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,560
presence of different regulation or

425
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:38,600
different products in the market can

426
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,819
start to move people's expectations on

427
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,680
one way or the other

428
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,660
so just in quick inclusion we use the

429
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,399
survey to compare complet of parents

430
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,469
privacy norms and we found that

431
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,209
generally the data handling requirements

432
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,190
that were put in place by Coppa do

433
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,979
significantly increase the acceptability

434
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,560
of data collection from the toys however

435
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,750
we really want to make the caveat that

436
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,819
there are untested contextual factors

437
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,589
and there are technical specifications

438
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:05,178
that aren't in Capo which we didn't test

439
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,439
and you could imagine could go on and

440
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,569
further strength strengthen the

441
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,610
regulation and last but not least

442
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,609
enforcement matters so no matter how

443
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:15,678
strong copy is on paper if toys aren't

444
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,059
being held to that standard then parents

445
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,890
even though they may think they're

446
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:19,939
protected may not be when they go to the

447
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,880
store to buy things for their children

448
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,790
so thanks for listening I like to take

449
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,870
some questions and if you have any other

450
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,520
interest in work that we've done I

451
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,250
encourage you to go and check out on the

452
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:36,639
website Thanks

453
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,640
[Applause]

454
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,550
hi let me know from Google and thanks to

455
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,190
you for the great talk I have a question

456
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,610
about third party and the notion of

457
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,550
third party both in Copa and in survey

458
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:55,850
respondents sort of perceptions there's

459
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:58,490
this misconception sometimes we see in

460
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,260
the press and in early discourse between

461
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,410
what a third party is between let's say

462
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,780
if I'm a manufacturer and I use AWS to

463
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,130
store my data versus I put a tracking in

464
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,120
my app that will go to the extreme

465
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,560
advertising company what like what does

466
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,530
Coppa mean by a third party in that

467
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,330
context like is is a data processor a

468
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,440
third party and do parents understand

469
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,570
the difference between these two things

470
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,430
on a treaty right so at least in this

471
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,760
context we were interpreting third party

472
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,370
as the manufacturer of the toy so if you

473
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,540
purchased a toy from you know company X

474
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,209
and that was the company that was on the

475
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,159
box that was the first party for the

476
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,440
purposes of this study although you

477
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
raised a very good point about the

478
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,310
diversity of third parties and I would

479
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,290
like to see follow-up studies that make

480
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:45,169
distinctions between like crash

481
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,930
reporting services cloud services data

482
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,030
aggregators I think that some one

483
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,520
problem of going ahead too quickly on

484
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,649
that is that we start to get past where

485
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,420
parents and survey respondents actually

486
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,310
understand what those entities are doing

487
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,690
in the ecosystem and so you'd want to be

488
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,090
careful that you're not asking questions

489
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:05,870
about things that they don't necessarily

490
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,379
understand then trying to infer norms

491
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,270
off of that okay you need attached from

492
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,220
Google thanks also for a really

493
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,889
interesting talk I wanted to ask you

494
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,510
about your observation on the fact that

495
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,280
parents sort of preferred the notice and

496
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,160
consent model to the security things

497
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,340
like retention and deletion and that

498
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,290
sort of stuff so it's my own guess that

499
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,820
that's perhaps because they're less

500
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,310
educated about what those techniques

501
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,050
actually do or why they're useful but

502
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,530
users do usually learn these things over

503
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:38,480
time so I'm wondering if you were able

504
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,010
to break that down by age did you find

505
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,160
the younger parents for a little more

506
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,960
sort of happy or felt good about

507
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,450
deletion and that's what it's not

508
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,580
retention yeah I'm not sure about that

509
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,010
exact pairing offhand but I can I can

510
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,350
check and get back to you offline what I

511
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,070
do think though is that for some of the

512
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,899
questions about security that if the

513
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,179
criteria is not explicitly put in the

514
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,760
description of the flow that parents may

515
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,420
be assuming that some of that already

516
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,950
exists especially when the descriptions

517
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,570
of security get more technical it may be

518
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,430
the parents especially who are reporting

519
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,710
familiarity with Coppa and so they know

520
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,200
there's some government regulation

521
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,600
already in place even if they don't you

522
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,570
know explicitly read that the data will

523
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,060
be protected when it's transferred that

524
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,980
may not make them assume that it is not

525
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:33,520
protected well it's under answer

526
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,520
so thanks thank you Noah okay
