00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,290
hi everybody my name is mr. Elmer ski my

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,590
cybersecurity research read Ben Gurion

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:20,080
University and today I'm going to talk

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,000
about the world of deep fakes for

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,869
medical imagery specifically 3d medical

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,150
imagery so a little background so as

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,580
some of you may not know MRI and CT

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,229
machines produce 3d volumetric images of

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,360
the human body and they're used for a

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:39,069
diagnosing a wide variety of medical

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,769
issues and in the 2016 there are about

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,979
100 million of these scans performed in

13
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:46,989
the US alone so what's the vulnerability

14
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,940
well if you do a quick search on census

15
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,979
that I oh you'll find something like ten

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,620
thousand of these networks exposed to

17
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:55,629
the Internet and as we know that the

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,629
healthcare industry has a quite a poor

19
00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:01,089
security track record and of just an

20
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:01,360
example of that is the several months

21
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,979
ago

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,229
McAfee researchers were able to

23
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,030
infiltrate one of these networks and

24
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,429
download a CT scan to somebody's pelvis

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,530
and then print out a 3d model and the

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,380
reason that that happens is that there's

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,079
a really big lack of internal network

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,658
security on the healthcare side and for

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,969
example you have old software you have

30
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,969
non-existent or improper encryption

31
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:27,038
exposed infrastructure and so on so the

32
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:28,630
threat is that what if an attacker

33
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,159
doesn't just download your data what if

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,920
he actually mini place your data and

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,850
what if he is able to cause some sort of

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,850
an effect to your imagery to cause a

37
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,189
misdiagnosis so our research goals to

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,130
expose validate and help mitigate this

39
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,329
threat but why would an attacker want to

40
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,689
do this well there's a few different

41
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,880
aspects vs. is the psychological aspect

42
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,648
perhaps the attacker is trying to cause

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,089
a political leader to stand down that

44
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,039
rethink is life

45
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,990
there's the monetary aspect think of

46
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,960
insurance fraud if somebody puts in a

47
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,298
small aneurysm into his own scan you can

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,219
then try and claim quality of life

49
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,229
insurance which is very hard to refute

50
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,910
this kind of evidence and there's the

51
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,260
physical aspect the attackers very

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,670
malicious and he wants to cause physical

53
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,380
harm for example in an act of terrorism

54
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,829
so what's the general attack models if

55
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,329
we look at a standard hospital what will

56
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,700
happen is that when the patient will

57
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,250
gets a scan

58
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,079
machine produces a bunch of 2d slices of

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,420
the body and sends that over the network

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
in what's referred to as DICOM format to

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,319
a server called the PAC server then

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
later the radiologist will pull these

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,510
scans write up a report and for that to

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,030
the referring doctor

65
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,739
so our are the initial attack vectors

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,510
really were that at the point where that

67
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,730
data is transferred over the network

68
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,049
towards the PAC server where if the

69
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,819
attacker is able to manipulate the

70
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,739
contents there then he can possibly

71
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:57,298
affect the diagnosis so what are some of

72
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,610
the challenges of the attacker first of

73
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,650
all there's realism so the injected or

74
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,360
removed condition has to do respect

75
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,000
their surrounding Anatomy can't just be

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,829
copy pasted into the image and it must

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,510
be convincing from every single angle it

78
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,370
can't just be that we're editing the 2d

79
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,828
slices because the radiologist will look

80
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,390
at it from every possible angle and then

81
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,920
there's the aspect of complexities so

82
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,869
state of the art Gans can handle

83
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,819
something about 1 million pixels whereas

84
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,569
CT scans and MRI scans have upwards of

85
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,190
600 million voxels and automations so

86
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,000
many radiology networks are actually

87
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,889
air-gapped

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,630
and the diagnosis can actually happen

89
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,310
right after the scan is taken so there's

90
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,430
very little time to tamper so you can't

91
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,810
perform photoshopping and the attack may

92
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,549
need to be actually real time for

93
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,630
example inside the radiologist viewer

94
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,190
itself so in order to show that this

95
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,340
attack is possible we developed this

96
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,230
framework called CT again and we focused

97
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,760
on one particular use case which is lung

98
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,319
cancer so take before we start we have

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,970
to get a data set so this is how we

100
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,440
prepared our data set so we got some

101
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,959
free scans off the internet there's so

102
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,200
many different databases of CT scans we

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,660
use this one called allied DC and once

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,988
we had our data set of scans we use the

105
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,269
annotations to extract cubes of the

106
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,010
areas wherever there was cancer and we

107
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,410
pre processed those cubes by performing

108
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,298
histogram equalization and some

109
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,220
normalization and then we got something

110
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,409
about a very small data set of 600

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,210
samples and because that's way too small

112
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,010
for many deep learning we then did some

113
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,690
augmentation so we did some rotations

114
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,000
and some of the shifts of all the

115
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,110
samples and we got something like 16,000

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,599
samples in total so with this data set

117
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,680
what Mahler did we use we use the custom

118
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,380
3d picks to

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,970
takes Network four in painting and that

120
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,030
works something like this so you have a

121
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,190
generator and you take a sample and you

122
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,039
zero out the center kind of mask the

123
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,289
center with zeros and you have the

124
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,650
generator trying and recreate the center

125
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,599
of that that sample with cancer so this

126
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,460
would work as is as a convolutional

127
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,650
neural network however you get tend to

128
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,180
get some blurry images so what we do

129
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,549
actually we add in this discriminator

130
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,770
and the discriminator is trying to

131
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,270
police the outputs of the generator to

132
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,310
make trying to make sure that those

133
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,090
results look as realistic as possible

134
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,620
and the discriminator gets both the a

135
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,690
sample that is real or fake and the

136
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:24,300
context the surrounding tissue though ie

137
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:27,060
the masked sample so we trained this

138
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,370
framework all together once take four on

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,690
cancer samples only so that's all - the

140
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,820
generator Network only knows how to

141
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,289
complete samples with cancer and then

142
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,360
once again we repeat the entire process

143
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,310
with healthy samples so that we get

144
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,760
another generator that can then try and

145
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,800
remove cancer so how did the entire

146
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,659
process work so when the malware sees

147
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,639
the DICOM file going over the network it

148
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:50,610
checks the meta tags determine if it's

149
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,130
the right target and then X is a very

150
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,349
basic localization algorithm there's

151
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,469
many different algorithms out there for

152
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:00,060
finding candidate locations so it finds

153
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,440
a candidate location for injection of

154
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,630
removal depending what the goal is

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,120
performs all pre-processing steps

156
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,909
interpolation equalization normalization

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,500
masks the center uses the appropriate

158
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:13,229
generator if it's trying to inject or

159
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,090
remove and then reverses the entire

160
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,130
process and the very end we had some

161
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,530
additional noise and Gaussian noise to

162
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,599
try and cover up the interpolation blur

163
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,000
so the radiologist won't see this kind

164
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:30,150
of blurry mark inside the scan and we

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,220
paste it back inside the skin so here

166
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,830
are some sample results so here's for

167
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,009
cancer injection so you can see that on

168
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,330
the right side is the after tampering

169
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,509
and we're just looking at 2d slices

170
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,490
around those cubes and this is for

171
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,240
removal and you can see it does a quite

172
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,860
a good job and this is a 3d view because

173
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,860
again we're working with 3d samples

174
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,980
so for our evaluation we had to make

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,680
sure that the results looked accurate

176
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,130
that it would fool a radiologist so we

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,930
did we took 100 samples and we split it

178
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,620
up as follows in the image tampering

179
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,720
step first we took 35 samples which are

180
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,820
actual or scans I should say that we're

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,680
actually cancers had cancers in the

182
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,810
lungs and we used our algorithm to

183
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,670
automatically remove all the cancer it

184
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,640
could find and then we took an

185
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:26,340
additional 235 scans which were healthy

186
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,099
and we added one or more cancerous

187
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,700
nodules to those scans and then we took

188
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,560
the remaining 30 scans as a baseline for

189
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,360
evaluation we use three expert

190
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,190
radiologists and we use a

191
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,500
state-of-the-art lung cancer screening

192
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:45,360
ai with the same model that won the

193
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,850
kaggle 2017 bowl for evaluation we had

194
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,950
two trials first a blind trial where we

195
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,390
didn't we told the radiologist nothing

196
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,180
about the tampering we just asked them

197
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,820
to diagnose the scans and then we had an

198
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,950
open trial where we told the radiologist

199
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,390
the truth about the scans and we asked

200
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,740
them what did the thing which ones they

201
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:06,450
think have been tampered which ones do

202
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,120
you think are original so for the blind

203
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:12,479
test we found that for injection there

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,600
was about a 99% attack success rate and

205
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,940
for removing cancer 94% attack success

206
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,680
rate and for the AI it failed every

207
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,540
single time whenever we added cancer

208
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,250
remove cancer it thought that this was a

209
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,500
legitimate image and did not to think

210
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,950
there did not miss a sample in any case

211
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,360
and when we asked the radiologist what

212
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,460
they think about those fake samples

213
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,500
again in the blind trial they believed

214
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,390
that mo for most of the fake samples

215
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,640
that they were actually malign meaning

216
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,370
that they require some sort of biopsy or

217
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,180
treatment follow to follow up given

218
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,550
these findings then for the open test

219
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,859
when we reviewed revealed the truth to

220
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,660
the radiologists there was they were

221
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,120
very inconsistent in terms of their

222
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,480
predictions meaning that about somewhere

223
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,490
between 20% accuracy and 60% accuracy

224
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,650
for injecting and removing samples and

225
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,520
they were unable to really differentiate

226
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:08,140
what is a real cancer sample what

227
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:11,319
a fake cancer sample so it's not enough

228
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,360
to say that okay attacker has some scans

229
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,160
he can tamper them real estate fine but

230
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,320
we also have to show that this is an

231
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,209
indeed a threat that an attacker can get

232
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,460
his hands on these scans in order to

233
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,470
manipulate them so in order to prove

234
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,160
this we performed a covert penetration

235
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:30,010
test on an active Hospital so this is a

236
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,209
quick topological view of a hospital I'm

237
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,920
gonna be very brief you can take a look

238
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,810
at our paper for all the different

239
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,150
details on the on the attack surface of

240
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,770
the hospital but you basically look

241
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,390
something like this you have a bunch of

242
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,340
different scanning modalities and

243
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,010
they're connected to these workstations

244
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,680
which are often not X Windows XP

245
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,810
machines and they send the their scans

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,910
in DICOM format over their internal

247
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,199
network to a PACs database and in the

248
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,790
same network you have radiologist

249
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,220
workstations and various other systems

250
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,780
and the pax network this radiology

251
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,250
networks often also connected to the

252
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,770
hospital's network was a connected to

253
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,240
Wi-Fi networks and both these networks

254
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,290
are often also connected to the Internet

255
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,430
for remote access and emails and so on

256
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,140
so you can as you can see quite clearly

257
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,500
there's lots of attack vectors from the

258
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,530
internet from local acts Wi-Fi access

259
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,230
points and of course physical intrusion

260
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,510
as well and we try to demonstrate the

261
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,970
physical side to show how this attack

262
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,040
can be accomplished so to do that we

263
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,950
took a Raspberry Pi and a USB to

264
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,719
Ethernet adapter and we printed out a

265
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,080
Philips label to make it look

266
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,090
inconspicuous and we put on side this or

267
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,830
a spray pie we just simply set it up as

268
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,050
a transparent Network bridge with our

269
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:45,430
malware to intercept any DICOM scan site

270
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,990
we should see so then I went to the

271
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,130
hospital of course with permission but

272
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,040
without let him know that I was coming

273
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,570
and I went in at night so when the

274
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,160
cleaning staff opened the doors and I

275
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,600
walked right in the clean stuff didn't

276
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,219
ask anything they didn't say anything

277
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,490
who walked right past them like I belong

278
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,530
there

279
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,350
and it only took a few minutes to find

280
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,449
the Radiology's workstations right here

281
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,300
and after that only about another few

282
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:11,410
minutes to find at least one of their CT

283
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:15,040
scanners and once I found their CT

284
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:17,379
scanner it took something like about 30

285
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,719
seconds to install the man metal

286
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,910
of ice and because the man middle device

287
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,769
has you know as a Raspberry Pi I also

288
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,549
have an access point now so I was able

289
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:30,359
to go to the the waiting room and then

290
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:33,189
get a complete backdoor into the system

291
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:36,399
so something else I should point out is

292
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:40,539
that not only were after after I planted

293
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,249
this this mana metal device I was I then

294
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,959
revealed it to the hospital and they let

295
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:46,689
me take a few scans to see what I could

296
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,949
see I found that too these scans were

297
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:49,629
actually being sent over the hospital

298
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:51,539
network in plaintext

299
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,189
and through the help of Kim Zetter

300
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,019
journalist I was able to find out that

301
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:57,969
this is actually the case for most many

302
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,559
hospitals in the United States and

303
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,629
around the world that the internal

304
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,098
network is considered safe so they don't

305
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,689
enable encryption but it's not just

306
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:07,329
because it's gonna consider it safe but

307
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:09,339
also because of alternate types of

308
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:13,988
legacy constraints and things like that

309
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:16,839
so this is showing capturing a scan

310
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:19,029
going over the network and even though

311
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,309
it says it's being encrypted with SSL is

312
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,319
all in plain text because otherwise

313
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,749
there other systems wouldn't be able to

314
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,579
read it and then I was able to run the

315
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:29,999
malware and intercept in many playful

316
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:33,368
scans so what are some countermeasures

317
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:35,229
so for prevention we could just simply

318
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:37,359
secure the data in motion we can just

319
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:38,949
simply enable proper encryption over the

320
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:41,319
network and we can at least mitigate

321
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:43,419
this man the middle attack but as I

322
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:45,599
mentioned before many hospitals don't

323
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:48,789
encrypt their internal traffic for

324
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,529
compatibility issues and also we can try

325
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:52,239
and you know bring up staff awareness

326
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,259
let them know that you know don't let if

327
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,939
you see somebody you don't recognize me

328
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,399
be asking what he's doing there and not

329
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,919
letting walk right in and for detection

330
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,049
we can enable digital signatures so in

331
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,429
the DICOM format so there's actually

332
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:05,379
part of the standard is digital

333
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,720
signature so scanners can actually place

334
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,879
a signature on the scans and those can

335
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,319
be verified but as far as I know no

336
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,059
we're in industry they're actually being

337
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:16,059
using this at the in the hospitals

338
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:18,789
themselves and for more advanced methods

339
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,189
we can form watermarking and image

340
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:22,869
temperate detection algorithms however

341
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:25,029
for watermarking is not being used in

342
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:26,439
industry mostly because it affects the

343
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,850
quality of the image and that's of

344
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,150
course you don't want to affect medical

345
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,800
images in any way and for tamper

346
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,449
detection we found that at least these

347
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,400
out these algorithms don't work out of

348
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,140
the box probably because the way the

349
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,540
scans are being generated with this

350
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,910
radial kind of properties so the noise

351
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,699
is different so these algorithms need to

352
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,610
be adjusted in order to work on CT scans

353
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,700
and MRI scans

354
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,850
so in conclusion attackers can inject a

355
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,410
medical evidence into CT and MRI scans

356
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,610
they can do it automatically and

357
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,750
realistically and the attack succeeds

358
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,900
100% of the time against a

359
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,300
state-of-the-art AI and about between 96

360
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,280
and 99 percent of the time of our expert

361
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,620
radiologists we also showed how they

362
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,079
attack is viable and how it can be

363
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,720
mitigated and for a future work

364
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,880
we're also we're looking at how to adapt

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,370
classical image tampering localization

366
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,830
algorithms for radiology imagery and

367
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,230
we're also looking at looking at how we

368
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,090
can use seat again to help train

369
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,490
radiologists for completely benign

370
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:33,340
reasons to help since many do these data

371
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,600
sets have privacy concerns we're using

372
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,370
CT can we can actually generate

373
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,760
potentially infinite data sets for

374
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,320
radiologists to learn from so if anybody

375
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,540
wants to try a check out the code and

376
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,900
our data sets feel free to take a look

377
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,910
at our github page and how much time do

378
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,760
we have left because I have a short demo

379
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,770
I can show two minutes so I'll quickly

380
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,180
try and load up a demo and if some

381
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,730
anybody has questions please feel free

382
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,729
to come up and ask

383
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:14,029
yes so in the u.s. tampering with

384
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,490
medical data like this that might result

385
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:18,889
in death or someone is actually a felony

386
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,860
you can go to jail for a long time isn't

387
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:25,070
it easier to just secure physically the

388
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,320
device the room in which say they are

389
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,800
Marv Iowa's CT scan is rather than doing

390
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:34,220
all this complicated stuff on the wire

391
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,040
that's gonna break usability yeah so

392
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,139
absolutely and well first of all that's

393
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,060
they should definitely be enforcing the

394
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,160
physical security but even if you

395
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,199
enforce physical security you know you

396
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,149
malware can get there you know it's not

397
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,649
just because it's you know somewhat

398
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,389
segregate as we saw there's many there

399
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,320
connect to the internet many times that

400
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,529
doesn't mean you're not going to get

401
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,870
some malware in there and also in some I

402
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,490
know in some countries at least these

403
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,600
scans are actually given to the patient

404
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,889
themselves so they bring it to the

405
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,120
referring doctor so once they have in

406
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:05,959
their hands they can do whatever they

407
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,750
want with them so this is just showing

408
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,209
for example for injecting you can click

409
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:16,360
on random areas I'll take a few seconds

410
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:20,560
to load them all for the first time and

411
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,560
then for removal

412
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,750
this very quickly does anybody have any

413
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,750
other questions

414
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:42,750
here is a good example here after this

415
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,970
is showing you removal as well yeah

416
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,530
anyway yes okay so I said I'm from

417
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,780
suspense thanks for your talk and really

418
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,120
nice results I'm just curious so why do

419
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,209
you need to generate these images why

420
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,270
don't just use some real images with

421
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,430
like cancer or without cancer what do we

422
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,350
need to regenerate them so you're asking

423
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:06,569
like basically why not just Photoshop it

424
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:09,089
just copy paste onto the image exactly

425
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,339
so because many times because the the

426
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:13,800
body has to match up right because the

427
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,069
people have different BM eyes you have

428
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,389
to discern two masts and scales and the

429
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,220
radiologist doesn't just give image and

430
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,080
make a decision she gets all sorts of

431
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,880
other you know information about the

432
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,310
patient and also the referring doctor

433
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,600
gets the scan afterwards and he sits in

434
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,909
front of the patient so if it doesn't

435
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,010
make sense you know that the the size

436
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,020
and the scale of the other individual

437
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:39,540
then there's gonna be a lot of questions

438
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:41,760
raised Thanks very nice work I thought

439
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,500
an interesting result was that the

440
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,290
moment you told the doctors that there

441
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,770
is some susceptibility of things being

442
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,930
fake they became at least based on the

443
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,540
slide very reliable so he seems to me

444
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:57,210
that that itself can be an attack vector

445
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,129
yes yes I mean the main the main concern

446
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,050
there was once after we tell me tell me

447
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,750
when the truth is that we also tell them

448
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,610
we're moving cancer so there it's very

449
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,440
hard because they have to kind of like

450
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,719
maybe look for some artifact some noise

451
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,510
in order to determine their you can have

452
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:18,920
a lot of false positives I also had a

453
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,290
question did you find that some

454
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,580
architectures were more efficient at

455
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,610
like in terms of the generative model

456
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,470
that you're using how did you yeah so we

457
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,020
tried a few different methods the first

458
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,400
one actually we went to a cycle again as

459
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,230
you guys seemed the most natural choice

460
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,630
which cyclic NBC gave it a whole set of

461
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,310
let's say cancer cancerous images and

462
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,320
healthy images and it learns how to

463
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,149
automatically transfer one domain to the

464
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,590
other whereas here we have to train two

465
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,180
separate models on two separate data

466
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,168
sets but we found it didn't work out so

467
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,669
well and I

468
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:50,220
believe the reason was simply because

469
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,440
the amount number of data points we had

470
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,289
we only have 600 positive samples just

471
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,639
really really small so once you try to

472
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:02,690
run cycle again you need a much bigger

473
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:06,320
data set any other questions

474
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:10,630
all right let's thank the speaker again

475
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,629
[Applause]
