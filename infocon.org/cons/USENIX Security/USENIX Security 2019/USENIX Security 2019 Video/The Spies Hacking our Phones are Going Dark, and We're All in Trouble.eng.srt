1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,730
so my name is John Scott Railton I'm

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,169
senior researcher at citizen lab this is

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,210
my colleague Bill Maher's anak senior

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,160
fellow at citizen lab and we're gonna

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,050
give you a presentation today talking

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,880
about how the spies hacking our phones

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,770
are going dark

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,210
so the roadmap for this is super

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,160
straightforward we're gonna talk about

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,810
some players in the spyware industry

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,400
we're gonna talk about how we hunt them

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,290
we're gonna give you some information

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,510
about why we think they're going dark

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,610
we're gonna talk about the narrowing

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,559
knowledge pipe of information about

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,120
these operations and then we're gonna

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,339
say a few things about what we think you

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,870
can do but first we sort of have to

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,719
start with a disclaimer which is when

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,059
you talk about zero days and other sort

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,460
of exotic sexy sophisticated attacks you

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,250
have to remind yourself that for the

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,110
most part most attacks most of the time

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,680
including those targeting high-risk

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,750
groups are really boring they are

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,430
nevertheless effective so in a couple of

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,710
years of looking at all the attacks

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,259
targeting a number of China focus groups

29
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,910
we found one O'Day and I think the

30
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:15,479
analogy that you can keep in your head

31
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:18,330
is that tuberculosis smallpox malaria do

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,580
way out sized harm but much of the

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,520
research focus is on exciting things

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,509
like Ebola so with that disclaimer we're

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,509
gonna talk about Ebola

36
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,030
so some players in this industry um

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,580
well these days there's kind of a large

38
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,979
surveillance industrial complex at the

39
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,780
top end you have sort of large-scale

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,599
data analytics machine learning

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,940
predicting behavior at the Meisel level

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,979
you have data interception and massive

43
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,830
interception and then kind of at the tip

44
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,940
of this upside down pyramid you have

45
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,890
targeted malware and other kinds of

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,009
intrusion which of course is what we get

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,330
to talk about the pitch that companies

48
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,640
that make this kind of targeted malware

49
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,560
say is that criminals and others are

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,599
going dark and that states need some

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,509
kind of ability to chase them down their

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,509
dark hole they sell this kind of

53
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,569
technology at conferences and industry

54
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,819
events around the world and sort of no

55
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,069
matter their name their pitch is

56
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,470
basically the same you've got stuff you

57
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,799
want a hack you have devices you can't

58
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,090
monitor here's a way to get on and it

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,560
used to be the

60
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,030
if you wanted to do this kind of

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,220
sophisticated nation state level

62
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,110
targeted stuff you needed your own STEM

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,209
program you needed to develop your own

64
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,180
endogenous capability that is no longer

65
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,489
true now all you need is a checkbook

66
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,260
right and all of the major exciting

67
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,300
things that we all learned about in 2013

68
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,510
when Snowden did his revelations are now

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,310
available to anybody for a price so with

70
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,500
that I want to give a little example of

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,750
one of these companies and how things go

72
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,220
so wrong

73
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,900
thanks John so one of the companies that

74
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,400
we've you know done a bit of reporting

75
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,010
on its citizen lab is this company

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,540
called cyber bet they're our division

77
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,590
when we did the report at least these

78
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,510
companies are constantly reorganizing

79
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,790
they were division of israeli defense

80
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,709
contractor elbit systems and you can see

81
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,709
here one of their booths at like an ISS

82
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,140
world type conference and what we see

83
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,120
with companies like this is you know

84
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,980
they go off they do these exhibitions at

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,319
ISS world they go and they give

86
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,090
demonstrations in some cases we were

87
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,069
able to identify you know them going to

88
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,530
like use becca stands national security

89
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,018
service and other places which are sort

90
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,940
of a who's who of repressive governments

91
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,470
and the results are fairly predictable

92
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,780
you know they sell this technology to a

93
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,440
government and then we on the citizen

94
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,209
lab side start seeing cases of abuse so

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,060
here you can see some emails that were

96
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,579
received by ethiopian diaspora activists

97
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,650
and the subjects were sort of enticing

98
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,140
them to click on potentially interesting

99
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,690
videos it turns out if they clicked on

100
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,369
the links included in the emails they

101
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,950
were directed to this sort of a fake

102
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,209
video portal that said hey before you

103
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,149
see this video that's really interesting

104
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,010
you need to update your Flash Player and

105
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,840
as I'm sure you can all imagine if a

106
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,608
target click there and download it and

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,950
install the Flash Player their computer

108
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,239
would be infected with spyware in

109
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,959
addition to getting an updated Flash

110
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,790
Player and you know predictably again

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,769
you know this was being used by a

112
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,719
repressive government so of course it

113
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,418
was being used to target journalists and

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,889
dissidents so some targets were

115
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,229
identified and the Oromo community

116
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,840
included duramed who's the head of

117
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,099
Oromia media foundation of ethiopian

118
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,450
diaspora media outlet based in the

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,000
states as well as some academics

120
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,039
interestingly they also sort of targeted

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,419
me in a very sort of crude way I think

122
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,800
because I was corresponding with with

123
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,169
some of these targets

124
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,180
but overall we found around sort of 40

125
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:46,530
cases here of targeting and abuse and we

126
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,810
were able to quantify these targets

127
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,909
trace them across five continents you

128
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,889
know North America Europe Australia

129
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:57,180
Japan etc etc but John is gonna tell us

130
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,879
about something that you might have read

131
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,069
about in today's Wall Street Journal so

132
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,919
ripped directly from this morning's

133
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:10,500
headlines meet a 36 year old musician in

134
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,258
Uganda named Bobby wine Bobby wine is

135
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,870
also a Ugandan Member of Parliament and

136
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,900
observers of Uganda and Ugandans alike

137
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,620
think hey this guy may represent a

138
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,770
credible challenge a popular voice

139
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,360
challenging

140
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:31,080
Uganda's current dick toriel regime well

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,090
as his star was rising so too was the

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,190
Ugandan government's appetite for

143
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,690
information about what mr. Bobby wine

144
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:43,229
was up to so as we learned from today's

145
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,590
Wall Street Journal Bobby wine was

146
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:49,080
targeted by Ugandan security services

147
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,940
using a piece of Israeli made spyware

148
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,300
and after a week of trying for whatever

149
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,000
reason they did not succeed so they

150
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,219
basically wandered across the street to

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,300
a group of huawei techs who were

152
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:03,060
supporting some of their other

153
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,979
interception programs and sat them down

154
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,979
in front of their spyware console and

155
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,909
says guys can you help us out and they

156
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,710
did and the Ugandan government then

157
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:15,779
successfully managed to infiltrate his

158
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,460
phone gain information about the

159
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,949
protests that he was organizing and

160
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,698
arrest him and round up a bunch of his

161
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:25,620
supporters one can only imagine that as

162
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,360
the hawawa techs were sat down in front

163
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,409
of that console they asked if they could

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,779
plug in a USB so the takeaway from this

165
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:36,479
is pretty simple this kind of technology

166
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,610
is extremely exciting to all states and

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,370
in a context where there's not a lot of

168
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,610
oversight it represents an absolutely

169
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,169
impossible to resist temptation for

170
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,909
abuse so we're going to talk a little

171
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,948
bit about how we hunt this stuff and

172
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,300
it's basically a kind of a reciprocal

173
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,949
process

174
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,110
the one hand we spend a lot of time

175
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,900
working directly with high threat

176
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,360
individuals and trying to get from them

177
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,489
the kinds of things that get us started

178
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,020
sometimes that means sitting on their

179
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,789
networks and monitoring the stuff that

180
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,710
comes across them sometimes that means

181
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,780
working with them to proactively

182
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,388
identify suspicious messages and

183
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,619
sometimes that means going back to

184
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,449
groups that we think have been target in

185
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,430
the past and trying to do sort of

186
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,740
wholesale searching for suspicious

187
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,900
targeting on the flip side we do a

188
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,639
series of technical things including

189
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,190
fingerprinting infrastructure analysis

190
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,360
and DNS cache probing and with that I'm

191
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,569
going to turn it over to Bill who's

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,940
gonna talk to you about one such case

193
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:35,849
thanks John so if you have been

194
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,409
following this sort of industry and news

195
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,229
articles for a while you might have been

196
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:42,060
familiar with this case of ahmed mansour

197
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,068
an activist in the UAE or I should say

198
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,990
former activist now serving 10 years in

199
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:47,520
prison for sending out tweets that

200
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,539
criticized the UAE s involvement in

201
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,068
Yemen so in August 2016 he received

202
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,030
perhaps I don't know I don't not sure if

203
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,009
I should say these are like the most

204
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,448
famous text messages ever but but

205
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,849
perhaps pretty close

206
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,460
he received these text messages warning

207
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,009
or purporting to provide information

208
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,739
about new secrets of Emiratis tortured

209
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,419
in in state prisons kind of odd to get

210
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,860
this sort of text from a unknown number

211
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,870
as you can see here but that's exactly

212
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,580
what he got and he thought the link

213
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,909
looked a bit dodgy so he forwarded up to

214
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,068
us for analysis and of course when you

215
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,560
get one of these things especially if it

216
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,539
contains a link these companies that

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,849
provide this sort of spyware are very

218
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,830
cognizant that security researchers like

219
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,690
us are trying to figure out what they're

220
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,939
up to and trying to get you know juicy

221
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,370
stuff from targeting so of course these

222
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,529
links are very you know closely tightly

223
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,719
held and very strongly limited so that

224
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,919
if you click on it once you might get

225
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,419
something interesting but the second

226
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,610
click you don't get anything or there

227
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,730
might be time limited 24 hours after

228
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,399
it's sent out it might get disabled so

229
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,600
of course we clicked on it you know man

230
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,920
in the middle of our traffic so we could

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,649
intercept anything that was downloaded

232
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,689
to the phone and of course what we got

233
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,339
is a chain of three zero day exploits

234
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,890
for the latest version of the iPhone

235
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,800
which Apple did not know about which

236
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,999
enabled the installation of a persistent

237
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,258
door that could access virtually

238
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,959
everything on the phone which we were

239
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:13,050
able to trace back to NSO group in

240
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,339
Israeli spyware vendor and of course you

241
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,649
know as part of this process we work

242
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,050
with Apple disclose the the exploits to

243
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,819
them they issued a patch very quickly to

244
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,170
patch and you know render these

245
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:25,019
vulnerabilities useless for installing

246
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,099
spyware in the future but of course the

247
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,379
story doesn't end there

248
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,809
companies like ans I have hundreds of

249
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,529
employees who are dedicated to

250
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,689
researching and finding new

251
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,819
vulnerabilities and then weaponizing and

252
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:37,799
exploiting them and each time one of

253
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:40,019
these gets founder or you know

254
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,179
discovered the price keeps going up in

255
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,670
the sort of underground exploit market

256
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:48,089
and the pitch here is perhaps best

257
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,979
encapsulated by shell Kiba crier who's

258
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,749
one of these guys that is easily sort of

259
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,319
a marketing guru for this industry and

260
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:56,850
he says hey why would if you're gonna

261
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:58,889
spend and invest all this time and

262
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,689
effort in finding a bug or an exploit in

263
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,819
the iPhone why would you give it to

264
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:05,009
Apple you're gonna get peanuts give it

265
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:07,679
to us and we'll give you a big bounty

266
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,509
not a bug bounty so that's basically how

267
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,480
the marketing in this in this industry

268
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,699
works so obviously when we have one case

269
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,829
like this we want to try and trace it to

270
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:19,319
other cases try and expand out our view

271
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,559
of how the spyware is being used so we

272
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,969
try and do scanning for servers you know

273
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,069
Internet servers associated with the

274
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,629
spyware so what does that mean well

275
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,309
here's how you can think of the

276
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:31,379
architecture of these commercial spyware

277
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,999
solutions you've got you know computers

278
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,399
and phones that might be infected and

279
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,679
the spyware on them is programmatically

280
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,959
exfiltrating information back through a

281
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,759
series of cloud-based proxy servers to

282
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,378
some government agency premises that has

283
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,209
a you know command a control server and

284
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,860
maybe you know a bunch of dudes in a

285
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,179
monitoring center with like 12 plasma

286
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,910
TVs looking through the contents of your

287
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,410
phone and but the point the main point

288
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,149
here is that there's a lot of you know

289
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,649
stuff that's running out there on the

290
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,689
internet that is potentially you know

291
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,389
has a footprint and we can scan and

292
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:01,589
fingerprint so as an example you know

293
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,629
the link that was sent to ahmed mansour

294
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,360
when we clicked on it a second time when

295
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,919
we got this very bizarre decoy page

296
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,660
which is you know sort of two meta

297
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,129
redirects to google it'll kind of looks

298
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,929
like someone sat out at their computer

299
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,269
and type this out so it seemed like it

300
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:17,279
would be a pretty good fingerprint to

301
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:18,630
scan internet for and of course we were

302
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,430
able to use existing

303
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,930
repositories like showdown in census and

304
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,140
do our own sort of scanning for this as

305
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,430
well and enumerate other servers used in

306
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,199
the spyware and this is where it gets

307
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,780
interesting because we had this one case

308
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,860
in the UAE but using this methodology of

309
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,380
scanning and fragrant

310
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,470
we found other domain names which

311
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,970
suggested something interesting going on

312
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,920
in Mexico so as this work was going on

313
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,350
we got contacted by one of our

314
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,819
long-standing organizational partners in

315
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,120
Mexico an organization called

316
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,460
our 3d and they said look we have the

317
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,760
sense that weird things are happening to

318
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,170
a bunch of different folks in Mexico

319
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,150
journalists activists opposition

320
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,680
politician groups are all saying they're

321
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,170
getting weird messages and they think

322
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,630
something may be going on let me

323
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,510
introduce you to one such case Xavier

324
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,790
Valdes was a journalist and the

325
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,540
publisher of a small newspaper in

326
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,730
Sinaloa called Rio Doce and his

327
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,310
newspaper was distinguished because it

328
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,130
was really good at rooting out

329
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,949
corruption and links between the Mexican

330
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,939
government and cartels and organized

331
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:33,150
crime for his trouble Xavier Valdes was

332
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,370
assassinated as he left his work in 2017

333
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,860
and after being dragged into the street

334
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,930
his mobile phone and laptop were taken

335
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,720
from the scene and his killers fled

336
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:49,079
almost immediately after his death his

337
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,510
colleagues at Rio Doce began getting

338
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,220
text messages and the text messages

339
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,319
which of course were infection attempts

340
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,570
promised them information about the one

341
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,310
thing they wanted to know the most who

342
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,000
had just killed their colleague and

343
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:06,510
friend but it didn't end there here's

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,330
his fiancee Griselda tranya a journalist

345
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:12,000
in her own right and not long after his

346
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,300
killing she was also sent information

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,850
again promising information about the

348
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,660
death of her loved one and again these

349
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,690
were exploit links when we started

350
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,719
looking at Mexico we discovered an

351
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:31,560
absolute bucket load of targeting with

352
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,100
Pegasus spyware we found that every

353
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,930
second

354
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,490
we could think of from people

355
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,579
investigating the murder and

356
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,460
disappearance of dozens of Mexican

357
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,860
students to opposition politicians to

358
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,900
advocates for a tax on soda beverages

359
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,120
had all been targeted with this pretty

360
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,370
sophisticated piece of nation state

361
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,310
spyware and I would just say watch this

362
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,570
space for more cases like this from that

363
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,750
bill's gonna talk to us a little bit

364
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,110
about cash probing thanks John so one

365
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,340
other way that we can sometimes identify

366
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,410
locations of targets or even specific

367
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,050
victims is by using a measurement

368
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,550
technique called DNS cache probing and a

369
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,870
lot of you might be familiar with sort

370
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,540
of I guess this was the first major

371
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,630
paper that was published on it and the

372
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,400
idea is you send will so one idea of DNS

373
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,220
cache probing as you send quote-unquote

374
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,350
non recursive queries to caching name

375
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,910
servers and you see if a domain name is

376
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,830
in the cache you probe for specific

377
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,110
domains and if the domain name is in the

378
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,450
cache it means someone else using that

379
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,630
caching name server has looked it up so

380
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,760
if you imagine like an infected phone

381
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,550
infected with NSO's Pegasus spyware it

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,590
might be sending queries to its ISPs

383
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,030
name servers looking up a domain name

384
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,250
for a command-and-control server let's

385
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,100
say you know sending normal recursive

386
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,140
queries getting responses and then the

387
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,520
ISPs DNS server would cache the fact

388
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,760
that this domain was looked up with an

389
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,100
Associated TTL so then us as researchers

390
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
make the observation that well you know

391
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,830
you can't really directly probe a lot of

392
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,020
these ISP name servers anymore why well

393
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,670
you know some ISPs I guess are getting

394
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,560
more security conscious and saying well

395
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,140
look having these open name servers is

396
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,760
potentially bad for you know DNS

397
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,540
amplification DDoS attacks and things

398
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,310
like this

399
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,560
so we're not going to allow people from

400
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,630
outside the ISP to query the name

401
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,160
servers but it turns out that across

402
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,720
thousands and thousands of autonomous

403
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,819
systems on the internet there are these

404
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,560
devices that are DNS forwarders and you

405
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,470
can you know use these to launder your

406
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,670
queries to the ISPs DNS servers you

407
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,220
might not be able to create directly

408
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,170
they will forward in many cases these

409
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,460
non recursive queries to see if

410
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,439
something's in the cache to the caching

411
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,020
name server and you know you get back a

412
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,910
response and you say oh well someone on

413
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,990
this is P is is probably infected so

414
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,819
just to give you a sense the fizzies

415
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,100
actually feasible impossible you can

416
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,470
read the full details on our citizen lab

417
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,000
report club hide and seek there's about

418
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,529
three and a half million ipv4 is

419
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,050
returning a correct response for a

420
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,850
recursive query about 1.7 million of

421
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,920
them have Google in the cache and Google

422
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,089
here is just used as you know well if it

423
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
doesn't have Google in the cache is

424
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,290
anyone really using this name server for

425
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,959
anything interesting there's about 1.2

426
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,390
million that appear to honor your choice

427
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,579
to send it a non recursive query and

428
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,770
about there's about 5,000 a SMS

429
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,160
in sort of classified as sort of access

430
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:24,120
transit a SMS meaning likely to be ISPs

431
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,520
which are you know probable by this by

432
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,500
this sort of technique so we actually

433
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,329
ran this for a bunch of the pegasus

434
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,430
domain names we found and lo and behold

435
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,050
we found infections and I don't know I

436
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,000
think 45 countries or something like

437
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,979
that and you can sort of see you know

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,020
whirring clusters in in sort of

439
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,260
repressive repressive areas and a lot of

440
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,260
activity as well in in Israel where the

441
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,020
company is based in some cases though

442
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,689
you know we can actually identify real

443
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,660
people who are targeted just from these

444
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,670
from these DNS cache groping results so

445
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,010
this brings us to a really interesting

446
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,339
case of Saudi Arabia and a dissident

447
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,930
named as Omar Abdul Aziz so we were able

448
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,910
to filter out some of these Pegasus

449
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,069
servers which appear to be being used by

450
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,870
the Saudi government to target people

451
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,119
around the world we found Saudi linked

452
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:13,829
you know DNS cache probing hits in 12

453
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,599
countries including most interestingly

454
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:21,780
on to ISPs in Montreal Videotron a home

455
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,000
ISP and risk an educational

456
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,740
institutional ISP and at universities

457
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,329
there and what was interesting is you

458
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,830
know when we were seeing things on video

459
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,909
Tron we weren't seeing them on risk when

460
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,379
we were seeing them on risk we weren't

461
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,809
seeing them on video Tron suggesting a

462
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,970
single infection so we sought out to

463
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:37,740
find Saudi dissidents in Montreal whose

464
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,179
pattern of life matched these you know

465
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,000
movement between these ISPs at very

466
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,460
distinctive hours and we found one guy

467
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,350
Omar Abdul Aziz who was both a prominent

468
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,179
Saudi activist whose family had been

469
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,370
threatened and arrested based in

470
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,140
Montreal but also had a very interesting

471
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,360
explanation for why he was you know

472
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,010
travelling between these two ISPs at odd

473
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,110
hours which was he would work from home

474
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,520
during the day and go work out at the

475
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,830
University gym in the evening

476
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,780
which matched our DNS cache program

477
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,340
results and lo and behold we examined

478
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,530
his phone and found a sort of telltale

479
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,409
text message that contained a link to a

480
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:13,110
pegasus domain and it was proposing as a

481
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,730
DHL shipment notification he received

482
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,030
this right after he apparently ordered a

483
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,770
a tub of protein powder on Amazon so he

484
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,460
thought it was legit and remembers

485
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:25,139
clicking on this link so how do we you

486
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,030
know just taking back a stuff how do we

487
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,130
know that this is all linked to NSO

488
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,510
group well one of the things we do when

489
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,100
we're scanning you know this

490
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,320
infrastructure over time as we monitor

491
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,149
it for changes in behavior obviously if

492
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,189
we come out and say hey we detected all

493
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,990
this NSO group infrastructure they are

494
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,460
going to tweak their stuff so we you

495
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,140
know in the hope that we can't detect it

496
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,420
but if you look at sort of the lineage

497
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,920
of this over time you see significant

498
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,110
overlaps in the infrastructure because

499
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,580
let's face it if you're a company and

500
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,290
you've got dozens of customers around

501
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,389
the world running production systems

502
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,159
it's kind of hard to like roll that over

503
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,140
all at once in a way that there's no

504
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,700
overlap so that's definitely you know

505
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,500
provides a window into continued

506
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,000
tracking so we published a report about

507
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,720
the OMA abdulazeez case on October 1

508
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,820
last year October 2nd Jamaal keshavjee

509
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,860
was killed in the Saudi consulate in

510
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,240
Istanbul and it turned out that Jamal

511
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,699
and Omar had been working very closely

512
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,200
together while you know Omar's phone was

513
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,390
under surveillance one of their

514
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,620
initiatives was dawn democracy for the

515
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,140
Arab world now which the Saudi

516
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,260
government likely saw as an attempt to

517
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,260
spark a second Arab Spring in Saudi

518
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,809
Arabia but you know it's not always this

519
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,250
easy to detect you know and identify

520
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,600
these infection attempts and John's

521
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,770
going to talk a bit about some problems

522
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,678
we're encountering now so one of the

523
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,840
neat things about the past few years of

524
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,760
citizen lab research is that a lot of

525
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,309
the pieces of targeting that we have

526
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,220
been looking for are observable to take

527
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:54,059
the form of messages and links and have

528
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:56,820
an element of social engineering the

529
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,860
problem that we are facing is that

530
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,620
increasingly at the high end of

531
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,178
companies selling these technologies the

532
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,820
companies themselves are selling

533
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,320
techniques that are going dark folks are

534
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,550
probably familiar with the reporting

535
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,950
earlier this year about NSO's use of a

536
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,280
vulnerability and how what's

537
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:19,160
connected calls to target a bunch of

538
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,370
folks this is a really good example of

539
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,100
this problem because that targeting was

540
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,129
of course for the most part unobservable

541
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,409
both to the victims and to us but it's

542
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,990
not just vulnerabilities in whatsapp

543
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,360
that are used for no click no user

544
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,820
interaction targeting we've also seen

545
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,149
cases of these companies selling

546
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:45,379
vulnerabilities against iMessage the use

547
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,760
of ss7 as a delivery modality for 0

548
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,300
click no user interaction

549
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,610
vulnerabilities and a lot of network

550
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,230
injection again used for the same

551
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,919
technique put something on a device

552
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:01,240
escalate privilege and compromise so

553
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:06,650
here's an example the UAE government

554
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:10,100
hired a group of ex NSA spooks to

555
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,720
develop their own cyber capability in a

556
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,320
project that was exposed earlier this

557
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,190
year called Project Ravan and as part of

558
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,669
that they rolled an iMessage

559
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,110
vulnerability we now know not from any

560
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,090
technical observations conducted by

561
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,169
anybody publicly at the time but because

562
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:32,629
of leaks from the actual operation that

563
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:35,680
the targets included a clutch of

564
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:40,430
journalists who the UAE viewed as

565
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,160
opponents we also know that in the case

566
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,350
that we have reported so far where the

567
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:50,180
whatsapp vulnerability was used the

568
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,490
victim was actually a lawyer whose

569
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,080
connection we were observing and we were

570
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,360
observing his connection because his

571
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,679
phone had been behaving in a really

572
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,719
strange way he was waking up in the

573
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,040
middle of the night to a phone call not

574
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,570
about you I turn off my phone at night

575
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,770
but he didn't so he'd wake up in the

576
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,370
middle of the night and he'd kind of

577
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:13,310
groggily see like a missed call and then

578
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,620
he'd float back to sleep and he'd wake

579
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,290
up and he'd check his phone and the call

580
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,330
log was gone so he's getting these weird

581
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,610
phone calls from Nordic countries in the

582
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,100
middle of the night and then nothing

583
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,669
well we actually observed one of these

584
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,340
weird strings

585
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,910
phone calls we observed it after

586
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,560
whatsapp had begun silently blocking the

587
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,570
vulnerability and we determined that

588
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,800
this was in fact an infection attempt

589
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,290
and we believe that the reason why he

590
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,899
was getting successive calls actually

591
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,110
points to a new TTP of these operators

592
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,820
which is get on smash-and-grab get as

593
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,429
much as you can pull logs pull

594
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,919
credentials pull tokens and then leave

595
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,960
and if you need more stuff reinfect

596
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,300
later which of course is a smart

597
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,390
approach especially if you're targeting

598
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,610
the lawyer who is representing victims

599
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,440
of your spyware in this case the lawyer

600
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,929
who preserve prefers us not to name him

601
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,180
is actually the lawyer representing a

602
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,640
group of Mexicans who were victims of

603
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:15,000
NSO spyware as well as Omar Abdulaziz a

604
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,320
victim of NSO spyware pretty remarkably

605
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,900
cowboy thing to target that person the

606
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,370
problem is because of this thing which

607
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,860
were sort of calling spyware it going

608
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,469
dark it's almost impossible at this

609
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,570
point for us to get anything like a

610
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,850
visibility of the scale of the problem

611
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,850
in the cases of Mexico that we talked

612
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,490
about before we cast a wide dragnet over

613
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,830
more than a year and talked to hundreds

614
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,660
of people looking for these messages and

615
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,120
we were able to get if not a complete

616
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,950
picture at least a picture the problem

617
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,870
with a lot of this no user interaction

618
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,360
no click stuff is that it's almost

619
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,949
impossible for us as researchers since

620
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,929
we don't have any kind of global network

621
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:59,190
visibility to watch the infection

622
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,560
process happen which gets us to this

623
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,750
observation which is the market for this

624
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,870
kind of technology is obviously growing

625
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,330
but the number of cases that we know

626
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,040
about is only inching up the clearest

627
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,080
example I think of the fact that

628
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,730
something is wrong which gets us to the

629
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,770
problem of the narrowing knowledge pipe

630
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,660
about this stuff more broadly so we

631
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,370
aren't the only people who are looking

632
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,610
at these cases the cyber security

633
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,840
industry is absolutely interested in

634
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,740
tracking these sort of sexy interesting

635
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,750
zero-day based commercial spyware

636
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,810
vendors the problem is that even when

637
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,270
they do publish either privately to

638
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:39,179
subscription clients or publicly they

639
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,410
have very little incentive to actually

640
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,870
go tell the victims

641
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,490
that they were targeted there's a lot of

642
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,439
risk there's a lot of legal downside

643
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,840
they have complicated market positions

644
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,720
and ultimately the result is that we

645
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,730
learn a lot from commercial players

646
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,830
about some of these cases but we miss

647
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,510
real knowledge about what harm is going

648
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,510
on and what abuses are happening

649
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,100
meanwhile major platforms who are

650
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,010
increasingly seeing this stuff as it

651
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,260
transits across their platforms are in

652
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,660
kind of a tricky situation they want to

653
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,930
block it which is great they don't want

654
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:16,040
to show their hand to the operators who

655
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,730
they're blocking where possible and

656
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,010
wherever possible

657
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,710
they're trying not to add too much

658
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,800
oxygen to the public narrative around

659
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,810
vulnerabilities on platform even when

660
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,399
they are notifying users that they may

661
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,440
have been targets of nation-state

662
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,770
operations they typically don't tell

663
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,350
users who or what message or what vector

664
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,590
or when or whether that thing was

665
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:43,949
successful meanwhile government and

666
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,449
military also observing these cases from

667
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,910
all sorts of different vantage points

668
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,770
from global network level to more local

669
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,060
levels and maybe some other people are

670
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,340
occasionally targeted with this stuff

671
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,050
but problem there is that for the most

672
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,870
part those governments really are not

673
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,550
that interested in pointing the finger

674
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,459
for a lot of interesting and not very

675
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,590
surprising political reasons it's also

676
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,600
our observation that we think at this

677
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,300
point that many governments actually

678
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,100
appreciate some of the obscurity around

679
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,149
the spyware marketplace because they

680
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,939
want to be able to play in that space

681
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,400
and source to it - that may be a

682
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,470
national security priority the problem

683
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,240
is its resulting in a lot of lack of

684
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,860
knowledge for the rest of us about

685
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,200
what's actually happening and a lot of

686
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,899
abuses that go largely unrecognized and

687
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,640
unpunished of course each one of these

688
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,750
players if you talk to them you don't

689
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,370
have to talk too long before they

690
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,730
explain that it's kind of the other

691
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,790
guy's problem and it gets more

692
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,190
challenging as we're looking for zero

693
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,379
click no user interactions stuff we as

694
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,110
researchers have real problems with

695
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,910
device forensics of course there are

696
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,679
lots of realities that everyone in the

697
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,840
room is familiar with for why devices

698
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,760
are closed the way they are the problem

699
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,320
is that puts us as

700
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,450
Searchers in a really difficult position

701
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,429
when it comes to getting evidence and

702
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,350
the way that we have largely solved that

703
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,270
problem in the past is to look for the

704
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,070
targeting because at least then we can

705
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,510
say this person was a target in many

706
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,460
jurisdictions that's already illegal

707
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,590
that's already a problem but if we can't

708
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,490
see the targeting and it's fiendishly

709
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,590
difficult

710
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,540
we can't even maybe find a JTAG port in

711
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,580
a phone or gain access to a closed

712
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,540
ecosystem where are we gonna find this

713
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,570
stuff how are we gonna keep learning

714
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,210
about it so we're doing our best we

715
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,159
think with a lot less all right

716
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,030
pivoting to things that we think you can

717
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,350
do if you are the industry or government

718
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,060
and you have a problem you have an

719
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,740
entire ecosystem presenting exciting

720
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,100
opportunities to solve the problems

721
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,410
right

722
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,449
vendors are full of solutions for these

723
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,470
players if you're in civil society if

724
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,580
you're a journalist if you're an

725
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,070
activist if you're a member of an

726
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,649
opposition political group your solution

727
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,990
is really pretty thin not only can you

728
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,310
largely not afford any of that stuff but

729
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,920
the stuff that winds up getting tried

730
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,929
often doesn't work so one thing that's

731
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,760
been tried is to do trainings and

732
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,950
awareness-raising right we write our

733
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,050
reports people talk about them there's a

734
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,390
simple problem though which is that it

735
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,080
takes almost no time for attackers to

736
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,360
change tactics and it takes a long time

737
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,730
to change user behavior right the real

738
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,649
talk is that behavior at least until we

739
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,440
arrive at the matrix is largely unpatch

740
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,840
Abal um there's also not much that users

741
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,420
can do about zero day attacks we were

742
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,850
extraordinarily lucky that the lawyer

743
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,900
who is targeted had this vigilance and

744
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,360
didn't just decide that he was going

745
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,180
bananas about these late-night calls but

746
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,590
actually talked to us about them okay so

747
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,620
things that folks in the room can

748
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,760
actually do first thing first chase the

749
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,070
harm right

750
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,740
these attacks are interesting they're

751
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,679
complicated but the way that we have

752
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,660
found out about them is not by trying to

753
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,580
chase the most technically esoteric

754
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,010
interesting stuff we're looking for

755
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,290
cases where we can find real people who

756
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,540
have experienced real harm and I submit

757
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,100
to you that that winds up getting us the

758
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,010
bonus of some of the most interesting

759
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,679
stuff we get there because we work with

760
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:07,320
these civil society groups and we

761
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,590
endeavor to communicate in ways that

762
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,899
they

763
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,580
understand one of the big problems with

764
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,960
that trifecta that I mentioned earlier

765
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,520
is that none of those players not

766
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,409
industry not platforms not government's

767
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,629
are communicating about these threats in

768
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:21,360
ways that anybody except for maybe the

769
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,860
folks in this room can really parse it's

770
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,510
a little bit like trying to do Public

771
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,279
Health by publishing academic papers

772
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,020
right the people who know it's a problem

773
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,669
are gonna nod sagely and the people who

774
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,570
are getting infected with things are not

775
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:32,929
even gonna know where to find the

776
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,149
journal article

777
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:38,100
protip a lot of this stuff looks boring

778
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,399
at first many of the cases that we

779
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,309
presented to you today begin by kind of

780
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,770
boring mundane high human transaction

781
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,750
cost work with targeted groups but it is

782
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,149
through that work over time and with

783
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,429
persistence that we eventually find the

784
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:56,340
interesting stuff the way that you get

785
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:58,649
there is by good two-way partnerships

786
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,539
because civil society groups are so

787
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,850
heavily targeted by governments and

788
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,950
because governments see them as like a

789
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,990
core part in many cases of their

790
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,610
targeting blend interesting stuff is

791
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,340
going to be pointed in their direction

792
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,539
the challenge is as researchers if you

793
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,699
want to go and work with those groups

794
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:18,899
it's extremely important to be fair and

795
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:22,169
be mindful of reciprocity now getting a

796
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:23,100
little bit more concrete here we

797
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,750
actually think that there are

798
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,830
researchers including it use necks who

799
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,940
are doing awesome

800
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:33,000
work on this problem set Rosener and

801
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,440
McGregor are doing amazing work on the

802
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,390
kinds of risks that journalists and

803
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,779
others face and we think that there's a

804
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,360
huge opportunity space for more exciting

805
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:44,399
and engaging work exactly like this that

806
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,610
you can deploy based on the skill sets

807
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,989
that you have right so you want to

808
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,309
volunteer right maybe you don't want to

809
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,690
do this as academic research maybe you

810
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:55,230
want to do this in a more mundane way

811
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,340
this is also eminently possible but part

812
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,480
of the challenge that goes through

813
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,129
anybody's head when they think about

814
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,049
volunteering is my god I don't

815
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,700
necessarily have a lot of time how do I

816
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:04,500
interact with these groups right maybe I

817
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,779
do social things in software rather than

818
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,669
Hardware how am I going to have these

819
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:11,760
relationships well the good news is

820
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,409
there are plenty of intermediary groups

821
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,960
who if you're interested in this kind of

822
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:18,720
thing are interested in you furthermore

823
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,159
there are lots of ways to accommodate

824
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,860
that within your existing professional

825
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,270
risk

826
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,149
on civilities whether it's your

827
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:28,059
equivalent of 20% time or other kinds of

828
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,670
volunteer work and finally it's possible

829
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:32,260
if you're a company in you're a vendor

830
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,510
to provide direct support to these

831
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,030
groups in a way that's meaningful if

832
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,530
this kind of thing interests you bill

833
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,670
and I will be hanging out up here we've

834
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,500
got stickers and we've got

835
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,200
recommendations if you want to go talk

836
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,070
to specific people finally Bill's gonna

837
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,690
talk about one other thing here yeah so

838
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,340
um some of you might have heard of this

839
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,720
initiative we have at Berkeley called

840
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:56,580
citizen Commack so it's sort of like I

841
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,960
guess a a practical counterpart

842
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,540
practitioner counterpart to citizen lab

843
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,299
so rather than you know doing you know

844
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,280
super hardcore academic research or you

845
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:08,139
know really technical stuff citizen

846
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,720
clinic is you know sort of takes a page

847
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,179
from the legal clinic model and tries to

848
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,460
get advanced undergraduate and you know

849
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,919
masters and PhD students involved

850
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,620
directly in providing cybersecurity

851
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,120
advice you know capacity-building the

852
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,799
sort of you know quote unquote boring

853
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,959
stuff like you know helping under

854
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,660
research under-resourced organizations

855
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,640
set up to FA do a device audit of their

856
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,590
network basically the sort of basic

857
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,660
stuff that you know they simply don't

858
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,879
have the capacity or the money to go out

859
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,280
and pay someone else to do and the hope

860
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,620
is that also you know this will sort of

861
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,750
build a talent pipeline going into

862
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,270
industry going into academia people who

863
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,470
have experience working with and

864
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,750
building trust with these sorts of

865
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,700
groups and can then go and sort of

866
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,590
influence their their future careers or

867
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,740
future academic pursuits to try and get

868
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,360
more you know more focus both in

869
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,640
industry and academia on this topic as

870
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,399
an academic in computer science who

871
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,380
works on this topic you know it is

872
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,870
somewhat frustrating I have to say that

873
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,750
you know it's it's sometimes kind of

874
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:12,459
challenging to get you know traditional

875
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,610
sources of academic research funding and

876
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,679
computer science to focus on this work

877
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,030
you know these you know things that we

878
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,919
the sort of things that we present are

879
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,570
sort of very interesting case studies

880
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,419
that that many people would I'm sure

881
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,860
love to read about in magazines or blogs

882
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:29,890
but you know I think it's it's important

883
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,629
as well to remember that the part of the

884
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,309
cycle of you know uncovering these new

885
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,480
cases and uncovering these new

886
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:36,639
techniques and shrining

887
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,190
light on this this growing new problem

888
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,799
space is absolutely you know applying

889
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,230
rigorous technical methods from the

890
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,460
academic community to do this sort of

891
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,470
problem and I think there's a lot of

892
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,090
interesting research to be done and to

893
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:54,429
be funded here in in computer science as

894
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:56,889
well so with that I guess we'll conclude

895
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:58,600
and thank a bunch of people that that

896
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,000
helped us out including you know one of

897
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,918
the things as a target you have to

898
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,630
imagine it's it's very very tough to

899
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:06,760
make the decision to go public what if

900
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,290
people say oh this person's hacked

901
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,869
we'll never trust them again and so

902
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,500
there's definitely risks to going public

903
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:14,109
potential retaliation from the

904
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,810
government also the NGOs that helped us

905
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:20,139
investigate a lot of these cases are 3d

906
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,668
social atiek article 19 and our awesome

907
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:26,230
collaborators and colleagues citizen lab

908
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:30,210
and it EXCI yeah i think i think we'll

909
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,210
be happy to take any any questions

910
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:41,549
great so we've got a lot of time for

911
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:44,220
questions and I'm gonna start off with

912
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:46,768
one so that while people are lining up

913
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,569
the microphone so how do we how do we

914
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:51,598
actually fix this awareness is a great

915
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:53,549
start turning to the government's to fix

916
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,260
it you've explained they're uninterested

917
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,690
in fixing it let the market decide

918
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,609
doesn't seem like it's working what is

919
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,289
the tipping point look like so we do a

920
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:03,480
lot of awareness we get a lot of people

921
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:04,859
volunteering in civil society what does

922
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,529
it look like when we're actually

923
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:14,130
starting to fix it um yes so there's I

924
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:16,380
think sort of the unfortunate status quo

925
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,119
of where we are right now is that you

926
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,859
know a lot of this in terms of raising

927
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,720
awareness about this stuff and and you

928
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,700
know providing the ammunition for addict

929
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,019
advocacy efforts is basically our

930
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,848
research and the research of others who

931
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:30,180
work in this space and you know we've

932
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:31,769
seen attempts both on you know sort of

933
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,450
attempts from civil society to push for

934
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,879
greater government regulation on these

935
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:40,169
companies in terms of export controls to

936
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,359
push for you know the people who are

937
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,000
funneling money into these industries to

938
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:46,348
perhaps be more cautious about you know

939
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,670
funding these sorts of companies because

940
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,619
I mean let's face it they are kind of

941
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,079
risky investments if you know you send

942
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:53,460
one text with months or one missed call

943
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,250
to a lawyer and suddenly you're whole

944
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,660
you know stack and exploits gets burned

945
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,930
so I think that's sort of the status quo

946
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,700
I think it would be you know there sort

947
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,589
of needs to be a response from sort of

948
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,480
all quarters of society it's not just

949
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:08,130
like a tech and government response it's

950
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,230
not purely an investor response I think

951
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,039
you know the philosophy that I always

952
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:15,059
try and articulate is it's sort of about

953
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,130
mapping out the different actors in this

954
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:18,930
space and trying to convince each actor

955
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,099
let's say investors let's say government

956
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,359
let's say the companies let's say the

957
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:23,730
governments that it's in their interest

958
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,069
to not employ these technologies to

959
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,660
target civil society because if they get

960
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:30,390
caught and their stuff gets disclosed

961
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,819
it's bad for for everyone there's in big

962
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,400
monetary costs there's costs like you

963
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:36,930
know if if the you know the the UAE

964
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,970
government screws up and you know the

965
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,009
the mi5 or something is also using this

966
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,558
and their capabilities gone too because

967
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:45,359
the exploits were patched in the UAE you

968
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,799
know it's sort of thinking about trying

969
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,509
to convince each of these players that

970
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:49,860
there is you know a lot of risk

971
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:51,390
associated with this behave

972
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,420
and try and convince them to sort of

973
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,160
rain again any other thoughts yeah yeah

974
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,990
but great answer I think we should um

975
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,790
turn to some of the growing line of

976
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:05,160
questions here okay so there are a

977
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,930
number of notorious hacking groups out

978
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,720
there that sell their wares all

979
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,600
throughout the world your presentation

980
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,399
focused mostly on NSO and I was

981
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,069
wondering is it particularly egregious

982
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,350
in in the conduct you've seen or is it

983
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,630
just where you spent your time or I

984
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,700
think the simplest answer to that is

985
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,230
that um we've spent a lot of time

986
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,490
looking at targeted malware players and

987
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,580
part of what we are probably picking up

988
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:34,919
on is NSO's growing market dominance a

989
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,290
couple years ago we were maybe looking

990
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,840
at hacking team and finfisher in some of

991
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:42,960
these countries now we're seeing a lot

992
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,760
more of this particular player to me

993
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,660
that's partly a market reality it's

994
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,610
partly also the case that you know when

995
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,009
we looked at some initial NSO stuff

996
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,990
right we started looking at cases and

997
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,030
pretty soon we found more cases and

998
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,819
pretty soon lawyers representing the

999
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,460
victims of the first cases got targeted

1000
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,170
again so you know I think we're kind of

1001
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,900
in an interesting situation what I would

1002
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:09,060
say though is that the industry is large

1003
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,680
and much larger than the research that

1004
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,570
we've got and the thing that drunk

1005
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,210
frankly the thing that drives me bananas

1006
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,310
is that there aren't more researchers

1007
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,920
looking at this and as a result the

1008
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:22,500
public narratives end up attaching

1009
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,880
themselves to the most salient players

1010
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,890
and there's a little bit of an arc right

1011
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,150
like typically when we originally find a

1012
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,710
case like whether it's hacking team or

1013
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,030
finfisher or what-have-you

1014
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,170
the company will sort of start by

1015
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,440
denying and then they'll be like wait a

1016
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,630
minute

1017
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,150
we'd like to sell our story to the press

1018
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,590
and then they start doing that and that

1019
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,750
spectacularly backfires and they get a

1020
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,550
lot of attention NSO is clearly in

1021
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,430
somewhere along the spectacular back

1022
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,630
firing of PR strategy arc but you know

1023
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,120
there are other players out there that

1024
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,220
we don't see and the unfortunate reality

1025
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,230
is that policy makers and others don't

1026
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,689
even know what those players are as well

1027
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,800
and so the narrative and the process

1028
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:02,660
gets a bit skewed but thanks for your

1029
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:05,630
question hello my name is Bobo

1030
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,009
hi I've spent the last year working on

1031
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,519
attempting to prevent the use of

1032
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:12,759
Facebook to incite mass violence it's

1033
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,470
been a very challenging space to work in

1034
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:17,569
I'm hugely appreciative of the work that

1035
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:21,078
you guys do and I know that it's also a

1036
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:23,079
challenging space to work in I've become

1037
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,099
more curious about some of the targeted

1038
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,839
instances of violence or surveillance

1039
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:29,150
such as the stuff that you guys work on

1040
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,420
and I wanted to ask a somewhat naive

1041
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:35,329
question around discoverability in sort

1042
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,920
of two ways I'm wondering like okay

1043
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:38,539
people who are selling these exploits

1044
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,099
need to be discoverable by the people

1045
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:41,569
who would like to purchase them the

1046
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,460
first half of your presentation looked

1047
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:46,400
at some of that so I'm wondering what

1048
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,960
the total cost is to put up shell

1049
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,029
companies or fronts that look

1050
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,240
governmental and simply buy these things

1051
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:55,599
and then on the other side people who

1052
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,000
would wish to report alleged

1053
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,490
surveillance to a good actor like you

1054
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,980
also face a discoverability challenge

1055
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,689
they need to become aware that you exist

1056
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,539
there may be language issues there may

1057
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,460
be simple access issues and then they

1058
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:13,279
need some way to communicate with you so

1059
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:17,809
I'm curious how you monitor measure or

1060
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:20,420
attempt to mitigate bad actors posing as

1061
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:23,450
you so discoverability on both sides

1062
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,549
that's interesting compound question

1063
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,899
didn't sound naive to me at all but the

1064
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,460
first part of it was a question why

1065
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,660
don't people do these other things why

1066
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,819
don't they create fronts and shells

1067
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,339
here's I think one way to look at this

1068
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:36,799
there's been an arms industry for a long

1069
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:38,869
time and it's a bunch of people who know

1070
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:41,839
each other and they have lots of ways of

1071
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:43,970
operating in Gray's and almost all of it

1072
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,700
is based on trust and relationships and

1073
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,640
brokers and I think that this industry

1074
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:52,700
doesn't just borrow tactics from that

1075
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,529
industry it is that industry it is an

1076
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,118
arms industry when you say arms right

1077
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:57,650
now you mean physical arms that's

1078
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,509
correct yeah so the physical arms

1079
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,250
industry has existed for decades and in

1080
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:03,200
many ways I think the place that we have

1081
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,630
gotten to with a lot of this spyware

1082
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,359
looks really similar it's even sold at

1083
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,549
the same industry events so I think it's

1084
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:11,690
challenging I think it'd be challenging

1085
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:12,890
for anybody who wished to insert

1086
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,599
themselves and get meaningful

1087
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,859
information from all but the dumb

1088
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,930
players who didn't have enough

1089
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:20,598
capital or relationships to avoid you

1090
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:22,430
know sort of an easy trap to the second

1091
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,989
question sort of people impersonating us

1092
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,819
let me turn that around a little bit and

1093
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:30,049
say we have actually been targeted as

1094
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:32,799
the lab so in the last year black cube a

1095
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:36,470
spy a spy company with a bunch of

1096
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:39,739
ex-mossad folks was hired to target my

1097
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:41,149
colleague bahar and myself and we turned

1098
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:42,410
the tables on them and exposed them at a

1099
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,900
restaurant in New York and bottling a

1100
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,940
camera team but we're kind of in an

1101
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,230
interesting position right now we have

1102
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,109
these great metrics of success right

1103
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:55,039
they sent spies after you but I think

1104
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:56,420
more generally as researchers we benefit

1105
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,880
from the credibility of our academic

1106
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,460
freedom and from our position but we're

1107
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,829
also now bumping up against really

1108
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,900
powerful interests with real resources

1109
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:08,119
and I think what would help us the most

1110
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,160
is for there to be a depth of other

1111
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:12,109
researchers who are also working on this

1112
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,450
case so that nobody would think man if

1113
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:16,038
we just sort of you know discredited a

1114
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,259
couple of these guys from citizen lab

1115
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,339
maybe we'd you know solve the problem

1116
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:20,299
but thanks for your question I want to

1117
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:23,808
make sure that I get to other people too

1118
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:26,450
yeah thank you very much thanks Amira's

1119
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:28,970
work from UConn thankfully wonderful

1120
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,799
presentation important walk and I have a

1121
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:34,879
question actually following on Rogers

1122
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:37,538
question it is very important technical

1123
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,720
walk trying to help people and so on but

1124
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:43,700
can't we as an industry experts do

1125
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:48,259
something like similar to what happened

1126
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:50,868
by atomic researchers to promote arms

1127
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:53,749
control because this is really something

1128
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:57,079
where we as the technical society may be

1129
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:59,538
the the entity that could help to move

1130
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:02,599
the general public by bounding

1131
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:04,809
collecting together and promoting this

1132
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,180
to the general public explaining this

1133
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:10,460
non-trivial situation so that's the

1134
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,190
question really good question so on the

1135
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,710
topic of arms control since we're there

1136
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,089
if you look at the drivers of arms

1137
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,259
control and let's not talk about nuclear

1138
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:19,910
weapons for a second but let's talk

1139
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:21,980
about the control of smaller weapons

1140
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,970
right the most destabilizing thing that

1141
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,859
happened in the past few decades

1142
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,439
arguably was the end of the Soviet Union

1143
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:29,359
and the movement of millions upon

1144
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,700
millions of Kalashnikovs RPG

1145
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,098
and small weapons from former Soviet

1146
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,529
satellite states into Africa and into

1147
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:38,209
other regions of conflict right those

1148
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:41,239
are weapons that will last decades and

1149
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:43,368
they create a big problem the reason why

1150
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:46,039
arms control frameworks were partly

1151
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:48,979
developed is because nations with power

1152
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:51,109
saw this as a destabilizing thing that

1153
00:43:48,979 --> 00:43:53,569
they couldn't ignore unfortunately I

1154
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:56,180
think right now were at such a low level

1155
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:57,589
of knowledge about the impact of many of

1156
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,509
these threats including on governments

1157
00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:01,880
and others that they don't really feel

1158
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:03,289
that imperative very strongly and many

1159
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,180
of the governments that would be the

1160
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:06,829
best players at this have domestic

1161
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:09,200
industry is selling this stuff that they

1162
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:11,509
would really rather not see regulated I

1163
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,419
would love to see meaningful regulation

1164
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:15,469
like that I'm just not sure how we get

1165
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,180
there without a lot more knowledge about

1166
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:19,969
the case

1167
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:21,379
I mean the only thing I'll add is you

1168
00:44:19,969 --> 00:44:23,180
know it's it's much harder to prevent

1169
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,859
the export of a piece of code than you

1170
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,598
know like a nuclear weapon like there's

1171
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:27,499
less physical stuff that you can like

1172
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,630
everyone knows how to build nuclear

1173
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:31,160
weapons there's books you can buy Amazon

1174
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,200
how to build a nuclear weapon problem is

1175
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,609
getting the physical stuff and I think

1176
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,680
it's it's much much harder to prevent

1177
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,359
the spread of knowledge and expertise

1178
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,140
and you know skill sharing and

1179
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:44,869
consulting and that sort of stuff yeah

1180
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:48,430
two different two things first yes it is

1181
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:51,559
harder to control the proliferation but

1182
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,899
regulations agreement could limit this

1183
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,299
kind of open market and that would have

1184
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,009
been a huge difference I mean that would

1185
00:44:56,299 --> 00:45:01,099
have prevented such companies from

1186
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:03,170
becoming young big corporations okay so

1187
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,479
I think that arms control can be

1188
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,729
effective not hundred-percent but can be

1189
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:10,729
very effective and the other thing is

1190
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:13,399
yes I agree that the problem of small

1191
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:15,499
weapons control is very important but I

1192
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,660
do think that what we should be looking

1193
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:20,479
for is something actually more similar

1194
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:23,749
to you know nuclear weapons and so on

1195
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:26,868
and these are things were we could get

1196
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:29,479
the public opinion moving that is what

1197
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:32,690
happened with you know with nuclear

1198
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:34,339
weapons by scientists and I think that's

1199
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,839
something to scale that's all thank you

1200
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:37,369
totally agree with you I think the

1201
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,808
challenge is how do we get to a place of

1202
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:41,859
consensus around the need for that

1203
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:41,859
thanks for questions thank you

1204
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:47,300
super fascinating perspective and great

1205
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,340
material thanks a lot very important

1206
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,620
workers force

1207
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,240
moreover curiosity than anything else in

1208
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,350
in the research domain at least there is

1209
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:59,720
a lot of momentum being gained by

1210
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:02,240
methods for attacker deception and I

1211
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,279
wonder how that would apply if it

1212
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,779
applies at all if it's even in scope of

1213
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,380
your operations given the kind of

1214
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,630
adversaries you guys have do you want to

1215
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,660
define this hacker deception for us Oh

1216
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,400
like you know pretending that the attack

1217
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,080
worked and making them lose a lot of

1218
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,200
time or giving them false information

1219
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,200
that kind of you know they saves them

1220
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:28,730
well it's certainly the case that you

1221
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,560
know there are a lot of impacts of these

1222
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,240
attacks beyond the actual success of the

1223
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,950
attack you know the sort of chilling of

1224
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,959
factor the sort of time or even then

1225
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:42,080
force information that kind of you know

1226
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:44,390
they saves them well it's certainly the

1227
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,890
case that you know there are a lot of

1228
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,450
impacts of these attacks beyond the

1229
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,220
actual success of the attack you know

1230
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,200
the sort of chilling effect or the sort

1231
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,609
of you know fear we all live with oh my

1232
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,470
god like I'm compromised all the time

1233
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,480
there's nothing I can do is and there's

1234
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:58,609
no steps I can take to prevent myself

1235
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,560
from becoming a target of this and

1236
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,630
unfortunately you know for the really

1237
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,000
you know sexy zero days your quick stuff

1238
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,920
you know that's probably true but in

1239
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,390
fact you know for the vast majority of

1240
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,160
people you know it's because it's based

1241
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,740
on cost right how important are you how

1242
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,330
expensive do you feel like how worth you

1243
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,799
know how much is the private information

1244
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,060
that you have worth to the government

1245
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,330
how much are they willing to spend to

1246
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,890
compromise you so for the average person

1247
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:24,080
I think even for the you know sort of

1248
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,850
mid-range dissident there are a lot of

1249
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,080
things that that they can do and this is

1250
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,270
where you know things like training and

1251
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,960
we're aware nastazya and stuff like that

1252
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:37,280
can help a bit yeah thanks for your

1253
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,200
question though yeah I'd like to ask I

1254
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,640
mean aren't there any agents or

1255
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,259
countermeasures you can install on a

1256
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,940
device they could at least detect if

1257
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:48,770
you've been attacked by one of these

1258
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:51,410
systems wouldn't that be great but like

1259
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:53,540
in just just in practice just to keep it

1260
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,009
in your mind when this technology is

1261
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,460
sold

1262
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,900
it much of it comes with a little sheet

1263
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,369
guaranteeing non detection right it's

1264
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,810
like the equivalent of like the zero

1265
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:04,700
detection zon virustotal

1266
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,529
right like guaranteed not to be detected

1267
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,149
detected by like McAfee Enterprise and

1268
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,730
Norton and stuff like that I mean I

1269
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,869
think the answer is right at the high

1270
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,390
level this stuff is pretty sophisticated

1271
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:16,579
and they'll profile their target pretty

1272
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:19,009
well before they do it it would be great

1273
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:20,900
if there were more on device things that

1274
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,760
could be done I think that's you know a

1275
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:29,570
hard to solve problem in general thanks

1276
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:31,700
though next question right now we have a

1277
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:33,380
project that's focused on building the

1278
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,910
capacity of civil society groups the

1279
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,890
first responder communities that are

1280
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:40,210
interacting with a lot of these end

1281
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:42,200
users that y'all that are targeted and

1282
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,270
you know there are a lot of reasons why

1283
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,430
right now there's a huge lack of skill

1284
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:48,820
within that community to actually be

1285
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:51,078
doing this research to protect their own

1286
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,359
and that's from lack of opportunities

1287
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,130
lack of resources and we're trying to

1288
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,690
address those particular things but

1289
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,150
given that citizen lab has been doing

1290
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,579
this for a long time what are your

1291
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:03,349
thoughts around how to scale skill among

1292
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,300
civil society and first responders

1293
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:07,280
because they weren't mentioned kind of

1294
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,680
in those key stakeholders that are doing

1295
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,680
security research right now but how can

1296
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,710
we get it so they build up a capacity

1297
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,149
and skill set to do so this is an

1298
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,760
awesome problem right it's a great

1299
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,670
question I think what we have found is

1300
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,660
that it happens through experience right

1301
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,270
in the same way that Trust is

1302
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,910
transactional experience over time with

1303
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:30,680
targeting makes civil society groups a

1304
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,540
lot better at this and my favorite

1305
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,549
example of this is the Tibetan diaspora

1306
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,170
which has just been targeted since it

1307
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,300
existed with different forms of

1308
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,849
electronic monitoring and after like

1309
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,800
decades of this kind of problem they

1310
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:44,630
figured out pretty clever ways to do

1311
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,880
their own security they have a cert tip

1312
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:50,270
cert for example but I just have to tell

1313
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,280
this story they were thinking okay so go

1314
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,500
back about 10 years and one of the

1315
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,329
biggest challenges they faced was emails

1316
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,410
with attachments containing malware so

1317
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,790
they're like how do we solve this

1318
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,618
problem everybody's sending everybody

1319
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:02,000
else attachments how do we deal with

1320
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:05,599
this and they came up with a quite novel

1321
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,980
solution which was a very Buddhist

1322
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,990
solution

1323
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:14,090
campaign called detach from attachments

1324
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,290
and it worked until the attackers after

1325
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,000
like a year or two figured it out and

1326
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,500
started masquerading as Google Drive

1327
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,290
links which is where they inhibited but

1328
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,750
um I think it's absolutely possible for

1329
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:25,910
civil society groups to work better in

1330
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,740
practice it often requires these deep

1331
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,790
partnerships with researchers and others

1332
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,470
so that at least in the beginning they

1333
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,970
can get information about what they're

1334
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,950
what they're working for I think we can

1335
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:37,279
safely say now for example civil society

1336
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,779
in Mexico is like not to be trifled with

1337
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,540
given how much time they've just spent

1338
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:47,570
looking for Pegasus stuff but great

1339
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:49,340
question Nick Weaver I could ask a silly

1340
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:56,750
question but I'm going to ask a serious

1341
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:59,150
one allegedly one thing is this stuff is

1342
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,970
usable for and used for real

1343
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:06,200
investigations etc of actual criminals

1344
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:10,939
and when it is misused by an actor and

1345
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:15,470
it ends up on on bills desk that has a

1346
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:18,800
bad fate sharing effect for the true law

1347
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:21,230
enforcement so the question is how much

1348
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,760
for the stuff you've investigated do you

1349
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:25,609
see stuff that really does look like

1350
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,670
just criminal investigations and are you

1351
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:30,410
starting to see the market split due to

1352
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:34,100
the damage you get when you fake share

1353
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:38,480
with somebody who sells to bad actors a

1354
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:40,100
fantastic question yeah I mean it I

1355
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,320
think there's not really too much

1356
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,690
evidence yet for a market split I mean

1357
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,420
we've seen in our most recent you know

1358
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:49,910
Dina's cash probing stuff of you know an

1359
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,070
Esso group we see you know usage by

1360
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,720
place plate your usage by governments

1361
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,220
where it looks like you know you you

1362
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,500
really wouldn't expect abuse like the

1363
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,609
Swiss government for instance or perhaps

1364
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,490
you know maybe the Singaporean

1365
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:05,060
government or other cases like that you

1366
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,770
know so I think I'm not sure if those

1367
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,810
governments have sort of you know really

1368
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,000
gotten the message that fate sharing is

1369
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:13,130
bad on the other hand though you know

1370
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,050
our methodology because you know we're

1371
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,690
in contact with civil society targets we

1372
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:19,490
cannot you know in most of the time we

1373
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,839
cannot produce findings of like Oh a

1374
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,879
criminal was targeted with spy

1375
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:24,319
because we're just you know not in touch

1376
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,210
with them we don't really have the

1377
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,400
desire or the means to get in touch with

1378
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,499
them but you know every now and then we

1379
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,940
do come across cases you know like if

1380
00:52:30,499 --> 00:52:33,738
we're looking for I don't know files I'm

1381
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,269
virustotal we'll see oh look there's

1382
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:37,069
this sample of finfisher that you know

1383
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,959
looks like it's you know related to a

1384
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:40,880
law enforcement thing or oh you know

1385
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,499
there's there's this target who tweeted

1386
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,930
about something that you know that that

1387
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:46,999
person looks like they're you know you

1388
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,239
know perhaps you know someone who you'd

1389
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:51,618
want to perhaps be be under surveillance

1390
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:53,329
so you know I I'm not sure that they've

1391
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:54,650
really figured out the fate sharing the

1392
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:56,569
sort of converse to the to the fate

1393
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,519
sharing is that you know once you have

1394
00:52:56,569 --> 00:53:00,319
this sort of critical mass of employees

1395
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:02,598
like let's say 600 employees at NSO

1396
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,400
group well I don't know like how many

1397
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,200
people are there out there in the world

1398
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,059
which you know have the expertise the

1399
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,160
capability and the experience to like

1400
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,690
flying vulnerabilities and iPhones and

1401
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,640
Android it's like if you hire up the

1402
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,710
whole market and corner the market maybe

1403
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,118
there's really no other solutions for

1404
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,180
them to turn to but I don't know we'll

1405
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:23,420
see we'll see as time goes on and and if

1406
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,819
we have any new insights there yeah just

1407
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,279
to build on what bill says I think for

1408
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,839
the same reason that a lot of countries

1409
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:31,910
purchased this stuff because they can't

1410
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,259
develop it there's also a lot of

1411
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,879
information externality they don't

1412
00:53:33,259 --> 00:53:37,009
really know what they're getting right

1413
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,259
they don't even know whether their

1414
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:44,499
activities with this technology are

1415
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:46,279
monitored by the governments whose

1416
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:48,439
jurisdictions the companies that sell

1417
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:51,049
this spyware exist in right so there's a

1418
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,219
big information problem and I think that

1419
00:53:51,049 --> 00:53:55,069
that is probably one of the things

1420
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:56,180
preventing feedback from going back to

1421
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:59,538
customers right there's a lot they don't

1422
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:01,940
know I'm great questioning hey my name

1423
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:04,900
is just this is a great presentation I

1424
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:07,190
was just curious how often do you get

1425
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:11,059
targeted by different governments while

1426
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:13,369
doing this work and I mean even doing

1427
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:15,440
this work I'm not even sure if there are

1428
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:18,950
any laws to protect you guys like how do

1429
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:22,819
you deal with that I mean it's a tough

1430
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:25,009
problem set right and I think the

1431
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:28,630
evolution that we've we've probably both

1432
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:32,269
experienced is we've spent a lot of time

1433
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,760
understanding the risks to others and in

1434
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,319
more recent years

1435
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,540
we're learning a lot about how it feels

1436
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,750
to also consider that some of those

1437
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,400
risks might be pointed at us for it for

1438
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,990
what we do we have time for one more

1439
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,980
question Roger are we I'm gonna cut it

1440
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,350
off there because people are getting

1441
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:51,570
antsy and thank you again for an amazing

1442
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:51,569
talk and thanks so much everyone
