1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,379
my name is Raymond - you can call me

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,130
Raymond my Chinese name is too hard -

3
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:21,050
people can't get it right so so right

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,360
now I met from the University of

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:27,140
Maryland this was done when I was at ASU

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,020
when I was a PhD PhD student under Adam

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,790
it was a great advisor so give it up for

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,440
him

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,500
all right um so first thing very

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,250
grateful that I got the this paper got

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,340
the distinguished paper award so thank

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,829
you all so much so it's my pleasure to

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,970
talk about this problem about telephone

14
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:53,180
spam and oh yeah I want to ask you a

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:58,040
question how many of you have received a

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,220
robo call today okay some of you all

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,350
right

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,329
but maybe you some of you guys sleeping

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,849
so let me ask you another question how

20
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:11,479
many of you have never received a robo

21
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:12,320
call in your life so most of you I guess

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,039
right

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,679
so 99% of you already received some robo

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,659
call in your life and so this is such as

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,240
I would agree that this is such a

26
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:25,250
serious problem actually John Oliver

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,839
also agree with me he didn't have to

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,840
sort on that on roboam calls and also to

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,540
this year according to the FCC about

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,600
half of all the telephone calls that you

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,930
receive would be some sort of spam scam

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,360
robo call so we wanted to do something

33
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,760
about this serious issue so what could

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,439
we do about it we kind of just copy what

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,860
other people do so three years ago

36
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,439
someone did a research I think it's Matt

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,280
he did a research on three users really

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,649
do plug in USB drives we were there

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,619
three years ago also presenting a paper

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,539
but we kind of stole his idea so this

41
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,599
year we decided to do our own version of

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,010
his idea right so what's the research

43
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,980
question the research question ready to

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,599
answer is what causes the users to

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,459
answer and fall victim to telephone

46
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,609
scams okay so how do we do that the

47
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,430
first step we had

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,960
understand how scams are like so do you

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,300
understand that what can we do we just

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,510
have to listen to them and to do that we

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,870
just collected 150 scam samples from

52
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,570
previous public sources and just like

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,910
listen to them like podcasts and kind of

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,700
figure out what kind of attributes we

55
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,510
could identify and test as an experiment

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:52,470
so what were the attributes that we've

57
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,720
identified for from listening to you

58
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,230
counters of these scam samples so here's

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,510
a list a real code right in the US or

60
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,299
many other countries the first few

61
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,970
digits represent an area code and from

62
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,220
the scan samples we found like there are

63
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,980
some distinctive patterns so one of the

64
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,140
pattern is a lot of scans are from the

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,959
federal government so they use a 202

66
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,329
area code and some of them they try to

67
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,250
spoof a neighbor like the local area

68
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,970
code so in our case our University back

69
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,260
then was that for a zero area code and

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,720
another one is pretty interesting is the

71
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,590
1-800 write the toll free area code it's

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,930
actually a real code if you know another

73
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,480
way is that if your phone that's a phone

74
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,489
directory or your phone has been already

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,429
pre-populated with some non contacts

76
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,900
right then if you spoof a caller ID of a

77
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,269
non-contact that you can actually

78
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,430
potentially display a caller ID name and

79
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:51,720
that might be useful for conducting a

80
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,250
scam with and in terms of the voice you

81
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,070
can change the voice right you can do

82
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,350
human voice or you could use like a

83
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,380
software synthesizer to create the

84
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:05,220
voices you can also test different

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,680
genders male or female gender so we and

86
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,209
accent some of the scam they have an

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,700
Indian accent so we kind of want to test

88
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,510
that if that actually makes a difference

89
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:18,899
and also identity so what identity they

90
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,690
use to kind of conduct the scan and in

91
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,609
this case we with so we want to test two

92
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,850
different ones one is the IRS which is

93
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,710
very common the IRS can they some of you

94
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,960
might know and the other one is the HR

95
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,760
department so this is an internal entity

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,370
from a university so on the test if we

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,550
can kind of Spearfish an internal entity

98
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,550
and there needs to be a motivation to

99
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,889
provide the scan so such as in this case

100
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,280
we want to get a social security number

101
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:52,630
of our recipients so we use excuses like

102
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,599
tax or payroll issues to motivate them

103
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,570
to give out their information so with

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,880
these attributes in mind how do we

105
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:06,969
design the experiments right so here's

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,860
the design principle we have a limited

107
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,550
budget we cannot run every experiment

108
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,460
possible on earth so so we have to

109
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,169
design a minimum set of experiments that

110
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,060
allow us to do comparison of different

111
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:22,270
actually properties that we just

112
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,979
mentioned but with a set of standard

113
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,380
background condition so that will allow

114
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:29,460
us to reduce the number of tests we can

115
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,530
run so here's the list of all the

116
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,810
experiments that we've designed or came

117
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,270
up with so the main idea is that there

118
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,180
are ten different experiments and each

119
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,659
experiment is designed to test a

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,430
specific attribute property for example

121
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,160
like a real code or one of them is like

122
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,729
to test like non-color name and so on

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,030
and so forth so with that 10 experiments

124
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:57,639
design the next step is to basically

125
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,469
kind of start spamming but we need to

126
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,389
first get the phone numbers so we know

127
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,300
in phone numbers so what can we gather

128
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:07,750
phone numbers from what we have to do

129
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,960
what a real world scanner would do which

130
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,750
is to download our universities public

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,099
phone directory associated with staffs

132
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,720
and faculties so at ASU the the phone

133
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:25,060
directory is public actually a lot of

134
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,280
universities are right so but because we

135
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,130
have to inform a lot of people when we

136
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,070
do the scans so we have to remove those

137
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:36,070
people from the list of fact that the

138
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:39,760
phone number list so that it won't

139
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,830
affect our study and so out of that the

140
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,070
remaining list we randomly selected

141
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:49,349
3,000 phone numbers and then assign 300

142
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,349
of them to that each of the 10 expert

143
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:59,699
so we are researchers and we kind of are

144
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,960
ethical so we had to make sure that we

145
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,379
have to mitigate the risk to our

146
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,090
recipients so the first thing you have

147
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,159
to do in every university environment is

148
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,080
to work with the IRB right so we work

149
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:13,650
with them to design the experimental

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,198
process and the number one thing was

151
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,539
make sure no SSM was actually collected

152
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,130
so all the SS and all the experiments no

153
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,280
SSM was actually collected even though

154
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:26,219
we threatened to you right and upon

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,559
entering any Social Security digit if

156
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,750
they actually press anything immediately

157
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,069
so we do record the action they press

158
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,720
something but we don't recall what

159
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,479
number they press and then immediately

160
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,000
their roof like informed about hey this

161
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,530
is actually an experiment no SSM was

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,449
actually collected if you have any

163
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:46,229
complaints this is our number and IRB

164
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:50,550
number yeah and also you know not annoy

165
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,229
our recipients we just only recall the

166
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,509
access it just made one phone call per

167
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:59,930
recipient and and also prior to

168
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,940
dissemination we communicate it with our

169
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,319
HR department and also the tech support

170
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,500
office to make sure that they know how

171
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,979
to respond to the phone calls that we

172
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,360
sent out and people complaining right

173
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:18,180
okay so with that out of the way finally

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,639
we still cannot disseminate problem.we

175
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,469
because we need to we need we need we

176
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,389
need to make sure ours procedure is

177
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,919
standardized and automated imagine

178
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,870
having to make 3,000 phone calls

179
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,409
like that's that's gonna be a problem

180
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,440
right so so we did what a an actual

181
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:37,229
scammer would do also so just we kind of

182
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,120
find a online robocalling platform and

183
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,279
loaded our experiments with the

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,099
attributes that were supposed to test

185
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,360
and so we started we created ten

186
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,240
different campaigns with that online

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,250
platform right and so that with that

188
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,370
time platform ten different platforms so

189
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:57,029
it means that we can run 10 experiments

190
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,860
simultaneously and also we limited all

191
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,740
the experiments to your single work week

192
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,910
do

193
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,730
to work hours in between 10:00 to 5:00

194
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,400
p.m. and also we also set up such that

195
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,100
both the inbound outbound calls and

196
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,250
inbound calls were directed to the start

197
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,420
of each experiment standard procedure so

198
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,740
what what's the standard procedure like

199
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,579
so here's what the standard procedure

200
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,720
like so let me explain to you one by one

201
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,730
first thing is of course you need to

202
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,500
start with the ring you need to ring the

203
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,360
recipient work phone and display the

204
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,800
visual attributes that's associated with

205
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,020
that experiment so here's an example we

206
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:44,109
showed a four eight zero area code which

207
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:45,910
is local to a university and is if they

208
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,620
answered so because of that visual

209
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,810
property if they answered that phone

210
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,960
call then there's the next step which

211
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:56,010
was which we which we will play a what

212
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,230
we call a scenario announcement message

213
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:02,439
basically it just has all the voice

214
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,530
attributes and the scenario and entity

215
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:14,410
associated with that experiment and so

216
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:16,680
here's an example come on I really hope

217
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,650
this works

218
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,479
so I don't think you see it okay so I

219
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,780
don't think nothing next over a chain

220
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,780
Network

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,339
this is an urgent notice this is a final

222
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,160
notice from the IRS the reason for this

223
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,449
call so this is from the beautiful voice

224
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,300
of Adam do pay

225
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:46,859
he was the scammer in this case so in

226
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,750
that previous message they were asked to

227
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,029
you like they were under like some sort

228
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,069
of tax lawsuit and they have to continue

229
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,170
by pressing one so if we record that

230
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,479
action if they press one and then it

231
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:01,110
goes on to the next step which is to

232
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,029
play a message that will ask them to

233
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,279
enter the last four digits of their

234
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,800
social security number so here's what it

235
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,649
sounds like please wait for the next

236
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,349
available agent thank you for holding

237
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,839
your call will be connected shortly

238
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,790
please enter the last four digits of

239
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:23,100
your social security number on your

240
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:26,129
phone as you enter the last four digits

241
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,290
of social security number so at this

242
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:30,600
point if they press any digit at all

243
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,980
okay we recorded action of pressing

244
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,120
something but we don't know what that

245
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,579
digit is for IRB so at this point the

246
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,209
user will hear immediately here a

247
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,769
debriefing message and it's pretty long

248
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:47,489
so I won't play the whole thing so basic

249
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:49,889
idea is this it has the ask them hey

250
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,930
this is not we tell them this is not

251
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,850
actually a scam it is just an experiment

252
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,579
no social security number was actually

253
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,139
collected and also at the end we also

254
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,959
asked them hey can you please

255
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,699

256
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:07,349

professor Adam do you pay that's my

260

the survey message the survey are there

264
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,520
to survey questions the first one is we

265
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,439
asked them were you convinced or

266
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,560
unconvinced by scamp bias camp so they

267
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,390
have two options 0 1 yes or no and then

268
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,979
the follow-up question to the first

269
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,660
question is what was the reason you were

270
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,300
convinced or unconvinced by the scam and

271
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,800
in this question we actually record

272
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,459
their voice so they have to give like a

273
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,530
voice recording for the second question

274
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,930
ok so here's what it sounds like

275
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,240
thank you could you please help us

276
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,920
understand if the scam was able to

277
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,210
convince you to enter your social

278
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,000
security number so they hear that this

279
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:10,030
is one the question ok so after the two

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,860
questions they were being asked so were

281
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,860
they were here an IRB statement they

282
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,580
were here at the contact information for

283
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,740
us and for the IRB and then that's

284
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,680
basically it for all the standard

285
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,930
procedure for every experiment ok so now

286
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,699
we're actually ready to send out the

287
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:33,430
phone calls so we sent out all three

288
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,400
thousand phone calls over a work week

289
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,469
and here's the log of what it looks like

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,180
so this is a log of all the recipients

291
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,150
that press'd want to continue doing the

292
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,280
3,000 phone calls as you can see it's

293
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,689
not a pretty it's not that uniform you

294
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,339
can see there are actually a few

295
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,580
problems with that there are two big

296
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,140
tips there right so what happened

297
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,750
actually some there are few incidents

298
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,760
that came up unexpected during during

299
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,730
the experiments we try to predict for

300
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,490
everything but we kind of like there's

301
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,490
some problems so what's the one so

302
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:10,030
here's a basic timeline of what happened

303
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:13,180
at about two hours and 45 minutes since

304
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:16,170
launch the School of Journalism and mass

305
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,420
communication identified our scam calls

306
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:23,219
so because there are mass communication

307
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:26,979
major so they sent out a mass email to

308
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,690
inform everyone that there was a scam

309
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,889
call and they didn't consult with the IT

310
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,619
department who was

311
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,779
I'll behave relax this is not a phone it

312
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:36,100
is not a scam right so didn't kind of

313
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:40,299
care they did they communicate it

314
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,429
without asking so yeah and they're 4

315
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,850
minutes 4 hours and 22 minutes since

316
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:47,319
launch the universities serve telephone

317
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:54,100
service office started blocking our

318
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:56,229
phone calls yeah why because our phone

319
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,869
calls were triggering IT system alerts

320
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,839
because we sent out so our phone calls

321
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:04,329
so fast that it was exhausting our

322
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,559
University's telephone control who kind

323
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:13,149
of ddosed our University's telephone

324
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:17,469
system yeah so we had to reduce the rate

325
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:24,119
of our outgoing calls and then the next

326
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:24,119
day the IRB received a lot of complaints

327
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:29,410
so they asked us to pause our

328
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,999
experiments as they could review the

329
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,329
study to make sure that everything is

330
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:37,419
going as described so 12 hours later

331
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:41,439
after some review they found everything

332
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:44,829
was in order so we could proceed yeah so

333
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:47,498
and then things went on okay so after

334
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:49,959
the five days we collected our results

335
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:52,749
so here are all the results that we've

336
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,699
kind of collected so there's there six

337
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:57,369
major actions that we recorded we

338
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:59,258
recorded from each of experiment so one

339
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:00,939
is the continued that requests the

340
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,869
number of users that press one to

341
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:04,118
continue when they hear the first

342
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:06,579
message the second one is the entered

343
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:08,350
SSN which records whether they took in

344
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:11,349
action right when they were asked to

345
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,389
enter the last four digits SSN and then

346
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,129
the next one is the survey part so

347
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,629
convinced is the number of user they

348
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:19,299
stated they were convinced by the scan

349
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:21,399
and the next one is the recording of how

350
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,600
many recordings related to that and then

351
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:29,889
the other one was the number of

352
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:32,079
unconvinced and they're recording so we

353
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,539
have the data but that's not enough so

354
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,969
we need to do analysis on that to

355
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:39,220
perform an analysis we need to find a

356
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,100
suitable analysis metric because we have

357
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,910
six different options to to analyze all

358
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,769
right

359
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,079
this is kind of

360
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:49,079
challenging I mean they're too obvious

361
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,238
once one is entered SSN so we can

362
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,738
compare a number of enter SSN but

363
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,209
problem with this approach is that it's

364
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:56,249
actually kind of tool acts as a measure

365
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,229
because users could have actually

366
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,660
entered a fake SSN just to see what's

367
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,100
going on all right thanks okay and the

368
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,389
other one is convinced there's also has

369
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,559
an issue because not many people

370
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,520
actually tell us that they were

371
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,260
convinced by the scam okay so in the end

372
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,629
here's our chosen metric which is

373
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,099
possibly tricked which is a more

374
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,809
reasonable estimate

375
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,799
so it's couch it's a derived metric

376
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:23,490
which is calculated by subtracting

377
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,429
unconvince from number entered SSN so it

378
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,460
have kind of have this balance so here's

379
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:32,010
the results of possibly tricked across

380
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,919
all six ten different I come across 10

381
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:39,270
experiments so the one that performed

382
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:41,159
the best is that experiment 9 which

383
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,340
basically means that as the scenario of

384
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:47,070
payroll payroll what with help and the

385
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,580
kalida shows a w-2 administration as the

386
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,529
name and the worst performing experiment

387
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:58,620
was a yeah but unclaimed tax return from

388
00:17:52,529 --> 00:18:00,419
the IRS yeah okay so we did further so

389
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,820
that was not enough still because we

390
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,020
want to capture what exactly makes the

391
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,770
difference right in terms of the

392
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,870
attribute by itself so one so this is

393
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,320
one the type of analysis we did linear

394
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,928
regression coefficients so so across all

395
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,110
the coefficients and all the attribute

396
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:22,340
properties we calculated or over fit at

397
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:25,529
all done to get the linear regression

398
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:29,340
coefficients on possibly tricked so that

399
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:32,010
we can have a comparison and the other

400
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,199
one is a more statistically rigorous we

401
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,990
do statistical and significance testing

402
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,730
and effect size comparable attributes

403
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:44,309
and so given these hypotheses which test

404
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,760
different a comparable attribute the one

405
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:51,360
that we found was conclusive was the

406
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,908
entity scenario so which basically means

407
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,010
that the entity if you use a certain

408
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:58,100
type of entity scenario is actually

409
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,049
significant

410
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,149
in terms of being more likely to get

411
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,850
user to get tricked by to buy by the

412
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,000
scam okay so that the two type of

413
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,100
calculations we did was adjust a p-value

414
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,470
some p-value adjusted so it was adjusted

415
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,860
because it was adjusted with a step-down

416
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,500
method got a home Peroni step-down

417
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:24,709
method and the other one was the effect

418
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:26,299
size yeah okay and also on the reasons

419
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,730
the users that stated they were

420
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,340
convinced their various reasons mostly

421
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:35,029
is because of the scam was kind of

422
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,139
convincing but for the reasons I'm

423
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,909
convinced this is actually pretty

424
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,799
interesting so most of them there's a

425
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,929
clear reason why they're not convinced

426
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,600
so they knew that you were suspecting

427
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:49,340
that the IRS or the our university won't

428
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,110
make a phone call like this okay so what

429
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,500
can we learn some I'm almost done

430
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:57,408
so spear phishing is expected you

431
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,570
telephone scammers may spoof a non

432
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:01,429
caller ID name and voice a plausible

433
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,789
scenario to make the scam exceptionally

434
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:07,010
convincing so how can we protect the

435
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,440
user make the users be aware of

436
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,120
telephone scan right for example let

437
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,100
them know the HR won't make calls like

438
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,219
this the other way is to adopt caller ID

439
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,908
our technology authentication technology

440
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:21,890
I have a paper on it by the way

441
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:24,440
okay provides safeguards against caller

442
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,059
ID spoofing so why we need that right we

443
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,429
freaking provide safeguards against

444
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,289
telephone caller ID spoofing it's

445
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,529
possible for us to fight malicious cost

446
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,539
with a usable caller ID reputation

447
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:37,520
system and finally we need more research

448
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,899
in this space we don't have enough

449
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,110
researchers in the space so we need more

450
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:44,870
understanding in the scammers all right

451
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:51,189
okay so that's all thank you all so much

452
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:51,189
[Applause]
