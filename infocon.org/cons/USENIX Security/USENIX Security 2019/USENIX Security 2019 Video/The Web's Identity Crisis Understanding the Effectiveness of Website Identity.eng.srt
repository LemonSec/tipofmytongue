00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,160
hi I'm Chris I work on HTTP adoption

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,350
efforts and usable security for Google

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,320
Chrome this talk is about the problems

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,110
we face in explaining website identity

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,670
to user is how our current solutions

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,150
fall short and the directions that we

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,440
think are most promising going forward

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,210
for the sake of time I'm going to keep

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,080
things a little bit high level but the

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:40,430
full details are available in our paper

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:42,680
so what is website identity two browsers

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,870
the principle notion of website identity

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,970
is the origin of the page this is the

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,409
tuple of scheme host and port and this

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,949
is the backbone of the web security

16
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:57,650
model the origin is also a key website

17
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:59,870
identity indicator that we show to users

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,210
of browsers to tell them what site

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,459
they're on browsers show the origin

20
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,260
prominently in the location bar with

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,009
different ways to try to highlight the

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,350
domain part of it kind of the key piece

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,390
in addition to showing the origin for

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,119
about a decade now browsers have shown

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,299
special UI for extended validation or

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,750
Eevee certificates an Eevee certificate

27
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:26,450
Associates a website domain with a legal

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,670
entity whose name and jurisdiction is

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,640
typically displayed alongside the URL in

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,740
the location bar users can check the

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,899
Eevee indicator to verify that a website

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,859
is associated with a legal entity that

33
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,909
they know and trust so previously in

34
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,850
Chrome we've looked at simplifying

35
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,170
connection security indicators and our

36
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,449
focus there has been to reduce our

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,000
reliance on positive security indicators

38
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,920
for positive indicators to protect a

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,109
user the user has to notice their

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,359
absence and in general we found that

41
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:59,479
this is just not very natural for users

42
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:02,298
and the web ecosystem has mostly moved

43
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,490
to HTTPS by default kind of it's the

44
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,960
default expectation of a user you kind

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,508
of hope that everything out there uses

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,970
HTTPS so it's much less noticeable

47
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:13,010
notable that a site has a lock next to

48
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,470
it in the omnibox or the location bar

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,299
and we like it that way

50
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,859
we want the web to be HTTPS so instead

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,260
we've focused on the cases that matter

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,520
with negative security indicators as

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,100
much

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,830
possible so for the treatment of HTTP

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,960
pages we actively call it out is not

56
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,390
secure and when a user enter starts

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,190
entering data in a form we downgrade

58
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,290
this indicator even more to draw their

59
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,480
attention to it when a user does

60
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,859
something potentially risky we should

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,299
make that clear to them and when we

62
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,760
really know that something is going

63
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,910
wrong we try to help the user avoid it

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,350
with clear calls to action like with our

65
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,880
certificate error the phishing error

66
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,299
here or our malware errors to reframe

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,220
this with a non browser example a check

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,860
engine light turns on when things are

69
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,500
failing rather than an engine ok light

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,560
turning off or turning oh yeah turning

71
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,670
off when things are going well which

72
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,620
would you rather see and which would you

73
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,280
be more likely to notice when things go

74
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,170
wrong so while we can rely on Safe

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,510
Browsing to help us actively warn users

76
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,970
about known threats like phishing sites

77
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,790
and malware we're currently reliant on

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,450
existing website identity indicators for

79
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,350
basically all other cases so we show the

80
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,600
user the origin in the location bar or

81
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,829
for sites with Eevee certs we also show

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,420
the organization name and jurisdiction

83
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,520
except for Safari which stops showing

84
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,739
the organization name in fall 2018 and

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,070
now only shows the host name but in

86
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,440
green anyway for these positive website

87
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,000
identity indicators to work users have

88
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,880
to notice when they're missing or

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,860
different than expected you only have to

90
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,660
miss the positive indicator once on

91
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:10,870
PayPal to get fished another

92
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,280
complication with Eevee specifically so

93
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,280
we've seen a number of realistic

94
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,100
proof-of-concept attacks against Eevee

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,350
certs such as the stripe Inc name

96
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,450
collision attack shown here where a

97
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,910
perfectly valid Eevee certificate was

98
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,260
issued for a stripe in a different state

99
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,530
than the popular payment processing

100
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,800
company as Ian Carroll recently

101
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,690
recounted on Mozilla devstack policy he

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,710
did this over lunch in high school for a

103
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,710
hundred and seventy seven dollars

104
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,609
this results in basically identical UI

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,289
in browsers another example attack is

106
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,200
someone getting an Eevee certificate for

107
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,360
a company named identity verified this

108
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,020
then gets shown prominently in browser

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,420
UI to users additionally I will note

110
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,490
that the Eevee guidelines specifically

111
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,940
say that the purpose of Eevee is not to

112
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:06,580
verify that the holder is law-abiding

113
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:09,050
trustworthy or safe so given all of this

114
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:14,180
we wanted to evaluate whether current

115
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,040
site identity indicators help users the

116
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,740
simplest question to ask is whether the

117
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,040
absence of the Eevee UI effects user

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,720
behavior to do this we ran a large-scale

119
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,850
field experiment in chrome where we

120
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,160
stopped showing the Eevee UI to a sample

121
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,990
of users so in the control condition we

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,930
showed the Eevee UI in the treatment

123
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,400
condition we didn't and we wanted to see

124
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,040
whether this is any effect on a whole

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,580
slew of user metrics that we collected

126
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,890
so these are things like navigation

127
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,919
behavior form behavior interactions with

128
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,770
autofill interactions with the security

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,690
indicator and page info downloads

130
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,340
started on the page and overall

131
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:57,020
engagement with sites and in the end we

132
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,150
found that it doesn't really have an

133
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,280
effect on user behavior we found little

134
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,130
evidence that the absence of the Eevee

135
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,510
indicator affected how users interact

136
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:11,240
with sites so after our field study in

137
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,120
chrome we wanted to dive deeper into how

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,400
and why users understood site identity

139
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,290
indicators to do this we performed a

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,510
series of online experimental surveys in

141
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,160
the first we showed popular financial

142
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,000
site login pages to users in a

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,250
screenshot but with some tweaks so

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,050
remember that the e v UI includes the

145
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,940
country of jurisdiction in a two-letter

146
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,100
country code to try to disambiguate

147
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,000
which legal entity is actually being

148
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,340
referred to

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,810
so paypal is a US company so it says us

150
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,700
we swapped out the country code of

151
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,070
jurisdiction on paypal for participants

152
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,289
in the US and hsbc for participants in

153
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,960
the UK to see if participants would

154
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,999
notice and we asked them how comfortable

155
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,938
they were logging

156
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:57,129
and why we also asked participants to

157
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,899
click on the screenshot to point to what

158
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:01,569
elements informed their comfort or

159
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:05,169
discomfort that made up that decision

160
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:06,819
and across all of our conditions we

161
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,698
found no significant difference in

162
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:11,199
participants recorded comfort levels we

163
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,219
showed different country codes we

164
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,439
admitted the country code entirely so

165
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:20,739
here is a heat map for where

166
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:24,339
participants clicked on HSBC login page

167
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:27,869
but the Great Britain country indicator

168
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,869
has been swapped for are you

169
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:34,959
the main hot spots here are the lock

170
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:39,429
icon that's the huge red circle trailed

171
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:42,610
by HTTPS the protocol scheme in the URL

172
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:45,578
bar and then the word security in the

173
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:49,719
URL and then various things within the

174
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:51,549
content area on the page so compare it

175
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:54,248
to the heat map for the unmodified UI

176
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:57,609
this is HSBC with the Eevee indicator

177
00:07:54,249 --> 00:08:02,529
with GB country code the results are

178
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:04,659
basically the same or compared to the

179
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:07,808
results for PayPal with an ru country

180
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:11,498
code participants clicked on the lock

181
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:15,419
icon the HTTP scheme paypal in the URL

182
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:18,249
and the PayPal logo in the content area

183
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,318
so us participants were most likely to

184
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:23,169
describe feeling familiar with the

185
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,659
webpage PayPal is well known so it makes

186
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,519
me feel somewhat comfortable while UK

187
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,789
participants most commonly pointed to an

188
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,068
HTTPS indicator like the HTTPS along

189
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:37,149
with the padlock in the address bar but

190
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:40,029
not easy specific UI only a few notice

191
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,558
oddities in the pages country code even

192
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,379
when they did notice it didn't

193
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:46,839
necessarily make them uncomfortable for

194
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:51,730
example I never noticed the mx on a

195
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:53,680
paypal page but it seems legit so while

196
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,720
our first study is focused on Chrome

197
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,719
because we had access to make changes in

198
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,579
Chrome and we knew what to test for we

199
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,949
weren't the first movers in this space

200
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:05,199
and so we wanted to see what other how

201
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,589
users reacted to other modern browsers

202
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:08,650
even

203
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,570
you I specifically as I said before in

204
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,880
the fall of 2018 Apple's Safari browser

205
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,710
removed the legal entity name in their

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,530
location bar and simply started showing

207
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,660
the host name in green instead so we ran

208
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,970
another online survey experiment similar

209
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,160
to our previous one to assess user

210
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,950
comfort on the login pages with the old

211
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,689
UI and the new UI we found no

212
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,640
significant difference in participants

213
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,250
comfort levels across both conditions in

214
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,620
the US and the UK so we use PayPal and

215
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,390
HSBC again showed them the old and the

216
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,120
new UI

217
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,340
no difference interestingly participants

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,920
were a bit split as to whether the evie

219
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,590
indicator made them feel comfortable or

220
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,709
uncomfortable in the Safari UI so to

221
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,310
point this out in Safari in the old UI

222
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:56,140
the URL was not shown at all for sites

223
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,329
with Eevee certs only the legal entity

224
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,880
name so some users said things like

225
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,800
looks like the genuine page but I'd like

226
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,030
more reassurance of this like being able

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,859
to see the URL so what made users feel

228
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,660
comfortable or uncomfortable logging in

229
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,730
here's another heat map of UK

230
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,550
participants shown the HSBC login page

231
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,860
and in the old UI condition with the

232
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,069
legal entity name they primarily pointed

233
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,960
to the lock icon and then the HSBC text

234
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,840
in the location bar in part of the Eevee

235
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:30,430
name and then the HSBC UK logo in the

236
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,740
content area for participants in the new

237
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,949
UI condition which just showed the host

238
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,930
name they again primarily pointed to the

239
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,600
lock icon and then the host name and

240
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,000
then the HSBC UK logo in the content

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,640
area as well as some of the security

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,310
advisory buttons down lower in the

243
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,390
content area okay so that's Eevee but

244
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,880
what other ways do we express site

245
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,260
identity to users the core one for the

246
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,280
web the one that makes up the security

247
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,410
model is the origin of the URL but as

248
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,540
with the Eevee indicator past research

249
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:07,089
has found that users don't often notice

250
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,560
URLs or they don't really use them to

251
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,270
make security decisions they don't

252
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,239
factor into their mental models very

253
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,730
well so users are left having to parse

254
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,500
these potentially complicated syntax e

255
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,940
strings with all of these symbols

256
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,020
to make sure they're on the right site

257
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,720
so we wanted to ask the question does

258
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,819
highlighting or extracting different

259
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,430
parts of the URL as we display it to

260
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,470
users help them understand site identity

261
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,359
better so we conducted another survey

262
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,760
experiment to learn whether more

263
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,860
pronounced URL formatting changes in the

264
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,170
browser address bar could help draw

265
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,530
attention to the URL and help users

266
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,540
understand its security properties so we

267
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:51,490
showed participants a page with a Google

268
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:54,949
sign-in form and an on Google URL

269
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,710
specifically the registerable domain in

270
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,540
this URL is tinyurl.com with a whole

271
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:02,270
bunch of noise on both sides of it and

272
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,310
we randomly assign participants to one

273
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,319
of seven conditions so we have

274
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,000
conditions that are roughly like we

275
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,580
display it today and a whole bunch of

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,770
variations where we highlighted the

277
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,560
registerable domain or we hid other non

278
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,270
relevant parts of the URL we bolded the

279
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,160
registerable domain and we did all sorts

280
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,590
of things and we asked participants

281
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,870
first to identify the website that they

282
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,220
were being showed and then asked them if

283
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,130
they would be comfortable entering their

284
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,510
login credentials on the site few

285
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,220
participants and noticed anything

286
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,010
strange about the website when they were

287
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,200
asked to identify it about 85% of all

288
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:41,150
participants just said the site is

289
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:43,250
Google when asked why they reported

290
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,560
feeling somewhat or very comfortable

291
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,600
with the page the majority of responses

292
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,420
described looking at cues in the content

293
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,350
area this looks like a legitimate Google

294
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,510
sign-in form participants justified

295
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,580
their comfort by saying the page looked

296
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,550
familiar or that they trusted Google's

297
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,800
security notably even in open-ended

298
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,439
responses where participants appear to

299
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,459
have been looking at the URL they didn't

300
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,040
necessarily notice any oddities of all

301
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,780
the variations that we tested showing

302
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,810
only the registerable domain left

303
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,670
aligned next to the lock icon stood out

304
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,099
as the most distinct users cited

305
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,560
oddities in the URL and general safety

306
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,080
concerns at a disproportionate rate

307
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,699
compared to other conditions but when we

308
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,720
actually did statistical significance

309
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,430
testing on it

310
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,880
it's still not statistically significant

311
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:39,589
so what now we try all of these things

312
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,270
with our existing identity indicators

313
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,160
but kind of based on our results here

314
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,220
and our review of prior research in the

315
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,709
space we think we need more radical

316
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,030
redesigns in how we think about website

317
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,010
identity indicators and how we

318
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,910
communicate this information to users to

319
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,390
help them make security decisions so a

320
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,250
decade of evu I still falls short due to

321
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,830
users not noticing a lack of positive

322
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,110
indicators our results showed that users

323
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,900
don't interact don't act differently in

324
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,000
its absence suggesting that an Eevee

325
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,439
certificate does not provide a good

326
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,820
defense against phishing or social

327
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,710
engineering some users may not notice it

328
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,690
I'm sorry some users may notice it but

329
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,960
they don't base security decisions on it

330
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,210
and our survey results suggest that

331
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,190
recent proof-of-concept attacks would

332
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,730
likely be effective against users in the

333
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,100
wild

334
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:35,780
if adversaries started using them and

335
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,270
simple URL tweaks don't seem to be

336
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,240
enough to make URLs good site identity

337
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,150
indicators for the average user but at

338
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,590
the same time origin of the page is our

339
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:50,720
fundamental security boundary on the web

340
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,710
so to try to be a little bit

341
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
forward-looking

342
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,150
I suggest we should prefer active

343
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,710
negative indicators to passive positive

344
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,140
indicators we should try to apply the

345
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,880
same lessons that we learned working on

346
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,050
connection security indicators to

347
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,030
identity indicators again a user only

348
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:12,290
has to not notice the lack of a positive

349
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:13,790
indicator once to lose so while we've

350
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,829
kind of figured out connection security

351
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,680
indicators it's an open problem of how

352
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,520
do we think about negative indicators

353
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,170
when it comes to identity an example of

354
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,240
something that Chrome is experimenting

355
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,680
with is our new look-alike warning which

356
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,760
tries to help users when we think they

357
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,339
might be on a confusing URL so we

358
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,170
currently have this for URLs that a user

359
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,320
has previously visited and they try to

360
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,060
visit something similar but not quite

361
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,120
we'll try to guide them to the where we

362
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,349
think they were trying to go so instead

363
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,800
of showing them

364
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,990
DNS host not found error or them landing

365
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,930
on a phishing page we try to route them

366
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,000
to the real URL and by showing an

367
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,310
interstitial warning page we bring this

368
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,200
to the attention of the user before the

369
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,729
content of the page is shown which was

370
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,520
often cited by participants in our

371
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,310
studies as motivating their comfort with

372
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,860
a potentially malicious page and we give

373
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,800
the user a clear call-to-action that

374
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,630
will get them back to a known site so

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,040
we're still exploring and expanding

376
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,930
these kinds of protections and there's

377
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,730
definitely more things and more research

378
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:25,160
that we haven't thought even to try yet

379
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,370
so we should think about prominent UI as

380
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,959
valuable space in the browser this can

381
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,380
benefit us both by focusing user

382
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,210
attention on things that matter and also

383
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,130
as an opportunity for user education we

384
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,120
can draw their attention to things when

385
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,600
it really matters

386
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,780
in comparison the edu I can take up a

387
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,520
lot of space in the omnibox especially

388
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,130
for sites with long legal entity names

389
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,140
like The Washington Post

390
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,030
so while prior attempts at user

391
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,880
education about identity indicators has

392
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,250
been mixed in the past we think if we

393
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,689
start opening up to more radical ideas

394
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,680
we might be able to help focus user

395
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,959
attention when it matters and finally

396
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,209
through anything that we work on and

397
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,160
propose and try to roll out we should

398
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,260
focus on user research so that we

399
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,170
understand the impact of website

400
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,849
identity indicators as they're coming

401
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,800
out and we understand whether we're

402
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,639
actually helping users understand the

403
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,209
sites they visit

404
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,339
so both telemetry and user studies give

405
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:30,560
us unique insight into whether and how

406
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:32,120
users understand and use them so while

407
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,980
current website identity indicators may

408
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,449
fall short we hope to see interesting

409
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,680
new ideas for helping users understand

410
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,570
website identity and for keeping users

411
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,620
safe on a vibrant healthy web ecosystem

412
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,620
thank you

413
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,549
all right time for a couple of questions

414
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:57,929
I have to fix my engine light when I go

415
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:59,039
home thank you for the talk Nikki Nikki

416
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,279
for a Q Stony Brook

417
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,789
so about near the end you suggested some

418
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,740
potential negative indicators you may

419
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:10,140
already know this so I think six or

420
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,480
seven years ago adblock plus tried to

421
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,070
protect its users by essentially

422
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,510
flagging when they were about to visit

423
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:20,189
the URL that was similar right it may

424
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,990
have been like a lower ranked URL

425
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,210
compared to another URL with a

426
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,220
Levenstein distance of one that was much

427
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,529
higher ranked right and they had a slew

428
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,070
of complaints right from benign

429
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:33,750
companies that happen to be close to a

430
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,149
popular domain right but just lower

431
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,770
ranked because essentially they would

432
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:41,129
stop users from actually visiting them

433
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:43,200
right so I think you need to take a

434
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,570
great deal of care here because you may

435
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,940
end up penalizing the small guys right

436
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,889
who are actually low in elect Alexa

437
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,980
rankings and just happen to be

438
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,230
syntactically close to the popular

439
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,450
domains yes so this is a very good point

440
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,399
and this is part of why we're

441
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,770
approaching these things slowly and

442
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:03,059
carefully so one way that we're when

443
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,000
we're rolling these out is we're very

444
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,500
careful about analyzing false positives

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,130
actually looking at what kinds of sites

446
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,529
would this trigger on setting our

447
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,360
heuristics appropriately and monitoring

448
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:20,010
things in the wild of how it's

449
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,360
triggering the other part is the way it

450
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,820
currently works is it's entirely based

451
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,199
on users prior browsing history

452
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,689
basically so we're doing it locally on

453
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,510
the client and if you have previously

454
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,190
visited at engaged with a site then this

455
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,240
will never trigger on that site right

456
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,240
can I ask one more question

457
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,390
richard roberts university of maryland I

458
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:45,440
was hoping could you go into a little

459
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:48,830
bit more detail about how you compare a

460
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,110
particular domain the similarity of that

461
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,389
domain to a domain that a user may have

462
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,659
previously yeah so the simplest

463
00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:01,490
heuristics are things like being off by

464
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:03,620
a character so the particular example on

465
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,270
this is not something that I implemented

466
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,770
so I can't list off the top of my head

467
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,539
the full set of heuristics but I'm happy

468
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:14,240
to chat more offline yeah Tim Callen

469
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,908
sect egos so you use the example of the

470
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,559
check engine light and this reminds me

471
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:22,220
of course of the not secured message

472
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,190
which means are you considering doing

473
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,200
something similar with verified identity

474
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,150
so there would be an indicator that the

475
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,490
identity of this business is not known

476
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,390
and then that would be absent if the

477
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:41,150
identity is known so there is a whole

478
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:44,210
slew of like policy and verification

479
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:48,610
things that we think fall a little short

480
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:52,539
and there's definitely a wide range of

481
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:55,070
potential future options in the space of

482
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,960
what is actually useful to a user to

483
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,360
tell them when something is missing that

484
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,390
is expected in terms of identity

485
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,320
verification or trying to actually build

486
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,100
mappings to entities that actually

487
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,320
matter to users but that's a really hard

488
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,320
problem that we need engagement with the

489
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,240
entire ecosystem to try to come up with

490
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,030
something that might actually work okay

491
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:26,500
thanks all right let's thank Chris

492
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,500
[Applause]
