1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,510
thank you for the introduction my talk

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,279
today will be about understand

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,439
West Beach Carter fing through hidden UI

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,150
analysis this work was done in

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,189
collaboration with Indiana University

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:29,829
and picking University while we use our

7
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:33,400
phone or computers we meet a lot of fake

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:35,890
information fake reviews fake news fake

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,269
accounts fake app reviews are good

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:42,309
examples such fake information are

11
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:44,940
propagated through a model called crowd

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:48,578
turfing crowd turfing is basically

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,709
malicious crowd sourcing it is illicit

14
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,260
business model in which cyber criminals

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,210
recruit small-time workers to carry out

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,269
malicious tasks for dishonest third

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,789
parties in other words there they just

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:06,160
hire a large number of users to perform

19
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:07,660
malicious tests online crowd surfing is

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,970
supported by a crowd trafficking

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,840
platform which consists of a server and

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,850
a client as shown in the figure as

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,910
mentioned cyber criminals takes requests

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,640
from the dishonest third parties and

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,360
pushes tasks to clients which is further

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,459
executed by small-time workers prior

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,160
research have studied web-based router

28
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:34,690
f---ing which only utilizes desktop

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,000
clients however we are the first to

30
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,869
study mobile client based car turfing to

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,390
the best of our knowledge mobile crowd

32
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,660
surfing is becoming more important as

33
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:50,170
mobile uses is on the rise according to

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:54,220
recent reports 58% of network visits are

35
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,050
from mobile devices in 2018 while

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,899
web-based crowd surfing platforms are

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,759
simply hosted on websites mobile crowd

38
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:04,539
surfing requires an app to be installed

39
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,000
in the user's device to successfully

40
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:09,280
accomplish the malicious tasks it is

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,680
very important for the cyber criminals

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,500
to reach a large number of underground

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,340
workers however such crowd surfing apps

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,730
are banned from popular app stores such

45
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,020
as Google Play or Apple App Store

46
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,129
when ster reported they're immediately

47
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,129
removed from the App Store

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,609
in this research we found crowd surfing

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,320
apps that still infiltrate the app store

50
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,140
they basically hide the cryo turfing UI

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,290
behind a benign looking light app during

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,619
the app review process the screenshot

53
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,380
and the slide is a good example it is a

54
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,640
typical cloud turfing app left side is a

55
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,280
word game UI the first is the game list

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,480
and the second is the game the actual

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,390
game UI the app description only

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,320
mentions the word game the right side is

59
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,760
a car turfing UI it is a list of tasks

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:14,820
that can be performed by the user it is

61
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,989
only shown under when specific

62
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,940
conditions are met the goal of this

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,890
project is to first develop a triage

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,460
methodology to identify crowd-surfing

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,890
apps secondly we also aim to provide new

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,840
understanding on mobile crowd turfing

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,600
ecosystem as we just saw crowd turfing

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,730
UI are hidden inside benign apps and

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,430
only get triggered when specific

70
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,010
conditions are met even when they show

71
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,310
up their functionality are very similar

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,870
to benign like benign apps they don't

73
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,100
download an email moer

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,140
they don't download any malicious

75
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,430
payload they don't use any sensitive api

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,799
or a private API this makes it very

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,180
difficult to use traditional

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,930
signature-based methodology to detect

79
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,760
them a simple approach is to let human

80
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,030
actually look at the content and decide

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,769
whether if it's related to crowd surfing

82
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:18,120
however that is not feasible during the

83
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:19,890
app vetting process we built or because

84
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,340
of that we built our detection approach

85
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,650
based on the two key ideas we make you

86
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,359
the fact that crowd Rafi new I are

87
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,049
conditionally triggered and are

88
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,240
semantically related to crowd turfing

89
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,240
let's take a closer look with an example

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,510
the left side is a code that we got from

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,330
a real crowd turing app and the right

92
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,310
side is

93
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,650
a labeled view control graph that we

94
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,370
used to analyze the UI transitioning of

95
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:53,080
the app as you can see in the first

96
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:56,520
green box the app when it received a

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,080
scheme after parsing it it'll decide

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,068
what value is just set to us or in

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,409
variable and when the app is opened

100
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,919
depending on what type of error value is

101
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:12,479
set to the variable it'll trigger either

102
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:19,690
the crowd-surfing UI or the benign UI

103
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:21,159
and as you can see the first set of

104
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,789
keywords extracted from the crowd

105
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:28,180
trapping UI is obviously related to

106
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:31,360
crowd turfing task cache earn withdrawal

107
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,360
join paper work the second set of

108
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,849
keywords album singer shuffle song music

109
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,090
radio is obviously related to music

110
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:41,919
player more details about the labeled

111
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:47,590
view control graph can be found in our

112
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:49,568
paper using such observation we came up

113
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,460
with our detection tool cruiser which

114
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,690
consists of a structure a minor and a

115
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,359
semantic analyzer the structure minor

116
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:01,379
takes an app downloaded from the App

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,270
Store either input disassembles it and

118
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,099
analyzes its UI transitioning using the

119
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,818
label view controller graphic that I

120
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:11,949
just shown after analyzing the label

121
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,770
view control graph it'll come up with a

122
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:18,219
set of suspicious UI when we see

123
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,609
suspicious UI we mean potential crowd

124
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:26,349
turfing UI once the suspicious UI are

125
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:29,800
given the semantic analyzer will analyze

126
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:31,659
the semantics of the suspicious UI to

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,900
confirm whether if it's a crowd riffing

128
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:39,729
UI or not the structure minor is built

129
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,679
based on the fact that the set of crowd

130
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:45,279
riffing you I are totally different from

131
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,459
the set of benign UI we search for apps

132
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,889
that have more than one entry you ice if

133
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,719
there are more than one entry UI the

134
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,970
main UI can be changed based on certain

135
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:56,740
conditions

136
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,050
we also look for uisce that are not

137
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,880
triggered by users intermediate you ice

138
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,490
that are triggered by certain conditions

139
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,990
for example a URL scheme are considered

140
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,060
as suspicious UI let's take a look at

141
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,670
the semantic analyzer given the

142
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,400
suspicious UI as an input the semantic

143
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,170
analyzer focuses on deciding whether the

144
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,400
suspicious UI are indeed crowd-surfing

145
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,170
UI by doing a simple similarity check

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,810
for that purpose we extract the keywords

147
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:28,720
from the suspicious who I said that we

148
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,230
received from the structure minor we

149
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,210
apply clustering algorithms purifying

150
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,680
techniques and finally apply work to

151
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,830
vector changes to vector space for

152
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,840
similarity check on the other side to

153
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,870
get the keyword set of crowd turfing we

154
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:48,039
curled the keywords from popular crowd

155
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,230
surfing websites also applied topic

156
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,170
modeling algorithms and did purification

157
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,750
and then applied wort effect then after

158
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,960
having the vectors of both sides we did

159
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,690
a simple similar similarity check using

160
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:04,060
cosine distance you think those approach

161
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:08,050
we confirm whether if it's proud proud

162
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,670
turf in you or not to evaluate the

163
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,530
cruiser we use the good set and the

164
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,540
Bassett for deciding the similarity

165
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:18,340
threshold and then applied cruiser on

166
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:22,150
the unknown set which is 28 k outs from

167
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:25,299
the 28k apps 102 apps are ported and 93

168
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,750
apps were actual crowd surfing apps all

169
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:33,250
93 apps were removed from the app store

170
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:35,710
immediately after reported them so far I

171
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,380
explained what crowd surfing is and how

172
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,220
he detected them now we'll be looking at

173
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,220
the measurement state

174
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,899
we first will look at the crowd surfing

175
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:51,540
value-chain discovered in our research

176
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,839
as mentioned before there are three

177
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,110
parties the dishonest third parties

178
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,720
which requests the malicious tasks such

179
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,940
as app ranking manipulation and there's

180
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,070
the cyber criminal the crowd surfing

181
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,630
platform owner and the workers who

182
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:12,720
actually execute the tasks before going

183
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,250
to details there are the red lines it's

184
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,510
gonna be meaning the money flow the blue

185
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,060
lines are going to be meaning their

186
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,519
mobile crowd turfing flow and the third

187
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,479
black line is going to be explaining the

188
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,040
hit you at hidden UI development besides

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,540
the three major components there are

190
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,399
more components such as the mobile

191
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,260
device used by the workers the

192
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,110
triggering website the promotion channel

193
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:37,829
the crowd turfing app developer and the

194
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,079
app store to establish the crowd

195
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:42,089
referring platform the cyber criminal

196
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,489
will first request the app to a kart

197
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:47,670
riffing app developer once the crowd

198
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,440
surfing app is developed they'll return

199
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,719
the app to the cyber criminal and upload

200
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,120
the app to the App Store and once the

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,380
app gets published the cyber criminal

202
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,480
will be paid once the app is published

203
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,920
in the app store the cyber criminal will

204
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
start to promote the apps there are

205
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,360
multiple promotion channels such as

206
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,820
online communities social networks or

207
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,990
app gateway sites which I will explain

208
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,430
later the workers the users who are

209
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,800
interested in earning money through

210
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,979
crowding will then visit the promotion

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,740
channels and install the app from the

212
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,600
App Store to their device and visit the

213
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,230
triggering website and turned their

214
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,270
crowd surfing app and app into the

215
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,829
actual crowd trip in UI because

216
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,060
initially it's gonna be showing only the

217
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:39,449
benign UI once the crowd turfing

218
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,550
platform is there it'll start the cyber

219
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,589
criminal will start to take requests

220
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,170
from this dishonest third party in this

221
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:50,910
example he's asking the cyber criminal

222
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,620
to manipulate the app ranking and the

223
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,490
cyber criminal will push the test the

224
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,020
mobile client

225
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,980
the workers will execute the task

226
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,100
basically install the app and leave

227
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:08,590
review once the tests are verified the

228
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:10,270
cybercriminal will pay the workers this

229
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,090
is a summary a quick summary of our

230
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,689
findings the newly discovered 93 apps

231
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:20,530
were related to 67 crowd-surfing

232
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:22,720
platforms among the 93 apps 6 apps were

233
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:26,140
in the top 20 of the Apple App Store in

234
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,630
across different countries 14 apps were

235
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,550
once ranked in the top 50 and 25 apps

236
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,540
were in the top 100 of their

237
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,760
corresponding categories the crowd

238
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,750
turfing apps we discovered were found

239
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,390
from 15 categories the FOB top 5

240
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,050
categories are music utilities lifestyle

241
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,780
entertainment and games while it was

242
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,849
found across 15 app categories most of

243
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,780
them come from the top 5 we think it's

244
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,930
because the crowd turfing app developers

245
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,089
are they do not want to spend much time

246
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,069
on developing that the benign part of

247
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,380
the app so they basically make use of

248
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,640
open source projects or template apps

249
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,320
found from github or blogs I guess to

250
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,180
understand how car turfing platform

251
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,600
owners spread such apps and recruit

252
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,329
workers

253
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,220
we searched the app names that we

254
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,020
discovered in our research on Google

255
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,720
search engine we just threw that

256
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,150
approach we discovered 50 channels that

257
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,100
advertised crowd-surfing apps most of

258
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,650
them are as I mentioned before online

259
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,280
communities social networks and gateway

260
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,230
sites gateway sites are basically crowd

261
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,819
turfing app aggregation website but it's

262
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,080
not a complete list and if you're

263
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:43,230
interested please don't lean you know I

264
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:45,850
can talk about it at breaktime also

265
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,380
based on the download number of

266
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,340
downloads recorded in the crowd surfing

267
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,930
gateway websites we found that the crowd

268
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,530
surfing apps were downloaded more than

269
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:59,800
30 2.4 million times

270
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:03,010
also 23% of the apps discovered include

271
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,069
an in-app referral feature the user is

272
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:09,300
paid for referring the cart reffing app

273
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,300
to other users

274
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,299
the following are the top six

275
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:17,478
crowd-surfing tasks found in a research

276
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:19,119
as we can see here while most of them

277
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:22,909
are similar to web-based crowd surfing

278
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:26,720
the first one ranking manipulation is

279
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:28,399
included in most mobile client apps this

280
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,229
makes sense because app ranking

281
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,329
manipulation can only be done through a

282
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:34,009
mobile client because the app actually

283
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,449
needs to be installed in the phone and

284
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:41,839
sometimes they request them to even

285
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:44,959
leave a review also while most have few

286
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,229
updates still a large portion of them

287
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,029
were reaching a high version number this

288
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:52,699
is interesting because every time they

289
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,729
submit a new version they need to go

290
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:57,079
through the review process again this

291
00:13:55,729 --> 00:14:00,549
means that Apple does not have a

292
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:03,498
systematic way to detect such apps yet

293
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,959
to measure the task volume of the app we

294
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:08,839
crawled five apps task information

295
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,399
manually and the number of required

296
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,329
workers through their car tracking you

297
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,419
ice by multiplying the tasks daily task

298
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:21,559
volume to the per task price we can get

299
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:26,598
a number of 5000 $889 so the lower bound

300
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:28,789
of the crowd turfing platform owner the

301
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:34,909
cybercriminal will be five thousand

302
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:37,699
eight hundred eighty nine dollars we

303
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:40,609
also studied how such apps were hiding

304
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:46,728
their UI let's begin with how they are

305
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:49,819
developed the by searching google with

306
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:51,259
the app names we found that the crowd

307
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,689
surfing platform owner is the

308
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:55,549
cybercriminals were willing to pay up to

309
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:58,699
four hundred fifty dollars for getting

310
00:14:55,549 --> 00:15:01,489
an illicit app that is capable of hiding

311
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:05,358
the crowd surfing UI to pass the app

312
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:06,979
review process crowd surfing apps were

313
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:09,319
often built based on an open source

314
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:11,089
project as mentioned before such

315
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:14,569
templates can be found in blogs or

316
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:17,619
github interestingly six apps were based

317
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:20,478
on the same music player template and

318
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:21,500
there are some other findings that I

319
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:24,260
will just shortly

320
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,410
due to time limit we also study the

321
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,920
triggers the UI was triggered based on

322
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,870
logic bomb CG server schemes many apps

323
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,910
were resubmitted only after changing

324
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,100
their bundle ID under it under a

325
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,810
different developer ID also

326
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,880
crowd-surfing platforms on multiple

327
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:45,140
crowd riffing apps for more details

328
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,640
please read the paper takeaways we tried

329
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,490
to provide new understanding on mobile

330
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,830
crowd riffing ecosystem we also provide

331
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,470
new techniques based on hidden UI for

332
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,470
evading app without betting thank you

333
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:11,660
thank you eunjin for fascinating work

334
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:17,000
please step up ask questions state your

337
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,100
Anatoly ben-gurion University Israel

338
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,580
thank you for the talk I was wondering

339
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,640
you had mentioned in 9 apps that you

340
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:36,850
were figured out that false positive out

341
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:46,010
a hundred of - this is a huge number for

342
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:48,560
malicious for wrong identification have

343
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:53,230
you tried to analyze while that

344
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:58,339
considered such a crowd laughing

345
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:00,950
applications so one reason why we call

346
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:03,620
they told a triage methodologies because

347
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,680
of the false detection rate instead of a

348
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,490
detecting tool and the false positives

349
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,860
were also a lot of a lot of them were

350
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,760
related to malicious activities they

351
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:19,399
were not hiding crowd turfing functions

352
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,260
but they were hiding phishing UI or they

353
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,900
were hiding some other malicious

354
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,550
activities that are currently under work

355
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,490
in our follow-up work actually so so

356
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,340
those false positives are not related to

357
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,060
power tripping but it's still related to

358
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,389
some malicious

359
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:42,649
so you actually don't search for the

360
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,240
it's a undergoing work and okay thank

361
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:50,480
you them and we'll probably some hit it

362
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:52,820
soon yeah hello I'm Steven Chevy from

363
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,200
Middle Tennessee State University you

364
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,360
mentioned that the apps don't use any

365
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,190
sort of private API is that indicating

366
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,760
they're not communicating with some sort

367
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,120
of central control server from the code

368
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,520
turfing people or is it that like these

369
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,330
texts are embedded in app updates which

370
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,820
may explain the high update frequency so

371
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,590
I think I didn't understand your

372
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,500
question clearly because it was a little

373
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,000
bit not loud enough oh sorry the you

374
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,370
mentioned that they do not use private

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,740
API right private does that mean that

376
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,050
they're not submitting tasks to a

377
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,480
private API server that they own oh no

378
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,169
no I'm talking about the private API and

379
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,060
the sensitive API so that are used by

380
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,460
malicious apps in Android or iOS because

381
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,710
in malware research when we talk about

382
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,270
private APN sensitive API

383
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,640
this usually API is that access

384
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,040
sensitive data and the in the phone like

385
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:51,040
for example like the contacts or the

386
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:54,530
location or etc okay thank you okay so

387
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:58,330
let's thank all our speakers on Fabio Yi

388
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,330
and Yong Jun thank again
