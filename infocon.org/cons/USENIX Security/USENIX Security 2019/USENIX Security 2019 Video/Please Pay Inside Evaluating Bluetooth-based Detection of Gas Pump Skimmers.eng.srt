1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,799
good afternoon everyone I'm nishan

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,410
Bhaskar from University of California

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,050
San Diego and today I am here to present

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,630
the results of a 19 month long study in

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,759
which we try to evaluate if Bluetooth

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,770
scanning from a smartphone can be used

7
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:28,739
as a mechanism to detect the presence of

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,939
payment card skimmers in gas pumps this

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,680
work was done in collaboration with

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,600
Maxwell bland and kilduff chenko at

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,719
University of Illinois and my advisor

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,700
Erin Schulman now a skimmer is a small

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,610
electronic device that criminals plant

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,130
inside payment terminals to record and

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,990
steal your card data and if you think

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,660
about it the most pervasive form of

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,260
payment terminals is actually gas pumps

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,819
and so no wonder that the card skimming

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,760
at gas stations has become a huge

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,440
problem today several skimmers have been

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,649
recovered in gas stations all across the

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,319
US and the numbers are increasing for

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,200
instance in Florida last year there were

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,750
972 gas from skimmers recovered and 148

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,930
in Arizona which in itself is a 50%

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,640
increase over the previous year and the

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,760
reason for this is because skimming is a

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,580
very profitable business a single gas

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,380
from skimmer can capture 3200 unique

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,750
payment cards in just one day of

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,869
operation which effectively translates

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,220
to more than 16 million dollars of

33
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,190
estimated fraud from the skimmers

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,539
recovered in Florida and Arizona

35
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,530
assuming they just operated for one day

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,060
so this is a huge number and so while

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,760
these criminals actually targeting gas

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,220
stations and gas pumps simply because

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,740
gas pumps are have really weak physical

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,920
security the DOS can be open quite

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,750
easily using either a crowbar or a

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,909
universal key and once the door is open

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,640
the card data is transmitted in the

44
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,930
clear on the payment circuitry add to

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,610
that the fact that gas stations have

46
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,140
really poor video surveillance makes

47
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,840
them an ideal target for performing

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,290
skimming so what are these skimming

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,729
devices that these criminals are using

50
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,590
they are what we call internal gas from

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,930
skimmers a term that are just reduced at

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,870
using security last year and they are a

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,939
very basic embedded system they can be

54
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,190
built using off-the-shelf parts on the

55
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,660
top is an photo of a skimmer that was

56
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,640
recovered during the course of our study

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,760
and as you can see it's just a

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,579
microcontroller dev board with an SD

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,799
card for storage and this micro dev

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,630
board can be programmed in arduino there

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,510
are I Oh connectors to go to the card

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,130
reader and the keypad and Crimmins also

63
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,350
installed a bluetooth to serial module

64
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,410
for wireless li connecting and

65
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,290
extracting the Solan data and the

66
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,209
installation procedure of this schema is

67
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,220
pretty straightforward all the criminals

68
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,690
have to do is basically remove the card

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,630
reader connection to the payment

70
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,160
processor attach the skimmer in line so

71
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,959
that they can passively read the card

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,180
data every time someone swipes a card

73
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,450
and that's pretty much it

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,920
and once this bump door is closed these

75
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,980
things are completely hidden inside you

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,329
can't even see them visually and this

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,040
whole installation procedure actually

78
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,390
can also be done quite quickly so the

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
all the criminals really have to do is

80
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,559
basically open the gas pump door the

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,299
payment circuitry is right on the door

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,830
as you can see the card readers on the

83
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,480
left and the keypad on the right

84
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,950
the criminal just pops open the card

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,410
reader cable attaches the skimmer

86
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,750
attaches a keypad tap and hides the

87
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,670
skimmer neatly in the crevice and they

88
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,070
can do all of this in under 30 seconds

89
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,929
which makes it virtually impossible to

90
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,299
detect someone in the act of planting a

91
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,579
skimmer not only that once these

92
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,650
skimmers are actually installed it's

93
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,739
really hard to detect where these

94
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,329
cameras are at because just inspecting a

95
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,540
bunch of different gas pumps is a very

96
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,310
tedious process there are a lot of gas

97
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,720
stations out there and skimmers are only

98
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,670
installed in a small number of them

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,070
which basically becomes a needle in a

100
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,570
haystack problem and so for instance in

101
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,880
Arizona they did over seven thousand

102
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,760
three hundred inspections from 2016 to

103
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,549
2018 but could finds skimmers in only

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,489
1.5 percent of the cases which is a lot

105
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,140
of wasted effort and the common

106
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,180
detection mechanisms that they use at

107
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,760
gas stations for saying if the pump door

108
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,108
was open such as using tamper proof

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,380
seals have been found to be ineffective

110
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,870
as well okay so now you may think that

111
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,340
you know what they'll come back to

112
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,229
collect the stolen data at some point

113
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,330
right and so at one of these times we'll

114
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:32,430
catch them right but the problem is that

115
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,710
blue total serial module enables them to

116
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,300
inconspicuously to retrieve the stolen

117
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,770
card data because all they have to

118
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,629
really do

119
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,060
is scanned for their nearby Bluetooth

120
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,389
devices and then connect to their

121
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,889
skimmer and download the card data and

122
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,659
which means that it's really hard to

123
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,860
even catch them even downloading the

124
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,680
data because they can do it from the

125
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,720
comfort of their vehicle and so what can

126
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,210
we do now really I mean how do we even

127
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,250
detect if these things are present well

128
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,099
let Lou do the schema a brutal serial

129
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,840
model actually provides us an insight

130
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:04,280
because if think about it if the

131
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,258
criminals can scan for these things

132
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,340
using their smartphones then you know

133
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,789
why don't we do the same

134
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,609
it's a neat idea and you know looks good

135
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:16,039
but the thing is I mean is that even

136
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,229
possible can we even like just go around

137
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,180
with smartphones and you know be able to

138
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:22,490
find these schemas do it does everything

139
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,280
look like schemers it's it's not clear

140
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,020
at the moment so the can we actually use

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,969
smartphones to even detect these without

142
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,590
opening the gas pumps and I think the

143
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,599
only way to answer this question is just

144
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,330
go to a bunch of different gas form a

145
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,009
gas stations collect Bluetooth scans and

146
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,979
you know try to find some skimmers and

147
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,969
so that's what exactly what we did so

148
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,409
I'm going to talk about a data

149
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:44,360
collection methodology in which we

150
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,909
designed this custom a brutal scanning

151
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,610
app called glutton a-- and then we you

152
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:51,740
we got we use forty four officials from

153
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,110
who are basically gas in station

154
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,000
inspectors and outfitted them with cheap

155
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,469
smartphones and this app to collect

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,050
bluetooth scans and if there were

157
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:02,930
suspect devices they also inspected the

158
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,719
pumps so we I talked about the app the

159
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,419
app is basically an Android based app

160
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:10,550
that uses the Bluetooth device discovery

161
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,190
api's and it can run on a very

162
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,180
inexpensive Android phone and it records

163
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,560
all the Bluetooth scan responses and

164
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,110
approach them to a server for analysis

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,199
and also updates the UI with the devices

166
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,909
seen but we needed to actually point out

167
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,650
to these gas station inspectors that hey

168
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,599
there's a suspect device there right so

169
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,969
we needed to we perform this

170
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,719
highlighting procedure and so how do we

171
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:37,490
like call something a suspect so we know

172
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,349
that there are these two basic classes

173
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,849
of modules that are predominantly found

174
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,770
in the skin was recovered in the field

175
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,750
which are the are and in the eight C

176
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,729
style modules and what we did was we

177
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,259
looked at their default configurations

178
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,539
and due to how they look like in

179
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,190
Bluetooth scans and identify three pair

180
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,350
by which you can identify them pretty

181
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,050
well the first is the class of device

182
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,400
now class of device actually is a sort

183
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,530
of indicator for the intended

184
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,599
application of a Bluetooth device so

185
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,760
there it will have values like smart

186
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,280
phone for a phone a hands-free for you

187
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,039
know a hands-free thing but for these

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,989
Bluetooth modules the manufacturer

189
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,630
actually leaves the class of devices and

190
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,190
categorized now the Mac prefix of the

191
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,350
first three bytes of the Mac indicates

192
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,870
the manufacturer and for our and modules

193
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,680
we saw that they were using the default

194
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,540
I Triple E Mac prefix for HC modules we

195
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,600
saw a wide variety of Mac prefixes and

196
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,800
we'll talk about some of them later

197
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,690
finally the device names on the model

198
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,540
manufacturers assign this sort of a

199
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,450
default name and some actually

200
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,160
legitimate product products actually use

201
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,440
some of these modules and so what

202
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,360
happens is that they change the device

203
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,610
name to make it the product identifier

204
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,290
and actually that's a good good and

205
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,110
piece of information because you can use

206
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,780
that to actually filter out the suspect

207
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,400
you know less suspicious devices and so

208
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,919
that is why if you see the second device

209
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,359
shown in the in the orange is is higher

210
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,860
in orange because it's a known product

211
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,960
whereas the device on the top is

212
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,240
highlighted in red as highly suspicious

213
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,789
and this highlighting procedure is

214
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,580
important because it are not it enables

215
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,370
our gas station or our data collectors

216
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,200
to collect more data and data collecting

217
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,750
more data about these schemas is really

218
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,190
useful because what we can use that to

219
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,930
do signal strength localization and

220
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,120
that's really a great tool when you're

221
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,860
in the field because the schemers will

222
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,740
have really strong signal near the pumps

223
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,900
versus the other devices and so that can

224
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,400
act as a confirmation in fact our data

225
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,740
collectors never actually opened the

226
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,299
pumps to see unless the signal strength

227
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,520
was really strong near the pump itself

228
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,679
and as an example there are two devices

229
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,299
shown near a gas pump at the same time

230
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,010
and the device on the left has a strong

231
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:47,599
signal and therefore most likely a

232
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:50,000
skimmer now on with this tool our data

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
collectors actually went to almost 1200

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,380
gas stations in over six states and

235
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,810
collected bluetooth scans they were able

236
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,630
to detect 64 skimmers and all of these

237
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,609
have been now recovered in this analysis

238
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,740
in which in the results we will also

239
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,520
talk about 23 additional skimmers which

240
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,620
we received from

241
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,449
forcement for analysis and we noticed

242
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,710
that their brutal properties are very

243
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,840
similar to the ones we found in the

244
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,580
field so we're gonna talk about

245
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,740
basically two things how do these

246
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,090
skimmers how do their Bluetooth

247
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,910
properties actually look like

248
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,260
and are they identifiable and more

249
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,060
importantly what about the rest of the

250
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,540
devices what if everything looks pretty

251
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,770
much the same so the first thing we look

252
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,280
at is the class of device for these

253
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,569
skimmers and we saw that all 87 of these

254
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,220
skimmers that we recovered had

255
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,050
uncharacterized class of device and

256
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,300
which is the default left by the

257
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,680
manufacturer so it seems to be quite a

258
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,500
strong property when looking for these

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,020
skimmers now if you look at the Mac

260
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,330
prefixes or the manufacturer so most

261
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,250
cameras use the most Khmers that we saw

262
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,130
use the RN module and had the default

263
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,330
Mac prefix the 80 modules were kind of

264
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,189
interesting because there were a wide

265
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,890
variety of Mac prefixes and could not be

266
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,600
associated with any manufacturer and if

267
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,120
you see here there are some of the

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,980
examples that we have here but if you

269
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,860
look closely and if you can decompose

270
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,060
these Mac first four bytes they actually

271
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,620
look like a date stamp so there's a

272
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,500
definite pattern there that we can use

273
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,630
and finally if you look at the device

274
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,670
names most of the scheme has actually

275
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,780
had a default device name which is the

276
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,939
RM VD or AC or Phi and that was the case

277
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,920
in certain cases we saw as expected you

278
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,210
know the criminals tried to disguise or

279
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,370
customize the device name to make it

280
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,590
look benign but that seemed to have

281
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,920
interestingly a quite a reverse effect

282
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:36,530
because what happened is that so for

283
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,050
example we saw a phone brand which was

284
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,910
an RN module with a none categorize

285
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,880
class of device and that seemed really

286
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,980
suspicious and in some cases we actually

287
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,540
cannot get the device names and this is

288
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,760
basically an artifact of the Bluetooth

289
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,990
scanning mechanism we have because

290
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
device names are obtained in subsequent

291
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,520
packets and so we have to rely on the

292
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,260
other parameters the important takeaway

293
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,510
from this side is that these Bluetooth

294
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,410
parameters combine actually can identify

295
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:06,020
these schemers quite well but this is

296
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,850
not that useful unless you know because

297
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,770
what this is this won't be useful if

298
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,720
everything else also looks exactly the

299
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:16,010
same what if all the schemers out there

300
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,780
basically look like these devices and so

301
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,140
we had to analyze what the other blue

302
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,850
toad

303
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,360
says seen at gas stations typically look

304
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:25,940
like and so to do so we basically took

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,830
the first visits I've every every time a

306
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,940
gas station was visited the first time

307
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,550
we looked at the number of little

308
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,870
devices there and so the one thing that

309
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,329
stood out was the fact that there are a

310
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,640
lot of little devices as you can see and

311
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,230
they're not that many skimmers so what

312
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,730
are these other two and a half thousand

313
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,190
devices what do they look like

314
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,220
and so we analyze the same little

315
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,260
properties as we did before and so we

316
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,600
start off with the class of device we

317
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,850
see that they there are this is a

318
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,770
histogram depicting the distribution or

319
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,690
the number of devices in each class of

320
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,430
device that we observed and we saw that

321
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,710
there are a lot of devices that are

322
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,060
actually uncharacterized while they

323
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,550
actually can filter out pretty well

324
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,930
amongst the see of devices there there

325
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,180
are still some things which were not

326
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,670
skimmers that are uncharacterized so

327
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,550
what are these we dive further into by

328
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,770
looking at the Mac prefixes now if we

329
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,050
look at the manufacturer distribution we

330
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,079
see for instance the row are in modules

331
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,280
about half of them were actually seen as

332
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,870
skimmers whereas there were a lot of

333
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,780
legitimate products which also used the

334
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,190
are in module and can be confused in if

335
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,050
on the other hand if you look at the

336
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,390
date stamp style MAC addresses almost

337
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,550
all of them were skimmers but there was

338
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,620
this odd device which was not and

339
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,449
finally if we there are some other kinds

340
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,070
of skimmers that we observed some Mac

341
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,160
prefixes which you'll see very rarely

342
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,590
across the gas stations and some Mac

343
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,089
prefixes which we have no idea which man

344
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,710
fractured they belong to or they don't

345
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,080
follow a pattern and we saw some

346
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,390
skimmers in there as well finally

347
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,490
amongst if these Mac prefixes if we look

348
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,560
at how the device name distribution is

349
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,690
that can give us maybe some more clues

350
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,880
and so for instance one of the things

351
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,590
that was there was we can actually there

352
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,600
are a lot of legitimate products that

353
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,120
use the same modules as I use the

354
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,150
skimmers and and we can see that in this

355
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,770
bar here the only schemas that are there

356
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,410
on that bar are the ones where in say

357
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,449
the phone brand was a actual product

358
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,969
name of a product but it was not it was

359
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,570
used in a skimmer for the most part

360
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,290
default

361
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,730
device names actually just actually were

362
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,699
mostly skimmers but there were some

363
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:31,390
legitimate act applications or wherein

364
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,520
they left that default device name

365
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,230
the same as the module there were also

366
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,790
some devices in which there were some

367
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,740
custom names assigned in which we could

368
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,300
not actually figure out what they were

369
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,940
and some of them were skimmers and

370
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,589
finally there was this large number of

371
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,450
devices for which we could not actually

372
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,280
figure out the device name and that's

373
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,500
actually a bit of a disadvantage because

374
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,600
as you can see that less than half of

375
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,190
these were actually skimmers so we have

376
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,250
to rely on only the other properties to

377
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,960
figure out these skimmers or not but the

378
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,480
key takeaway from this analysis is

379
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,670
basically the fact that while there are

380
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,220
legitimate devices that actually look

381
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,810
like skimmers in gas stations their

382
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,730
numbers are quite low and these

383
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,790
properties combined can actually

384
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,790
identify these skimmers quite accurately

385
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,490
and so how accurate is that how

386
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,530
effective can this be so to do that we

387
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,290
did an accuracy analysis of the time

388
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,089
that this our tool was in deployment in

389
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,219
Arizona and because in Arizona weights

390
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,130
and measures they also do the manual

391
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,170
inspection of the gas station we can we

392
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,990
get a sense of like whether it's working

393
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,520
or not and so we act they detected 42

394
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,910
skimmers during this time of which we

395
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,470
missed only 6 and the more important one

396
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,270
is the incorrectly detecting a skimmer

397
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,490
so there were 757 inspections where no

398
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,920
skimmers were found in only 6% of these

399
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,680
did we actually detect something as a

400
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,870
skimmer which makes it quite a useful

401
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,510
mechanism so that actually indicates

402
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,460
that this brutal scanning can be quite

403
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,100
useful especially considering the amount

404
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,430
of time they have to spend on cases

405
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,720
wherein there are no skimmers found now

406
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,729
there are several countermeasures to

407
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,980
this mode of detecting Bluetooth

408
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,840
skimmers Primo's can try switching to

409
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,580
ble or they can be using a non

410
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,800
discoverable bluetooth mode in which we

411
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,840
can't actually get any device discovery

412
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,510
or they could be trying impersonating

413
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,730
any benign devices and we discussed the

414
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,920
cost and responses to this in our paper

415
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:28,060
but the high-level point here is the

416
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,800
fact that this while these things can be

417
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,530
done by the criminals there is honestly

418
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,870
no incentive for them to actually adapt

419
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,790
or change their techniques because while

420
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,280
we have created a mechanism for gas

421
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,199
station inspectors to affect quickly be

422
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,350
able to find skimmers and be able to

423
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,370
actually avoid any missed skimmers the

424
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,019
problem is that

425
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,089
it's still a needle in haystack problem

426
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:51,100
because of Bluto they have to actually

427
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,860
go to the gas station and scan for the

428
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,600
skimmers anyways and so we don't see any

429
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,129
incentive for the criminals to actually

430
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,779
adapt significantly now finally we

431
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,699
learned some important lessons while

432
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:08,139
during the course of this entire study

433
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:10,479
and about the nature of skimming itself

434
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,040
and so for one thing we saw that there

435
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,259
were several skimmers that were detected

436
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,269
at different gas stations which had very

437
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,829
close MAC addresses and by close I mean

438
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,379
the first five bytes are the same and

439
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:23,170
the last byte is differing by some small

440
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,120
number and so and the thing is that very

441
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,729
close MAC addresses are most likely from

442
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
the same source which can actually give

443
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,990
us an insight into how these criminal

444
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,359
gangs operate so for instance we saw two

445
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,819
different devices in the same counties

446
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,370
where at gas stations separated by 17

447
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:41,110
miles which were very close in another

448
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,930
case we saw two different skimmers at

449
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,579
two gas stations separated and the gas

450
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,769
stations were separated by almost 450

451
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,149
miles so we see these patterns where

452
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:51,279
criminals are going from one gas station

453
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:55,389
to another in the same County and also

454
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,240
moving across several counties finally

455
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:01,180
and this is the this is one of the best

456
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,980
results that we got is that the the fact

457
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,510
that there that the gas station

458
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,390
inspectors can quickly scan for these

459
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,789
devices means that they can actually be

460
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,649
doing some other kind of inspection at a

461
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:13,720
gas station and they could just you know

462
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:15,309
quickly do us check and you know if a

463
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,980
suspect device shows up they can do an

464
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,859
inspection and that is exactly how they

465
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,649
did in Arizona in fact they in several

466
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,389
cases they actually just just randomly

467
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:26,829
they were at a gas station for some

468
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:31,149
other inspection and they look at the

469
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:34,030
brute honor app and so what happened is

470
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:35,620
that we do to this process of the 64 33

471
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,570
skimmers were recovered simply because

472
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,139
they saw something highlighted as

473
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:43,120
suspect device in butanna so to conclude

474
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,090
we can say that skimming devices are

475
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,590
really detectable in this entire sea of

476
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,260
various little devices seen at gas

477
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,730
stations and ladonna can actually help

478
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,610
these inspectors find these skimmers

479
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,510
really fast and also help them in

480
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,139
avoiding missing skimmers and

481
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,820
fundamentally what you saw

482
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,710
these lives was that for the most part

483
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,419
criminals are not changing the default

484
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,470
properties of the modules because they

485
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,090
don't really have to and so those actual

486
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,770
behavior of how these gangs are

487
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,480
operating are actually helping us in

488
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,960
finding these skimmers and they may even

489
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,400
indicate their source and one of the the

490
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,170
last thing I want to end with is the

491
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,960
fact that we don't think this problem is

492
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,240
going away anytime soon and to that

493
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,220
point I mean we were we using butanna

494
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,380
inspectors were able to detect six

495
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,160
skimmers in the bay area at a gas

496
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,720
station just last week and before I end

497
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,150
I would like to thank or the various

498
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,820
data the various weights and measures

499
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,280
inspection agencies who did all this

500
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,600
enormous data collection for us and the

501
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,670
law enforcement agencies who actually

502
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,639
guided us and provided us an insight

503
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:55,470
into this world of skimming thank you

504
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:59,010
[Applause]

505
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,960
so thank you for the talk one question

506
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:06,070
if you know where a device is very

507
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,020
skimmer is why don't you try to find the

508
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,470
person installing the skimmer or reading

509
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,080
data from the skimmer by just seeing if

510
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:17,140
there is a connect request I mean I know

511
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,350
it's hard to observe it like just

512
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,810
visually but if you have the signal

513
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:28,379
spectrum and analyze it you could find

514
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:30,730
the person so the way I understand is is

515
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,430
you seeing that what if we were to

516
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,620
actually be sniffing out there and were

517
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,210
to see some sort of a connect request is

518
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,830
that sort of a thing that you're talking

519
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,920
about like a passive eavesdropping kind

520
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,189
of thing exactly so one of the things

521
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,470
that is there is because the way this

522
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,970
skimmer investigation works is that once

523
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,980
you actually detect the skimmer they are

524
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,370
to be removed immediately and submitted

525
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:58,270
into evidence and beyond that actually

526
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,949
and then the thing is this this idea of

527
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,480
actually installing something to

528
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,300
actually be looking for all sorts of

529
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,970
connect requests is we would have to

530
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,560
actually then move on to creating a fake

531
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,230
skimmer which you would have to plant

532
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,810
there and so the thing is these are the

533
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,610
kind of things which actually for the

534
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,490
law enforcement agencies do not allow us

535
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,040
to do I understand your point and it's

536
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,450
actually true but it's it's something

537
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,280
that is not within our purview to

538
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,660
actually try and attempt all right it's

539
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,520
Rick Fehr is wondering if I could get

540
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,620
blue toner for myself so that's a very

541
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,060
good question and in fact that's

542
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,850
something that a lot of people have

543
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,800
actually asked us so one of the one of

544
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,540
the things that if you have seen from

545
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,040
the slides is one of the reasons why we

546
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,050
don't want our outsource this and limit

547
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,440
this to only these inspection agencies

548
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:54,370
is because there are actually legitimate

549
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,530
devices at gas stations which can look

550
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,600
like skimmers and so by actually

551
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,970
outsourcing it to the public it can just

552
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,280
lead to more sort of panic because and

553
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,750
unlike the gas station inspectors who if

554
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,610
they see something suspect they just

555
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,830
actually do an investigation they OH

556
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,899
the skimmer check the pump and check if

557
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,309
the skimmer and so we want to limit it

558
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,049
to that the other thing why we don't

559
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,610
want to crowd source is because there

560
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:17,559
are these mechanisms by which we

561
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,120
highlight devices and there are these

562
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,190
devices which we know unless MIT

563
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,260
products and so actually having the app

564
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,340
out there sort of makes it easier for

565
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,650
the criminals to sort of reverse

566
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,419
engineer and totally change the way they

567
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,340
are operating so there is this sort of

568
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,010
anonymity that's helping us in fact if

569
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,959
we look at Chaffey and all paper from

570
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,200
Oakland 20 19 that's exactly what they

571
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,090
did

572
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,440
there were skimmer apps out there in the

573
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,580
Play Store they were able to reverse

574
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,990
engineer to figure out what they were

575
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,149
doing yeah we could do it without the

576
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,990
app well one comment about your paper

577
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:48,700
you're off by two orders of magnitude

578
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,049
car stolen car credit cards in the

579
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,640
United States according to McAfee over

580
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:56,500
five dollars not $500 I'm sorry stolen

581
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,150
credit cards in the US on the on the

582
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,059
criminal market I looked up all you're

583
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,160
talking five dollars each so there are

584
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:06,190
there are two aspects to this so one is

585
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,190
actually the so if you go on carding

586
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,590
forums and try to buy a card a stolen

587
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,710
card that actually yes it's anywhere

588
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,418
between $10 and $200 and that depends on

589
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,429
the value of the card is dependent on

590
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:19,780
whether you just have the card info or

591
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,510
you have the pin number and zip code or

592
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,340
not but the the values what I'm talking

593
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,410
about is the the actual money that

594
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,418
happens in this value chain is at the

595
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,030
cash out and so what criminals can

596
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:33,130
actually do is cash out these debit and

597
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,260
credit cards that they get and for them

598
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,809
for and for those there is a much more

599
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,460
value we have analyzed in fact in our

600
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,740
paper we have analyzed that part where

601
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,309
we looked at different code documents of

602
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,720
skimming cases we looked at some online

603
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,879
reports where they talked about the

604
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,679
potential fraud that happens due to

605
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,530
cashing out or the bank and merchants

606
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:57,400
loss and that number 500 is actually a

607
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,750
good middle figure for then various

608
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,090
numbers that we observed and we have

609
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,910
done this sort of analysis in the paper

610
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,120
in section 2 actually great let's thank

611
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,120
you

612
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,280
you
