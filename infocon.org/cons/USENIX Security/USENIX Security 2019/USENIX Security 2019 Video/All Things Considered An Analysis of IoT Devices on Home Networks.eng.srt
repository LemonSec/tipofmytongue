1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,969
good afternoon thanks for attending this

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,640
session and and yeah thanks Nikita for

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,779
that great introduction today I'm going

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,700
to talk about some work that we've been

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:20,869
doing in the home IOT security space and

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,820
this work is done in collaboration with

7
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:26,029
some great researchers at Avast software

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,619
and Stanford University so we spend a

9
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,750
lot of time as a security community

10
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,040
thinking about securing home IOT devices

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,710
and you know this is for a good reason

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,180
because attackers keep hacking our hair

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,100
straighteners and light bulbs and then

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,630
string them together to launch massive

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,390
DDoS attacks on the internet or whatever

16
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,800
so the media says but what as it turns

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,630
out I'm in spite of all that attention

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,089
on device security or platform security

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,700
we actually have very little insight

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,800
into the home IOT ecosystem as a whole

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,150
and this is not a failing of the

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,919
research community but rather a

23
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,480
measurement perspective challenge right

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,970
so our typical mechanism for learning

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,739
about internet devices is to scan for

26
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,329
them on the public Internet but we can't

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,400
do that for home IOT devices that are

28
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,020
typically behind Nats

29
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,908
however understanding this ecosystem and

30
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,340
its resultant security challenges can

31
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:13,310
help focus our efforts community upon

32
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,260
better protecting people so in this talk

33
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,450
and in this work we sought to answer

34
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,690
this kind of core question and what does

35
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,890
the home IOT ecosystem look like as I

36
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,840
mentioned you know we can't publicly

37
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,790
scan for these devices so we needed a

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
different measurement perspective and to

39
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,390
get that perspective we partnered with

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,370
Avast software who is a free antivirus

41
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,040
provider whose home security software

42
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,049
runs in millions of homes worldwide and

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,840
as part of their home security software

44
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,479
package avast products come packaged

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,549
with a tool called Wi-Fi inspector Wi-Fi

46
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,650
inspector performs internal network

47
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,540
scans of the local network and checks

48
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,220
devices for indicators of weak security

49
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,080
that they then alert to the user so the

50
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,820
user can take care of whatever problems

51
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,070
they have on their network and in total

52
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,529
Wi-Fi inspector does three things so it

53
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,509
does device inventory and identification

54
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,830
which lets the user know what all the

55
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,750
currently connected devices on their

56
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,509
network are and it then probes those

57
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,880
devices for weak default credentials on

58
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,860
popular services and vulnerabilities to

59
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,260
known recent CVEs that they can test

60
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,849
without breaking the device themselves

61
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,840
so to kind of illustrate this I'm going

62
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,970
to walk through a very quick example

63
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,499
let's say this is your home deployment

64
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,930
you've got four devices you've got a

65
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:22,579
router a surveillance camera a smart

66
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,970
thermostat as well as a computer that's

67
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,310
running

68
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,020
asked home security software and so what

69
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,850
the tool does is it starts its process

70
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,700
by actively probing devices an

71
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,920
increasing IP order via ICMP TCP and UDP

72
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,839
and figures out what services are open

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,359
on each device so you know if your

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,600
router might speak HTTP and DNS and

75
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,390
telnet your camera might have FTP and

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,030
SSH and telnet and your thermostat might

77
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,649
have an HTTP server speak UPnP for

78
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,180
device discovery and you know whatever

79
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,590
also want to tell that server because

80
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,670
why not

81
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,620
Wi-Fi inspector that uses this

82
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,660
information to collect application layer

83
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,330
data about each device so for example if

84
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,400
you know port 80 or 443 is open Wi-Fi

85
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,080
inspector will make an HTTP request to

86
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,330
the root page of the device and collect

87
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,100
and store that information it also

88
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,260
collects you know semantically rich

89
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,650
broadcast and multicast traffic via

90
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,329
protocols like DHCP em DNS and UPnP on

91
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,670
the network and it uses all of this

92
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,830
application layer data to basically

93
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,660
perform device identification so the

94
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,830
goal of device ID in this little scope

95
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,990
of this paper and the scope of their

96
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,180
product is to put a device into one of

97
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,650
fourteen different device classes these

98
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,260
are the device classes I'm not going to

99
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,450
say all of them but of these we deem

100
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,850
eleven of them to be IOT devices for the

101
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,350
scope of this work we excluded computers

102
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,269
routers and mobile devices in our

103
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,620
discussion of IOT but we kept them in

104
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,360
the context of you know the number of

105
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,130
devices in the network as well as their

106
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,560
security security posture on the network

107
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,940
so how does device ID work well device

108
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,680
identification works primarily through

109
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,560
two mechanisms the first of which is

110
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,330
what we call network rules which are

111
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,190
essentially regular expressions that

112
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,140
were manually curated by inspecting the

113
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,600
network behavior of a large set of known

114
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,089
devices so in total there are about a

115
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,070
thousand rules in the in the software

116
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,130
over various fields and in practice this

117
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,440
is great at labeling say around 60% of

118
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,269
devices in a random validation set but

119
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
obviously this requires tons of manual

120
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,480
analysis I think in the case of avast

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,640
this was over three years of effort of

122
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,440
looking at packets and trying to extract

123
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,000
regular expressions so what do these

124
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,918
rules look like they look something like

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,229
this so for example if you're able to

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,359
capture the HTTP title of a given device

127
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,880
and that title contains some combination

128
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,380
of Polycom sound point or sound station

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,440
IP or something like that then this

130
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,419
thing is most likely a networked phone

131
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,410
so how do you cover the remaining 40% of

132
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,820
devices then

133
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,890
uses a supervised machine learning

134
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,390
approach over several network properties

135
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,940
to classify the rest of the devices I

136
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,140
want to give you a brief introduction

137
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,540
and a little bit more detail into this

138
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,890
that model is actually an ensemble model

139
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,840
of a number of different models that

140
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,580
leverages various Network features like

141
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,560
the IP address of the device the MAC

142
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,050
address of the device listening services

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,690
and application layer responses as you

144
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,700
know features into each model model was

145
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,260
trained over a label data over labeled

146
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,760
set of 500,000 devices that were

147
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,370
collected from real words real world

148
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,170
scans 200,000 of these were manually

149
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,390
labeled through a clustering and

150
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,860
winnowing process and 300,000 were

151
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,080
labeled by the network rules that I

152
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,630
mentioned before so the model was then

153
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,180
tested on a set of 1,000 manually

154
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,219
labeled never-before-seen devices and in

155
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,440
total the ensemble model is able to

156
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,570
cover about 92% of the devices in the

157
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,340
testing set and is able to classify them

158
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,980
into the appropriate device class with

159
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,960
96% accuracy in an f1 score of 0.08 so

160
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,610
this gives us a reasonable confidence in

161
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,640
its ability to perform device

162
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,750
identification so I want to briefly you

163
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,010
know touch on some of the ethical

164
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,960
considerations that we thought about

165
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,510
when we were running the study so first

166
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,190
a vast only shared with us aggregate

167
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,230
data so they aggregated by device

168
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,180
manufacturer or region and device type

169
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,740
and as a result no personally

170
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,090
identifiable data was ever shared with

171
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,000
the research team so this includes for

172
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,010
example the IP address of your home and

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,540
and finally although avast Wi-Fi

174
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,610
inspector you know does actually run

175
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,110
automatically as part of the product for

176
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,000
our data set scans are all user

177
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,920
initiated and they're never automated

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,270
and we did this because we wanted to

179
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,160
limit the possibility that someone's

180
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,810
data would be used on accident or

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,460
included in the study without their

182
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,810
express knowledge that I've asked was

183
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,739
scanning their network and scanning it

184
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,990
for vulnerabilities

185
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,550
alright cool that's great and this

186
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,290
brings us to our final data set you know

187
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,360
in total our data set consists of

188
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,190
internal network scans collected from

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,620
fifteen point five million homes across

190
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,990
eighty three million devices and 11

191
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,640
geographic regions so this brings us to

192
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,320
what you know answering the first

193
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,419
question we're now well poised to do

194
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,540
this what do home networks actually look

195
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,430
like to start let's take a look at where

196
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,260
the IOT devices are so what I'm showing

197
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,479
you here is a table that outlines the

198
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,039
home IOT devices per region sorted by

199
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,919
the fraction of homes in each region

200
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,240
that have an IOT device so at the helm

201
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,430
are regions like North

202
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,500
Western Europe and Oceania in the in the

203
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,270
largest case over two-thirds of American

204
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,030
North American homes contain at least

205
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,289
one IOT device North American homes also

206
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,090
have the highest number of median

207
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,969
devices per home with a median of seven

208
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,710
devices in a household now on the other

209
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,419
end our regions like South and Central

210
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,180
Asia and North Africa and the Middle

211
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,680
East in the smallest case only eight

212
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,539
point seven percent of the homes in

213
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,400
South Asia have at least one IOT device

214
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,620
and the median number of devices in

215
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,150
those homes is two which basically means

216
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,849
just the computer performing the scan

217
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,539
and the router and so off the bat you

218
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,310
know we're starting to see some

219
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,110
differences in the deployment of IOT

220
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,360
devices around the world the next

221
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,759
question we asked broadly was in you

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,639
know empirically based on this data set

223
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,320
what are these devices it's a dig into

224
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,300
this question what I want to start with

225
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,610
is taking a look at just a typical kind

226
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,960
of North American home so my biases

227
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,909
before starting this project was like

228
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,370
okay Americans you know we probably have

229
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,750
like Alexa is and maybe some toasters

230
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,789
and some lightbulbs and hair

231
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,319
straighteners but I was surprised to

232
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,000
find that the top devices in North

233
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,180
American homes are actually media

234
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,530
devices printers and game consoles these

235
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,909
are not things we typically think about

236
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,280
when we're talking about I have T

237
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:04,219
devices and in the largest case media

238
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,929
devices are found in 43 points or 43

239
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,759
percent of American homes and what are

240
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,130
these devices well they're like Smart

241
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,460
TVs and chromecast's and Apple TVs and

242
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,560
Amazon fire sticks in fact only in a

243
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,810
relatively number of small a relatively

244
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,340
small number of homes do we see Voice

245
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,900
assistance which show up say and 10

246
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,030
percent of homes and home automation

247
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,620
devices like nests and lightbulbs and

248
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,869
garage door openers which show up in

249
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,630
just in two percent of homes so how does

250
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,039
this how does this look you know

251
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,838
globally if you look at this device type

252
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,218
distributions worldwide you can actually

253
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,450
start to tease out you know some some

254
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,969
similarities and differences so for

255
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,500
example media devices are not just the

256
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,390
most popular device in North America

257
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,399
they are actually the most popular in

258
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,189
seven out of the 11 regions in our data

259
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,360
set and home automation devices and

260
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,040
voice assistance will actually they're

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
really only prevalent you know meaning

262
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,540
in more than one percent of homes in

263
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,760
North America Western Europe and Oceania

264
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,890
so you know what are all of the other

265
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,060
devices well you know it's kind of a

266
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,860
mixed bag depending on the region you

267
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,079
look like look at but for example in

268
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,020
South and Southeast Asia were notably

269
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,239
there are fewer home

270
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,910
with IOT devices surveillance devices

271
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,640
are very popular making up 54% of all

272
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,439
devices in South Asia and work

273
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,930
appliances are the most common device

274
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,820
type in East Asia and sub-saharan Africa

275
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,760
and they make up more than 50% of the

276
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,190
devices in sub-saharan Africa and you

277
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,720
know I can like go on documenting the

278
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,610
fine-grained differences between regions

279
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,260
and if you're into that you're more than

280
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,760
welcome to check out the paper but

281
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,709
broadly what we found is that each

282
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,959
region has unique device type

283
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,569
preferences and so the types of devices

284
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,040
that you find to be most popular vary

285
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,890
depending on the region you're looking

286
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,510
at and so now we know a IOT devices are

287
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,620
distribute any unevenly around the world

288
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,480
and that different regions have

289
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,760
different device type references the

290
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,490
next question we looked at was who is

291
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,350
making these devices so to answer this

292
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,700
we took a look at the vendors and the

293
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,100
manufacturers for devices around the

294
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,060
world globally we found that there were

295
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,730
about 13,500 unique manufacturers by

296
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,310
their I Triple E organizationally unique

297
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,529
identifier and in some regions had up to

298
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,729
10,000 different vendors so how do we

299
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,920
tackle this the first thing we

300
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,649
investigated was the fraction of total

301
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,839
devices that vendors cover per region so

302
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:18,540
what I'm showing you here is a CDF of

303
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,370
the vendors by how many devices they

304
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,099
cover where vendors are ranked by their

305
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,300
popularity in each region and what we

306
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,190
observed is that in spite of the fact

307
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,380
that each region has you know upwards of

308
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,660
thousands of vendors in every case just

309
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,370
a small fraction of them or act actually

310
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,130
make up the majority of the devices that

311
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,680
are popular in each region so in fact

312
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:41,610
for every region 90% of the IOT devices

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,319
are manufactured by just 100 vendors but

314
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,390
you know the flip side of this is that

315
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,700
of course there is a long tail of small

316
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,100
vendors that make up the other 10% of

317
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,450
devices and pointing and hinting at a

318
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,190
much more complex vendor ecosystem

319
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,010
however you know although this kind of

320
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,540
result holds an aggregate per region the

321
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,339
observation is not as neat if you take a

322
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,390
look at vendors by device type so so

323
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,430
what I'm showing you here is is the

324
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,350
exact same graph the exact same idea

325
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,349
except it's grouped by device types

326
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,790
rather than by region and what we see is

327
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,400
a split between different device types

328
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,589
so for example game consoles and voice

329
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
assistance are largely dominated by a

330
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,960
handful of end

331
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,329
there's just two vendors Google and

332
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,010
Amazon that make up more than 90% of the

333
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,380
voice assistance that we surveyed in

334
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,060
this study and in game consoles there

335
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,770
are three vendors Sony Nintendo and

336
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,020
Microsoft that make up more than 90% of

337
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,000
the market so there are certain device

338
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,160
types where we start we're seeing these

339
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,470
kinds of centralization in vendors

340
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,209
however you know conversely there are

341
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,160
other device types that are far more

342
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,839
heterogeneous so for example media

343
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,180
devices are the most heterogeneous

344
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,920
device type in our data set with the top

345
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,140
ten manufacturers only accounting for

346
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,120
60% of all devices and surveillance

347
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,650
devices are close second that's not to

348
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,300
say that there aren't obviously major

349
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,760
players and all of these device types

350
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,920
for example hikvision a Chinese company

351
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,540
that makes CCTVs accounts for eighteen

352
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,099
point four percent of all surveillance

353
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,260
cameras globally and has a strong

354
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,760
presence in almost every region but but

355
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,500
broadly we find that you know vendor

356
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,630
diversity really does also depend on

357
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,400
device type and for this for this the

358
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,100
reason for this is that some device

359
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,329
types for some device types you in

360
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,950
different regions actually tend to

361
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,589
prefer different vendors so for example

362
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,360
in Western Europe the most popular media

363
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:23,160
vendors are vendors like sage calm and

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,040
free who are French companies and

365
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,469
manufacture set-top boxes and DVRs but

366
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,300
in the u.s. our most popular media

367
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,370
vendors are Google and Amazon and Apple

368
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,890
and so ultimately what this is pointing

369
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,839
to is have a complex ecosystem with

370
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,600
thousands of actors and regional device

371
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040
differences and the last thing I want to

372
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,660
talk about then is okay well given this

373
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,870
complex ecosystem what does that

374
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,930
actually mean for IOT security security

375
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,640
is is is big and broad as we know and it

376
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,859
means many things it's hard to quantify

377
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,380
in a very heterogeneous system and so

378
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,360
what attackers are doing today our

379
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,130
simplest things they're looking for

380
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,040
devices with weak credentials and

381
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,560
vulnerabilities to known recent CVEs

382
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,599
and in this work we check for the

383
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,579
presence of weak credentials kind of as

384
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,770
a proxy for security so specifically

385
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,290
we're looking for the distribution of

386
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,870
weak credentials across FTP and telnet

387
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,300
- still popular services that are used

388
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,400
to administer IOT devices so you recall

389
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,109
that a vast Wi-Fi inspector tests for

390
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,029
this as part of the product and alerts

391
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,040
the user about weak credentials so you

392
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,810
know they can mitigate any issues the

393
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,160
way we test for these is by you know

394
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,279
using a list of common default

395
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,649
credential crude

396
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,810
pencils things like admin admin admin

397
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,180
those kinds of things so what do we find

398
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:40,388
well we found that 7.8 percent of

399
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,489
devices support FTP and 7.1 percent of

400
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,990
devices still support telnet and when we

401
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,089
took a little look at the devices that

402
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,350
supported FTP in general you know they

403
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,199
kind of made sense and these are largely

404
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,779
work appliances and make up about 78% of

405
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,209
all FTP devices and storage devices that

406
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,100
make up about 9% of of FTP devices you

407
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,290
know you could kind of ostensibly see

408
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,269
why such devices need FTP in order to

409
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,399
properly function

410
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:06,009
conversely 7.1 percent of devices still

411
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:11,529
support telnet and I don't I don't know

412
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:14,079
why now of these 17.4% exhibit of the

413
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,509
ftp devices exhibit weak FTP credentials

414
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,550
and 2.1 percent of the telnet devices

415
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,410
exhibit weak telnet credentials and if

416
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,479
you dig into the telnet devices a little

417
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,339
bit more you actually find that the

418
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,379
devices that support talent come mostly

419
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,930
from four categories surveillance

420
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:32,170
devices routers home appliances and

421
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,790
media devices of these surveillance

422
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,170
devices and routers have the weakest

423
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,209
observed security and in the most

424
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,439
egregious case ten point seven percent

425
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,258
of surveillance devices that support

426
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:42,849
telnet offer we credentials now that

427
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:44,019
back into the fact that country there

428
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,180
are countries that have lots of

429
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,680
surveillance devices and of course there

430
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,689
is a correlation between the percentage

431
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,430
of devices in your region that are

432
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,529
surveillance devices and the percentage

433
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,699
of weak telnet devices and kind of a

434
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,809
darker thing that this highlights is

435
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:57,729
that there are regions that are at a

436
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:59,829
disproportionate higher risk of security

437
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,930
just given the fact that they purchase

438
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:03,849
certain kinds of devices and of course

439
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,258
this is important because we exist in a

440
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,360
global Internet right if an attacker

441
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,220
gets a bot in South America they're

442
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,170
going to use it to attack services

443
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,089
globally and if you need a reminder of

444
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,219
this just think back to those initial

445
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,319
Mariah attacks from 2016 or the

446
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,290
infections and the scanners appeared

447
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:22,329
globally so broadly and although it's

448
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,309
one size of the puzzle here security

449
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,979
challenges vary per region depending on

450
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:28,660
device preferences indicating another

451
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,050
complication in a growing heterogeneous

452
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,809
IOT ecosystem okay so what do we learn

453
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,998
well the home IOT ecosystem is diverse

454
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,589
and it is fragmented and when you look

455
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,329
at this globally there are regional

456
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,679
devices at almost every level in terms

457
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,479
of the number of devices the device

458
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,600
types the vendors that they prefer

459
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,859
and this fragmented ecosystem you know

460
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,269
leads to kind of challenges in

461
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,009
quantifying security so there's not

462
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:52,629
gonna be one silver bullet and it's it's

463
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,429
challenging for us as a community to

464
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:56,410
figure out what exactly we need to focus

465
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,238
on in this study we looked at you know

466
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,519
the lowest common denominator weak

467
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:03,009
passwords but there is a lot unknown

468
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,109
still in order to measure the security

469
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,970
of these devices at scale and the last

470
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:08,529
thing I want to call out is that IOT you

471
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,079
know it's actually been here for years

472
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,790
and as we investigate new and fun

473
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,738
devices and we break them and cool in

474
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,259
fun ways let's not forget that there are

475
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:19,660
all of the other devices that exist and

476
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,910
that are still running telnet anyway

477
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,169
that is my time and the end of my talk

478
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:32,230
at this point I'm happy to take any

479
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:34,720
questions Thanks thank you back let me

480
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,329
start off with a kind of obvious

481
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,239
question which is do you have any sense

482
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:43,209
for what the demographics are the people

483
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:44,619
who run have asked Wi-Fi scanner and how

484
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,299
those differ from the overall

485
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:48,160
demographics it's a really good question

486
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:50,230
so I mean obviously you know these are

487
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,799
people that are running some kind of

488
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,419
security software so the guess is that

489
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,309
they are more security conscious they

490
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:59,139
may all this may inflate the number of

491
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,480
devices and the security posture of

492
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:04,240
those devices may actually be better so

493
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,309
there's one in our in our kind of our

494
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,299
intuition is that you know perhaps this

495
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:12,339
is actually a upper bound in terms of

496
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,799
the amount they're lower about in terms

497
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:20,589
of the number of security problems that

498
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:23,199
we see that ecosystem so thank you and I
