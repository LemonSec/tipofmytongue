1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,970
everybody my name's Alex it's an honor

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,480
and pleasure to be here Thank You dev

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:23,660
and thank you to everybody in the usenix

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,160
committee for letting me be here which I

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,649
know it was probably a pretty sketchy

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:32,210
thing for them so I do appreciate them

7
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:34,600
taking the risk on doing it I'm a little

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,570
nervous today right so this is not my

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,510
normal crowd I actually have been

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,589
looking forward to this talk very much

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,019
and I know you're wondering why you're

12
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:48,890
saying Alex I follow you on twitter

13
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:51,289
you're obviously a megalomaniac and

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,980
we'll take any kind of press in any

15
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,210
situation why would you not want to do a

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,858
talk like this well there's a couple

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,539
reasons right so that the first is that

18
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,750
last year this keynote speech was given

19
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:09,200
by a dr. James Mickens as dr. Mickens

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:14,170
here actually no of course why would he

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,460
come to a talk that I gave yeah so I

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,670
don't know how I could possibly live up

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,669
to the standard that this guy set giving

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:26,299
a talk a keynote after James Mickens is

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,750
kind of like somebody dating Alex Stamos

26
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,340
after being dumped by John Stamos really

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,719
my only move here is the same thing I

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,670
would do in this situation which is I

29
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,530
need to be supportive of the difficult

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,270
time all of you are going through with

31
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,789
the incredible letdown and expectations

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,759
from from what you're used to so I'll

33
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:46,880
just say I understand what you're going

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,750
through I'm sorry that you have to put

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,908
up with me he didn't dump you Mickens

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,560
didn't dump you because of you he has to

37
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,469
go through his own process this is about

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,030
him really and really Mickens hasn't

39
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,949
been anything famous since Full House so

40
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,859
let's kind of move on right let's let's

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,899
uh you know give me a chance the other

42
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,829
issue is you know I've realized while

43
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,210
I'm putting this talk together is I

44
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:10,340
haven't really had an original thought

45
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,320
in the last three years and now that I'm

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,600
in academia people care a lot about

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,970
plagiarism including a term that I

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,430
didn't know existed until recently

49
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,680
self-plagiarism and so I am little

50
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,659
worried about repeating myself and that

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,170
I'll have difficulty saying anything

52
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,910
that I haven't

53
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,410
before so I just want to put that up

54
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,579
front that a lot of things we talked

55
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,170
about today I have talked about before

56
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,420
but I thought I could pull them together

57
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,679
in a new way for this audience I know

58
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,869
this photo is freaking you out because

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,910
it's so incredibly realistic um this is

60
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,130
actually a new kind of deep fake this is

61
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,400
again that was trained off of my

62
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,780
seven-year-old using mspaint

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,380
so you'll be seeing that that paper

64
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,030
later and now that I'm in academia that

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,400
the standards for these kinds of talks

66
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,600
are very different right I

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,069
- not care that much about what you know

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,040
people holding me to an academic

69
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:03,190
standard but clearly now all of you are

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,350
my colleagues and I'm going to have to

71
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,959
live up to the expectations set by the

72
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,940
August institution that I'm part of as

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,500
you heard dev said my title when I

74
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,450
joined Stanford was adjunct professor

75
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,580
and as all of you know the term adjunct

76
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:21,018
is Latin for not really a and in fact

77
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,090
Stanford has gone rid of the entire

78
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,330
title now so I can't even call myself

79
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,980
that that's how bad I was when I came in

80
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,739
is that they eliminated an entire class

81
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,290
of position at the University thanks to

82
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,200
me taking it on in and that really you

83
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,060
know being part of the academic unwashed

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,399
not having a PhD having gone to a public

85
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,560
school really makes me a little bit

86
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,049
nervous about representing Stanford in

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,320
fact oh my god what is that a computer

88
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:51,230
enhance oh no is it true enhance again

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,820
oh yes it's famous computer scientist

90
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,130
John Hennessy and full academic regalia

91
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,120
looking down and judging me already for

92
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:01,000
this talk I feel I'm sorry John I'm

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
gonna try to do much better for you sir

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,450
so why am i doing this talk even though

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,488
I clearly don't want to do it well the

96
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,670
truth is is that we're not doing so hot

97
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:13,910
and for four we I mean a big collective

98
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,190
we of the general tech universe right

99
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,450
that means the the companies that that

100
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,089
build the products that are part of our

101
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,858
lives the the nerds who are part of

102
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,950
those companies in the academic

103
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:28,039
institutions that have spit them out so

104
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:31,310
successfully over the last 20 years this

105
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:32,840
is pretty clear in the way that the the

106
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,370
public is treating us I'm sure a lot of

107
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,020
people in here have seen Silicon Valley

108
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,470
the show right that there's an entire

109
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,049
show on HBO

110
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,880
that is making fun of tech now the

111
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,310
existence of the show in the beginning

112
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,110
was actually really interesting there

113
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,610
was an arresting statement on the power

114
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,250
that our industry now has in our society

115
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,320
and that HBO would would put millions

116
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,540
and millions of dollars in lampooning

117
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,060
all of these weird inside jokes of our

118
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,910
industry right so just like media just

119
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,810
like Hollywood just like politics we now

120
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,400
earned our own satirical HBO show but if

121
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,050
you've been watching Silicon Valley

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,450
since the beginning the tone has changed

123
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,240
a bit and for all of you young people in

124
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,620
the audience I hope that you too can

125
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,140
have a career where one day your

126
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,190
personal failings become a sight gag for

127
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,229
an HBO show but if you watch it you know

128
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,080
that the tone of how people are treating

129
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,990
us in the valley is becoming very very

130
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,890
different and very dark and that's

131
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,540
something that we have to take some

132
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,789
responsibility for and I think we got to

133
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,110
look at the big picture of why we've

134
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,900
gone here and the truth is is there

135
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,080
still some fundamental problems with how

136
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,510
we talk how we teach how we handle and

137
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,659
operationalize security in the world we

138
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,789
live in now we have inserted technology

139
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,180
into every aspect of people's lives

140
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,830
right that everything people do is now

141
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,900
been revolutionized over the last ten

142
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,570
years by information technology and yet

143
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,909
our understanding of the impacts that

144
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,810
have on people and how do we keep them

145
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,010
safe online has far from kept up and so

146
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,150
I thought I talked a little bit about

147
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,409
some of these fundamental problems in

148
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,440
some ways that I think we can now

149
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:17,010
together aggressive one of the first

150
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,440
ones is that we as both in academia and

151
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,750
in industry are still way too in love

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,719
with complexity as the thing that drives

153
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,790
our interest and what we work on in

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,100
security so here's a place where I am

155
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,600
directly ribbing myself off in that I'm

156
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,010
gonna use something that I talked about

157
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,020
a couple of years ago but nothing's

158
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,479
changed so why should I

159
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,190
it is my theory here and said they have

160
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,010
learned coming in academia is the way to

161
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:44,070
make yourself truly famous is to name a

162
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:46,800
law after yourself name a balancing test

163
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,930
Lane name some kind of theorem and so I

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,729
am trying to make this happen the

165
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,300
Stumbo's hierarchy of the actual bad

166
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,250
stuff that happened

167
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,319
on line two real people so I'd really

168
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,970
appreciate if you'd cite me on this in

169
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,819
your papers going forward and that you'd

170
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,080
use the entire non abbreviated title for

171
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,539
this idea that I'm talking about today

172
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,370
so imagine that this triangle represents

173
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:08,099
all of the bad things that happen to

174
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,099
people online it turns out the vast vast

175
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,050
majority of the human harm of the people

176
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,330
who are actually suffering in their

177
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,949
lives because of tech are suffering

178
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,979
because of what we term in the industry

179
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:22,319
abuse abuse is the technically correct

180
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:25,378
use of the products we build to cause

181
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,840
harm it generally has very little in the

182
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,759
way of a technical component of you know

183
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,289
it could be technical components and

184
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,389
trying to get around anti abuse systems

185
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:36,300
but for the most part the people who

186
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,250
abuse each other online are doing so by

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,069
using the products correctly but

188
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,259
harmfully the top of the triangle is

189
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,940
basically everything that all of us in

190
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,610
the room have dedicated our lives to are

191
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,259
up there right and this includes me and

192
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,449
in fact something I've learned over the

193
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,449
last couple of years is that I wasted a

194
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,919
lot of time thinking that complexity was

195
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,750
the interesting thing of all these

196
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,729
issues and so let's say even within the

197
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,860
InfoSec world let's zoom into that

198
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,990
triangle of the harm that causes the

199
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,770
people from traditional InfoSec of the

200
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,779
traditional subversion of systems to

201
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,389
break confidentiality integrity

202
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,630
availability if we zoom into that

203
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:17,969
triangle what you still see is a fractal

204
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,440
issue here and that the biggest issues

205
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:22,020
that actually cause harm to people in

206
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,029
the InfoSec world are quite simple right

207
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,349
the number one reason that people's

208
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,960
information is stolen online absolutely

209
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,120
number one with a bullet not even close

210
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,309
is the fact that people reuse passwords

211
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,640
everywhere those passwords get stolen

212
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,169
and then and then credential stuffed

213
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,990
into every site on the web there's

214
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,208
nothing at all close possibly from

215
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,099
statistically to the amount of

216
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,260
information that is stolen via that one

217
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,910
specific issue and this is especially

218
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,130
true if you look at the entire account

219
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,860
lifecycle of all the issues that come up

220
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,630
with people recovering their accounts of

221
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,360
of their emails being stolen of the fact

222
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,459
that still today if one account key

223
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,100
account is taken over that that creates

224
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,349
a huge effect on your entire life that

225
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,339
your entire digital life can all the

226
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,500
sudden Misa

227
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,970
that is still a huge issue when it comes

228
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,889
to machines actually being broken into

229
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,870
the vast majority of issues are really

230
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:17,910
just around patching right one of the

231
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,560
most important actual intrusions network

232
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,389
intrusions the last couple years was the

233
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,369
Equifax hack the Equifax hack was a

234
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,230
Apache struts bug that was not installed

235
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,089
because the company didn't have good

236
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,589
change controls did not have good risk

237
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,600
management did not understand where

238
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,300
their information was and had bad

239
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,190
patching processes there's nothing that

240
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,620
technically interesting about it just a

241
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,209
bad guy got lucky that there was

242
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,160
something very simple going on and were

243
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:46,229
able to exploit it simple configures so

244
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,269
there's an entire small industry of

245
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,550
people whose entire job it is to scan

246
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,860
Amazon s3 all day to find private

247
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,258
information and then to report it out

248
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,579
right the that kind of like simple the

249
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,319
cloud has actually been good for

250
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,880
security a lot of different ways but the

251
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:01,110
fact that it gives you all of these guns

252
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,089
that you can shoot at your own feet

253
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,069
means that a significant portion people

254
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,360
will shoot their toes off that is what's

255
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,880
happening a lot of cloud computing

256
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,000
environments old classic application

257
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,279
phones so if a piece of software is

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,589
actually exploit via a vulnerability

259
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,060
that is custom tailored for it is almost

260
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,250
certainly a class of vulnerability that

261
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,930
existed for years the capital one breach

262
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,880
one of the biggest interesting breaches

263
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,370
in the last couple of months is because

264
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,319
of an SS RF bug that allowed them to

265
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,240
access the AWS made metadata service

266
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:32,120
that is an issue that people have known

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,560
about for years and years and years

268
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,569
nothing really that interesting and then

269
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,069
you get at the top basically everything

270
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,740
we're talking about here at this

271
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:43,050
conference right and then at the top top

272
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,319
of that our actual O'Dea attacks right

273
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,779
so if you imagine the top pixel of this

274
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,969
are people using vulnerabilities or

275
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,980
exploits or classes of bugs that never

276
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,480
been seen before and let's say you could

277
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,630
have Superman vision and you could zoom

278
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,459
in to this screen to the top top pixel

279
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,800
what you would see is that that pixel is

280
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,719
actually an array of subpixels and this

281
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,550
sub pixel represents side-channel

282
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,180
attacks for the actual impact on

283
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,180
people's lives

284
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,160
now this doesn't mean that this research

285
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,470
isn't good I am glad people are doing

286
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,530
much more interesting esoteric attacks

287
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,270
where every 17 minutes they can sneak

288
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,180
one bit of data out of somebody else's

289
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,130
virtual machine on a shared processor I

290
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,260
think that's good I mean the truth is is

291
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,730
this triangle all of those issues

292
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,160
especially like in the old app and the

293
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,050
patching those kinds of issues come from

294
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,209
original research that ends up trickling

295
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,380
down to being useful kinds of flaws so

296
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,420
that doesn't mean we shouldn't do that

297
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,270
research but it does mean that we need

298
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,160
to think about the ratio of how much

299
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,120
time we are spending on this sub pixel

300
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,740
versus the 10 billion pixels that are in

301
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,420
the rest of the triangle and if you look

302
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,670
at the program of this conference or

303
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,319
basically any academic computer security

304
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,209
conference you will see the ratio is

305
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,890
probably not exactly where it

306
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,130
corresponds with the harm that is being

307
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:06,260
done to people another big interesting

308
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,080
issue that's going on in the industry

309
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,270
side is that we're dealing with the fact

310
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,730
that there is no good model for the

311
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,250
relationship between individuals in

312
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,830
democratic countries their governments

313
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,540
and the tech companies that have become

314
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,640
ineffective quasi governments now turns

315
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,459
out the entire history of Western

316
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,980
philosophy in political science is about

317
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,080
fighting over this issue right about the

318
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,670
idea of the self about what kind of

319
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,470
self-determination an individual has

320
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,560
what responsibilities they have to

321
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,720
society and what kind of controls do you

322
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,760
place on governments and a colleague of

323
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,830
mine at Stanford Daphne Keller at

324
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,650
Stanford Law School likes to talk about

325
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,990
how the Internet has kind of overturned

326
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,699
all of these fights that we have had for

327
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,060
hundreds and hundreds of years and the

328
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,480
consensus that we ended up with it in in

329
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,920
a number of advanced democracies she

330
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,290
likes to use the term that there's a

331
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,780
irrational exuberance for speech control

332
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,300
now partially because the Internet has

333
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,069
really changed the kind of fundamentals

334
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,920
of the arguments we have been making

335
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,990
fruit for years and years the way I like

336
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,819
to talk about this is to bring it in to

337
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,830
engineers is to talk about this issue as

338
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,080
an optimization problem and everybody

339
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,610
here knows like the classic engineering

340
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,770
optimization optimization problem right

341
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,430
you can have something done fast

342
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,430
correct

343
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,290
or cheap pick two of these three things

344
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,109
right optimization problem you pick a

345
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,790
point within this this triangle and

346
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,800
that's your decision of how you want to

347
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,140
balance these equities well it turns out

348
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,880
when you're talking about platforms that

349
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,439
have billions of people that control of

350
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,870
their speech the responsibility to keep

351
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,690
people safe and this is a much more

352
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,540
complicated polygon right and the

353
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,660
equities are all important but they're

354
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,560
also all opposing so it

355
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,990
unfortunately the optimization problem

356
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,479
here is not only difficult but it's

357
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,070
poorly understood so in that triangle

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,460
it's pretty easy to understand that the

359
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,770
fast cheap correct but in the situation

360
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,420
where you're running a multi billion

361
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,210
person communication platform for

362
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,430
example the decisions you make if you

363
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,140
move towards any of these equities often

364
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,150
can mean you move away from other

365
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,130
equities in a nonlinear and

366
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,569
unpredictable fashion and this is the

367
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,830
fundamental challenge of some of the

368
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,010
geopolitical issues that we're dealing

369
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,690
with right now is that this chart is not

370
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,010
understood by anybody it's certainly not

371
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,500
understood by the media and the

372
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,610
politicians who like to criticize us but

373
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,560
it's not even understood by the people

374
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,810
in the room and there hasn't been enough

375
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,880
discussion about the fact that we're

376
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,890
going to have to make hard choices on

377
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,910
this there's a little bit of a crack in

378
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,040
the wall or people are starting to get

379
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,480
this The Wall Street Journal last week I

380
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,390
believe had the interesting article

381
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,430
about how Facebook is now under an FTC

382
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,550
consent decree that obligates Facebook

383
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,349
to stop people from scraping public data

384
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,540
right so there's this big interesting

385
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,210
argument of if I can publicly go to a

386
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,250
web site and see something is it worse

387
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,560
if that data is all collected into one

388
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,110
place and then again leaked via an s3

389
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,339
bucket right and effectively the FTC is

390
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,920
saying that's a horrible thing it's a

391
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,080
horrible thing if people can collect

392
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,420
data that is otherwise available from an

393
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,310
individual perspective into one place

394
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,219
and that that information might leak at

395
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,199
the same time the FBI is hiring

396
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,030
companies to scrape facebook so they can

397
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,280
go look for white supremacists right and

398
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,530
so this is the exact problem and that

399
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,209
our government is both saying to

400
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,250
companies you have an absolute

401
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,740
responsibility to stop the FBI from

402
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,060
doing their job and this is the sign of

403
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,220
a very dysfunctional political

404
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,099
discussion about what do we want as

405
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,990
and a big chunk of this is due to the

406
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,360
fact that the tech companies have not

407
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,940
been proactively honest about what's

408
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,430
going on the fundamental truth is that

409
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,350
every major tech company has a huge

410
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,109
number of people who working very very

411
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,450
hard right now to make the internet as

412
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,149
bad as it is right now so as bad as the

413
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,450
internet is as much harm has happened as

414
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,620
big as that triangle is it would be

415
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,990
significantly bigger if there were

416
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,029
thousands of people working in trust and

417
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,740
safety and investigations and law

418
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,660
enforcement Response Teams and the other

419
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,100
kind teams that find and stop bad guys

420
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,209
and perhaps every once in a while get

421
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,550
them arrested

422
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,018
the scale of this problem is actually

423
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,359
difficult to discuss because the

424
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,430
companies don't release numbers about

425
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,140
most kinds of abuse one of the only

426
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,540
situations where we have good numbers a

427
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,250
class of abuse is around the sexual

428
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,480
exploitation of children and that's

429
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,100
because there is an organization

430
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,540
chartered by Congress called the

431
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,600
National Center of missing Exploited

432
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,959
Children that is allowed and in fact

433
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,120
required to gather up reports of bad

434
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,189
things that happen to children line and

435
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
to gather up all that information to

436
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,940
coordinate between the companies and to

437
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,500
report statistics out and last year

438
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,680
what's called the cyber tipline which is

439
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,630
effectively an API that allows tech

440
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,260
companies to report bad things happening

441
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:58,550
to kids got 18 point four million tips

442
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,980
in one year in the United States alone

443
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,779
eighteen point four million that's a big

444
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,720
number right for a country of three

445
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,550
hundred and forty million people right

446
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,220
that is a horrible number and each one

447
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,339
of these stories is actually pretty

448
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,550
horrible in fact as we meet right now as

449
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,319
we sit in this room there are a thousand

450
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,780
people or sorry I think it's like three

451
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,418
or four thousand people at the worst

452
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,678
hotel in Dallas Texas at a conference

453
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,590
called the crimes against children

454
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,970
conference and these companies these are

455
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,770
the tech companies are all represented

456
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,070
there they're running a whole tract of

457
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,809
discussion and these are the the

458
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,030
sessions that are happening right now so

459
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:42,059
this is from today's schedule while we

460
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,879
stand here yeah as of right now these

461
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,100
sessions are still going on this is the

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,270
reality of the world we live in right is

463
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,649
that we

464
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,420
in a world where a talk called pediatric

465
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,850
strangulation a multidisciplinary

466
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,870
response has to be repeated because it's

467
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,010
so incredibly popular right this is

468
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,260
something that the companies don't want

469
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,300
to talk about is the fact that the world

470
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,610
is a dark place and that there's a

471
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,590
significant percentage of people who

472
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,939
want to harm other people that has

473
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,290
existed forever right

474
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,150
that has been true forever but the

475
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,690
Internet allows them to do that in new

476
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,280
ways

477
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,320
it allows them to do it from thousands

478
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,879
of miles away and sometimes it allows it

479
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,220
to do it if they have decent technical

480
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
skills in a way that is effectively

481
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,480
impossible for law enforcement to catch

482
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,190
them um and the fact that the companies

483
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,960
don't proactively talk about this is

484
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:34,500
part of the reason why we have the

485
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,210
problem with my big star is that because

486
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,520
we don't talk about the trade-offs it is

487
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,290
impossible for policymakers to make

488
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,480
intelligent decisions so you don't see

489
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,520
this issue with other industries right

490
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,990
the oil and gas industry makes it very

491
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,970
clear if you make it hard for them to

492
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,340
pull gas out of the ground gas prices

493
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,110
will go up right you can there's there's

494
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,760
arguments to make gas prices go up a lot

495
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,889
of good arguments I think but at least

496
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
the trade-offs are understood but in the

497
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,730
tech industry because we want to present

498
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,699
this future that everything's bright and

499
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,860
cheery and happy all the time we don't

500
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,580
engage the world with how it really is

501
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,020
and the truth is is academia is not

502
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,970
engaging the world with how it is and

503
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,600
that's one of the things I'll talk about

504
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,580
in a second another big issue is we are

505
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,179
collectively not learning from our

506
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,699
mistakes

507
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,810
so as dev said I spent a little bit of

508
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,260
time as the chief information security

509
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:29,610
officer of Yahoo and shortly after I

510
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,530
joined Yahoo in 2014 we dealt with an

511
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,570
intrusion by this institution anybody

512
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,570
know whose institution the seal is for

513
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,230
its Russia but like anybody want to get

514
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,090
more specific there's gotta be some

515
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,400
Russian speakers here

516
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,409
FSB yes so this is for the FSB the

517
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,270
Internal Security Bureau there's three

518
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,700
main intelligence agencies in Russia the

519
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,610
FSB and SVR are the descendants of the

520
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,760
KGB FSB is is focused on domestic issues

521
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,129
as well as the former Soviet states SVRs

522
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,050
is spying overseas the other totally

523
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,770
different one is GRU which is military

524
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,450
intelligence

525
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,580
gru was the one that was mostly involved

526
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,500
in the u.s. election FSB there's a lot

527
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,720
of oil and gas stuff right so FSB is

528
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,340
interested in breaking into American

529
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,880
companies that have access to data

530
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:18,090
either on Russians who are dissidents or

531
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,210
journalists or on stealing data about

532
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,709
the oil and gas industry the FSB was

533
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,750
very interested in data that was being

534
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:29,490
held by Yahoo and so they put a team on

535
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,320
it and this team is actually you would

536
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,880
think that these guys are like uniformed

537
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,470
military members sitting in the closet

538
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,090
but actually not right this team is

539
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,280
actually run by this guy Alexei baylon

540
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,379
I'm Alexi is not Russian he's Latvian

541
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,649
and the story that I was told by an FBI

542
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,990
agent was that Alexi actually used to

543
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,150
hack into a lot of Russian companies the

544
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:53,220
FSB caught him and they said so my

545
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:55,410
friend you can work for us doing hacking

546
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,820
on our behalf or you can live out the

547
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,510
rest of your short life in this little

548
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,490
concrete box and he chose option a out

549
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:05,309
of those two options and chose to work

550
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,590
on behalf of the FSB and so Alexi runs a

551
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,300
hacking team that both hacks on for

552
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,909
financial benefit of himself in his

553
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,940
people but then also does work for his

554
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:18,210
uncles at the FSB and this was a

555
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,860
multi-month intrusion it was a very

556
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,030
difficult one for us to root out and

557
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,189
I'll talk about some of the root causes

558
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,870
of why but this is something an

559
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,050
intrusion that we fought for many many

560
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,750
months at Yahoo eventually reasonably

561
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,000
successfully but at the by the end of

562
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,070
that they had able to abscond swith some

563
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,020
database backups of the user database

564
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,720
and within those user databases were a

565
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:43,050
bunch of different be cryptic encrypted

566
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,660
hashes now those hashes while probably

567
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,980
hard to crack an amass certainly could

568
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,440
be cracked on an individual basis and

569
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,610
that puts individual people at risk for

570
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,240
their information at Yahoo being

571
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,770
accessed by the Russian government one

572
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
of the outcomes for me personally of

573
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,990
dealing with this is that I have now

574
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,110
been questioned five times under oath or

575
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,990
under penalty of perjury about this

576
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,850
incident three times in civil lawsuits

577
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,130
that were filed against Yahoo and

578
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:14,129
Verizon the company that bought it twice

579
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,530
by a combination of the FBI the SEC and

580
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,170
the FT

581
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,149
see this is not an experience I can

582
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,280
suggest or recommend to the young people

583
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,490
in the audience but it is quite possibly

584
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,139
if you end up being in a position of any

585
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,000
kind of influence within industry it is

586
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,230
likely a situation you will have to deal

587
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,330
with I'm looking at Eric grosse from

588
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,090
Google right now because I know he is he

589
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,149
has been at that table to depositions

590
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:39,100
are a very interesting thing in the

591
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,160
deposition you have been compelled to

592
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,480
answer questions you don't get to claim

593
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,220
the Fifth Amendment right you don't get

594
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,620
to take the fifth the Fifth Amendment

595
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,980
only applies to your own personal

596
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,120
criminal liability so you can't say that

597
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,010
you're not going to answer questions you

598
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,810
were required to sit there and there's

599
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,240
lawyers from in this case the the

600
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,610
class-action plaintiffs who are asking

601
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,560
questions there's a court reporter who's

602
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,080
writing stuff very rapidly

603
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,669
there's a video camera on you and then

604
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,020
there's a whole table of lawyers

605
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,430
representing all of the different

606
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,170
interests right so I have my lawyers

607
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,930
I've got lawyers from Yahoo lawyers from

608
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,510
Verizon effectively collectively the

609
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,070
room was probably billing around $10,000

610
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,500
an hour and I was the only one not

611
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,200
getting paid to be there which is a lot

612
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,720
of fun I probably spent through those

613
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,130
five interviews 30 to 35 hours in those

614
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,020
interviews and you know about probably

615
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,700
100 120 hours preparing for those

616
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,590
interviews that's fine this is my

617
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,670
responsibility I had a position of

618
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,189
responsibility it is my responsibility

619
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,950
to tell the truth about what I observed

620
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,900
and what happened those lawsuits and

621
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,940
those investigators interviewed dozens

622
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,190
and dozens of people so collectively

623
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,530
they did thousands and thousands of

624
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,880
hours of interviews and thousands of

625
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,600
hours of investigation of what happened

626
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,250
at Yahoo I'll tell you a quick story

627
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,469
about a fun little tip you got to be

628
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,600
very careful about what you put in email

629
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,700
let me just tell you young people

630
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,030
because the way this whole thing starts

631
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,590
is they send a request to the company to

632
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,450
give them all the email with certain

633
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,740
keywords in it and then they look

634
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,630
through all those emails and then they

635
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,910
give you this huge binder and they make

636
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,470
you go through the binder and read to

637
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,630
them on camera with the stenographer

638
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,240
typing and they make you read these

639
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,500
emails out and then explain what you are

640
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,820
thinking at the time which can actually

641
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,590
be quite difficult to go back years and

642
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,760
years and to put yourself back into

643
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,810
place

644
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,850
one email that stands out very

645
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,710
particularly for me that I got

646
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,719
questioned about it's because you know

647
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,120
like I said this was a multi-month issue

648
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,370
for us to deal with the FSB during those

649
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,350
months I actually broke my knee I

650
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,149
fractured my kneecap I tore up a bunch

651
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,649
of stuff my knee I've had three knee

652
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,780
surgeries the two I had in high school

653
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,210
were due to a soccer injury in Taekwondo

654
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,710
this last the injury was because I fell

655
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,100
off a ladder putting up my Christmas

656
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,710
lights so that's what aging is kids is

657
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,570
that you go from soccer injuries to your

658
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,160
wife looking down at you on the ground

659
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,030
saying why the hell did you get up on

660
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,690
the ladder to put up the Christmas

661
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:07,930
lights now your knee is broken and so I

662
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,070
was crunching around for most of the

663
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,070
incident response that we're dealing

664
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,300
with delaying my surgery because we were

665
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,250
in the middle of an incident right and I

666
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,930
couldn't take a week off we finally

667
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,640
kicked these guys off the network and so

668
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,640
I go in to fix my knee before I'm

669
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,380
permanently lame and my surgeons like I

670
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,910
can't believe you're delaying I I don't

671
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,750
know what FSB stands for but I can tell

672
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,550
you is you're not gonna be able to walk

673
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,020
again unless you get this thing fixed

674
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,090
so I finally go in I'm in the surgery

675
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm sitting in the hospital I've got an

676
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,919
IV in my arm they've put something in it

677
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,440
and my phone vibrates and I open up the

678
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,570
phone and there's an email and it's an

679
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,090
email from a consultant from McKinsey &

680
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,429
Co who had been hired by Yahoo to figure

681
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,590
out people at the company who were not

682
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,830
critical and could possibly be laid off

683
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:53,199
to increase Yahoo's bottom line so this

684
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,840
is a spreadsheet of some of my best

685
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,360
people in the middle of we have just

686
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,860
finished into the response against the

687
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:06,370
the FSB and and they've got this list of

688
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:09,159
people who are non-critical so I've got

689
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,199
like literally 45 minutes before I'm

690
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,340
about to go into surgery I feel like

691
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,930
it's important for me to take care of

692
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,189
this I end up for it him to my boss my

693
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,130
boss was actually quite a nice man

694
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,680
effectively the CTO of the company and

695
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,900
and so now the experience is that I'm

696
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,030
sitting years later at a deposition

697
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,410
table and there's these lawyers across

698
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,030
from me and there's a video camera and

699
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:31,080
there's somebody typing and they asked

700
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,910
me mister stavos please turn to tab 46

701
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,490
yeah yes we'd like you to read this

702
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,530
email out loud to us and so I sit there

703
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,400
and I have to read this email and in

704
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:46,720
this the experiences is me going

705
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:49,059
J why the eff am I looking at AF in

706
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,370
spreadsheet from an effing McKinsey

707
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:55,450
consultant who doesn't know anything

708
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:58,870
about effing layoffs in the middle of a

709
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,400
GD incident response it goes on like

710
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,739
this now I'm actually saying the words

711
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,679
and after every sentence the lawyer

712
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,790
stopped me and they say some sir samos

713
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,240
why did you say that what were you

714
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,920
feeling at the time I'm saying well in

715
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,440
this first paragraph I'm explaining to

716
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,179
mr. Rossiter my concern for the

717
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,090
allocation of resources within Yahoo

718
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,790
Incorporated so anyway that's what a

719
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:24,129
deposition is like is every little email

720
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,690
you write every text message gets thrown

721
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,760
up against you but this is a good

722
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,440
process right actually yahoo made

723
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,890
mistakes I made mistakes the company

724
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,380
failed this is good as a society we

725
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,000
should spend thousands of hours figuring

726
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,370
out what happened and learning from it

727
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,470
and what was the output of thousands of

728
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,299
person hours of interviews of

729
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,120
investigation of review of email of all

730
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:49,240
this the entire output was that these

731
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,439
lawyers asked for 35 million bucks 50

732
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,540
million dollars for all the possible

733
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,370
people who were affected which is much

734
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,190
less than $1 per person it's about 25

735
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:01,809
cents per person per potential plaintiff

736
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:03,190
and nothing else as a society nothing

737
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,790
else that came out of this whole process

738
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:09,100
ever became public the story I just told

739
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,260
you is the only email you will hear of

740
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,969
from the thousands of emails that lay

741
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,040
out all of the fundamental issues that

742
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,620
happened at Yahoo that led to that

743
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,570
breach and it's because our society

744
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:25,360
isn't set up to fix these things our

745
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:28,659
society is set up to divvy out blame to

746
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,750
divvy out blame and to make lawyers rich

747
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,000
right we're not set up to actually make

748
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,860
anything better and that's a real

749
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
fundamental problem other industries

750
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,909
don't have this problem right and this

751
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,470
is why we end up with the same bugs over

752
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,630
and over again the last couple of years

753
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,710
we keep on having these bugs where

754
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,299
people are storing passwords in plain

755
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,500
text this isn't because these people are

756
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,480
stupid and think it's okay to store

757
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,370
passwords in plain text it's because in

758
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,230
a big distributed system it's extremely

759
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,560
likely at some point that one of your

760
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,330
engineers will be debugging

761
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,610
and they'll turn on full parameter

762
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,679
logging and they'll log passwords and

763
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,000
not know it right all three of these

764
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,740
major companies you know Microsoft

765
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,140
Twitter Facebook had the exact same

766
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,650
problem in none of these situations was

767
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,310
any kind of major you know every single

768
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,470
one of these companies

769
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,000
I guarantee did a massive internal deep

770
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,580
dive into the root causes the problem

771
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,050
they analysed exactly went wrong and

772
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,669
they figured out how they're gonna fix

773
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,190
it none of that is public and so as a

774
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,600
result for the next ten years every six

775
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,820
months you are going to see this exact

776
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,830
same headline right because as a society

777
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,659
we're not learning other industries to

778
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,520
figure this out right I know people are

779
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,630
like oh securities really hard well you

780
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,120
know what else is really hard

781
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,130
he's like hurtling millions of people

782
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,270
per day through the air at almost the

783
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,680
speed of sound and getting them to

784
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,180
places safely right that's what the

785
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,280
airline industry does every single day

786
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,380
and one of the reasons you know if if

787
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,510
they were as good at security and safety

788
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,880
as we are half of you wouldn't be here

789
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,129
because you would all be dead trying to

790
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,470
fly to Santa Clara right and the reason

791
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:57,440
why they're so good safety is because

792
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,450
they look inward every time there is a

793
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,920
problem they do deep deep dives into it

794
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,270
and so if there's a major incident if

795
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,000
there's an incident it has like a whole

796
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:08,870
loss or some kind of casualty at all

797
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,360
then there's a national group the NTSB

798
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,010
that does a deep investigation in these

799
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,810
cases if you look you can't really see

800
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,580
the details but takes in some cases a

801
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,440
year to do an investigation in some of

802
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,659
these cases and then they write a multi

803
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,940
hundred page report that everybody can

804
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,700
read and everybody in the industry can

805
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,590
learn from almost this amount of work

806
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,480
probably happened in the yahoo breach

807
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,879
but this outcome didn't happen because

808
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,590
the benefit is that some scum-sucking

809
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,380
class action lawyer gets to buy another

810
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,120
boat in Miami right it's not that here's

811
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,580
500 pages that everybody can learn from

812
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,719
and even for close calls in aviation

813
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,429
they're able to deal with this so in

814
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,750
situations where they're a bad thing

815
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,880
didn't actually happen but something

816
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,710
almost happened there's an entire system

817
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,980
by which people who are part of aviation

818
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,390
are supposed to go report it themselves

819
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,910
they get legal protection right so they

820
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,290
can't be they can't be prosecuted or

821
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,480
punished for the information that they

822
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,000
give over and they are highly motivated

823
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,320
to go into self-report and this makes

824
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,550
the entire system better this is

825
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,020
actually kind of a terrifying you can

826
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,090
this is the public you can go to the

827
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,418
ASRs you can go to this database and

828
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,109
this

829
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:15,409
a real incident from SFO recently that

830
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:18,918
talks about a 787 having a significant

831
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:21,159
issue on landing but the reason why this

832
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,570
didn't end up with anybody dying and

833
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,519
99.99999% of the time these issues don't

834
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,080
end up with any deaths is because of

835
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,249
this kind of self-reflection which is

836
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,960
something we don't have in something we

837
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:31,429
don't have an industry but it's the

838
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,720
bigger problem is we don't have a legal

839
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:35,509
system that makes this something that

840
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,730
people want to do and the truth is is

841
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:39,980
that you only hear about 10% of the

842
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,720
breaches maybe 5% that happened because

843
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,450
the only situations which people are

844
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,070
required to talk about a breach is when

845
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,409
personal information has been exposed

846
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,570
the vast majority of information you are

847
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:53,239
not that interesting the Chinese don't

848
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:56,389
actually care about your data right the

849
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:59,269
the real qualified high skilled

850
00:31:56,389 --> 00:32:01,219
adversaries want information for

851
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:03,320
industrial espionage they want long-term

852
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,820
intellectual property they want to know

853
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,489
about what is going on from an

854
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,009
intelligence perspective so the only the

855
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:11,869
small portion of the verb of the

856
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:14,090
breaches are the things that we discuss

857
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:15,980
and so as a result we're not learning it

858
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,709
all from those incidents and we're not

859
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,480
getting better at these things so I'll

860
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,820
give you my lessons like if there was an

861
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,159
NTSB report these are things that I

862
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,809
think would come out of Yahoo versus the

863
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,509
FSB just some quick lessons for you guys

864
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:31,428
to take into your jobs the first is that

865
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:34,009
when you're talking about at scale

866
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:35,119
technology if just like a shark if

867
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:37,279
you're not moving forward you're

868
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,289
drowning one of the challenges at Yahoo

869
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,570
is that Yahoo had to effectively invent

870
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:43,279
web-scale computing in the late 90s all

871
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,019
by themselves right before David Philo

872
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,119
took on this problem nobody had ever

873
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:48,379
handled a million concurrent users like

874
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,408
you can do that off of an Android phone

875
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:53,059
now but like at the time you know

876
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:56,059
handling millions of concurrent users

877
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,739
into a dynamic web app was something

878
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,158
nobody had ever done and so Yahoo had to

879
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:02,869
invent all these technologies all these

880
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,419
key-value non-si no sequel databases

881
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:07,369
you know Yahoo invented Hadoop right so

882
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,619
Yahoo invented a whole set of

883
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:11,689
technologies around data warehouses but

884
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:14,418
as a result when you look at Yahoo's

885
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,609
Network things that any other company

886
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,169
would do just by pulling Redis and

887
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:19,999
MongoDB and hive and a bunch of other

888
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:22,160
stuff off of github and then putting

889
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,720
these well-understood components

890
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,840
are patched and are part of a community

891
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,050
together Yahoo built themselves so Yahoo

892
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,669
was at the time I joined effectively

893
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:34,399
almost all of it was custom code that

894
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,200
was built at Yahoo for Yahoo and

895
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,270
unfortunately the company had spent

896
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,760
decades not investing that technology of

897
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,710
effectively hiring engineers to reverse

898
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,900
engineer what the people had done before

899
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,700
them so they could pray to these secret

900
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,980
systems like the user database was not

901
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,930
based upon some well-known no sequel

902
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,280
database it was it's this code that had

903
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,810
built a god because at the time yahoo

904
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,160
did it nobody built a database that was

905
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,129
a distributed no sequel database right

906
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,560
like they didn't even exist and so as a

907
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:03,140
result that made it incredibly hard to

908
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,510
do security because all of the time

909
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,880
95% of your attack surface is all custom

910
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,770
code right whereas a vast majority hack

911
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,150
service for most most companies are well

912
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:15,469
understood pieces of technology that you

913
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:17,450
can secure the second is that a tech

914
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,459
giant being responsive to Wall Street is

915
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:21,889
actually a really bad thing

916
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,290
while I was at Yahoo we picked up a

917
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,179
thing called an activist investor the

918
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,040
this person's claim to fame was that

919
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,960
they had turned around the Olive Garden

920
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,418
I'm not kidding that had been like these

921
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,668
investors had taken over the board of

922
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,440
the Olive Garden cut the number of

923
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:38,480
breadsticks you've got and made it a

924
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,620
profitable business and so that made

925
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,780
them believe that they knew what was

926
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,310
best for a platform that was serving

927
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,800
hundreds of millions of people and

928
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:48,620
holding sensitive data on hundreds of

929
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,300
millions of inboxes as a result of this

930
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,819
activist investor Yahoo became very very

931
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,290
focused on the bottom line and on making

932
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,270
decisions that would make the numbers

933
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,640
look good every single quarter to keep

934
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,740
Wall Street happy up that is a very

935
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,480
dangerous way for companies to think

936
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,189
there's a lot of discussion now about

937
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,230
whether founders of companies should

938
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,480
have overriding voting control and I

939
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:12,560
actually say yes because the only thing

940
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,720
worse than a megalomaniacal founder

941
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,480
controlling the company is Wall Street

942
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,490
controlling the company right in fact I

943
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,630
think tech is too responsive to Wall

944
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,100
Street I think one of the fundamental

945
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,440
problems we have in the tech industry is

946
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,330
that at all the big public companies the

947
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,890
executives are mostly paid based upon

948
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,870
what Wall Street thinks of them around

949
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:32,540
80 some percent of my compensation at

950
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:35,060
Facebook was was pegged to the stock

951
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,540
price and so as a result we end up being

952
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,820
too

953
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,200
responsive to the financial concerns and

954
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,820
not responsive enough to the long-term

955
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,160
thoughts about what's important for

956
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,810
people and the third this is more of a

957
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,089
personal thing if you have an IV in your

958
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:51,770
arm turn your phone off that just turns

959
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,910
out to have like meds for pre surgery is

960
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,190
not something that you want to recount

961
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:59,000
at a deposition or to an FBI agent it

962
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:01,610
turns out so back to like kind of the

963
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,280
big picture issues another fundamental

964
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,630
issue we have in the valley is that

965
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,330
people are trying to scale the culture

966
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,240
like a big deal at a lot of companies is

967
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,950
that they believe that the core culture

968
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,390
that got them there is still the thing

969
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,310
that is important for them as they

970
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,470
become companies at tens of thousands or

971
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,570
hundreds of thousands of employees but

972
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,950
unfortunately while they do that scale

973
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,440
and the culture they end up worshiping

974
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,629
the past a little too much there's a

975
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,940
great blog that I recommend you guys all

976
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,040
read called strata quarry again in Ben

977
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,750
Thompson he also has a podcast and he

978
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,810
had this great post several years ago

979
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,730
about the curse of culture right he

980
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,549
basically says and he's quoting a number

981
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,470
of business philosophers here that

982
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,780
culture is the thing that allows

983
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,330
companies to operate right a corporate

984
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,310
culture means the CEO doesn't have to go

985
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,630
around and tell every person these are

986
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,880
the decisions I want you to make today

987
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,840
the culture and forms of decisions right

988
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,580
if you have a strong corporate culture

989
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,010
everybody kind of knows what they're

990
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,360
supposed to be doing and therefore the

991
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,700
company works in a much more efficient

992
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,800
way but there is also a real problem

993
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,230
here and that as companies are

994
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,000
successful by definition they look back

995
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,790
at their culture and they say the

996
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,800
culture is why we succeeded and they

997
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,080
don't differentiate between the things

998
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,090
that actually caused their success and

999
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,860
perhaps the side effects or the

1000
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,960
irrelevant parts of their culture that

1001
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,850
now need to be discarded and so they end

1002
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,320
up becoming rigid and the way that

1003
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,080
expresses itself at Silicon Valley is

1004
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,450
you end up with veneration of engineers

1005
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,069
who have been there a long time you have

1006
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,020
these people who talk about man this

1007
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,760
company was so much better we were in

1008
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,850
that little office and there's 500 of us

1009
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,680
and everything was great then and that's

1010
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,540
fine to talk about the past being better

1011
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,069
it's a little dismissive of the

1012
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,770
thousands of people that you've hired

1013
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,990
who are now making you rich by you

1014
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,130
alienating their labor to be a bit of a

1015
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,200
Marxist

1016
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,430
but you know okay if you want to be a

1017
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,049
jerk like that that's fine

1018
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,580
but where it gets really dangerous is

1019
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,530
where the veneration the past because of

1020
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,660
veneration of the decisions made in the

1021
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,100
past so at Facebook this was a real

1022
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,569
problem it was a real problem because

1023
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,270
the veneration of decisions that were

1024
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,310
made back in a time when Facebook was

1025
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:10,850
effectively the life support system for

1026
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,590
farmville were not relevant for when

1027
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,470
Facebook became the world's most

1028
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,270
important political discussion machine

1029
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:19,040
right when Facebook ended up carrying

1030
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,080
more discussion about politics than any

1031
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,810
other media really in the history of the

1032
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,940
world in fact I would argue that today

1033
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:30,140
Facebook and Google together have a a

1034
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,820
stronger stranglehold on on the flow of

1035
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,040
information worldwide than any

1036
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,510
organization has had since probably the

1037
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,130
Roman Catholic Church pre-reformation

1038
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,440
before the invention of the printing

1039
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:42,020
press when the Catholic Church

1040
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,940
controlled what was history in Europe

1041
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,190
through the youth the fact that books

1042
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,690
had to be copied manually and that our

1043
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,340
entire view of the ancient worlds

1044
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,110
actually filtered through decisions that

1045
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,790
were made by individual monks like in

1046
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,230
the 1400s of what they're gonna keep in

1047
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,460
what they're not right the invention of

1048
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,220
the printing press was an incredibly

1049
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,170
democratizing step for information and

1050
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,700
in many ways Google and Facebook and

1051
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,680
other companies have been democratizing

1052
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,210
that people have voices but you had up

1053
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,339
at this massive centralization of who

1054
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,140
controls those printing presses now and

1055
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,040
that's an incredibly big responsibility

1056
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,140
and it's a response with that

1057
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,779
responsibility comes a responsibility to

1058
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,250
rethink the decisions of the past and I

1059
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,290
think that's a problem that lots of tech

1060
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,600
giant's have is that they believe that

1061
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,120
the decision that they made in 2008 that

1062
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,830
led to them all becoming millionaires

1063
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,180
where there are the right things now and

1064
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,770
the truth is is that when the facts

1065
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,169
changed the decisions have to change as

1066
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,370
well and that's a real corporate culture

1067
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,500
issue that we're dealing with in the

1068
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,790
valley that's hard to fix it's funny

1069
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,530
because you wouldn't here in Silicon

1070
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,670
Valley people are too conservative or

1071
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,410
interested in the past we talk about

1072
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,910
disruption in such all the time but

1073
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,109
that's not actually true at these

1074
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,390
companies and I think that's a

1075
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,590
fundamental problem another article I

1076
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,330
think you should read actually just came

1077
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,300
out yesterday it's about some of the

1078
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:53,380
same issues at Google I think this part

1079
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,280
is really interesting is the idea that

1080
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,430
supporting and protecting diva's

1081
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,990
difficult or brilliant employees is is a

1082
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,609
good thing that is something that scales

1083
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:05,129
and I think that's actually the

1084
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,410
no company is more influential on modern

1085
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,180
Silicon Valley corporate culture than

1086
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,259
Google and this is one of the things at

1087
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,460
Google it's given the rest of us I

1088
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,640
think's bad right

1089
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,320
I think actually the supporting of

1090
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,540
10-times Defoe's is something that leads

1091
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,400
to really bad decisions being made and

1092
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,320
that leads to really really poisonous

1093
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,760
corporate cultures that can't adapt and

1094
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,380
that don't have the ability to fix it

1095
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,770
anyway this is like 10,000 word article

1096
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:31,440
so take your time on it but I think

1097
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,240
there you know this is hopefully because

1098
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,440
of the kind of self-reflection this is

1099
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,080
something that we're gonna be able to

1100
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,810
shed a little bit in the belly and then

1101
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,819
another key key component is that the

1102
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,080
key to predicting harm and that big part

1103
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,820
of that triangle right so in the InfoSec

1104
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,500
world we have a kind of a mental model

1105
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,180
of the bad things we want to stop we use

1106
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,160
the CIA triad and all that kind of stuff

1107
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,649
but we have an idea of what it means for

1108
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,500
people to change the execution of a

1109
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,240
program to do bad things we don't have a

1110
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,610
good mental model of what abuse is right

1111
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,680
the understanding of abuse really comes

1112
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,480
with empathy for the people who use the

1113
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,549
products and the key to having that

1114
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,010
empathy is a diversity of backgrounds

1115
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,200
and experiences look around this room

1116
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,130
right now look around go ahead take your

1117
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,870
time yeah this is not America it is

1118
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,060
certainly not representative of the

1119
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:20,549
world something like 4 billion people

1120
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,620
are walking around with pocket

1121
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,270
supercomputers that we slipped in there

1122
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,830
with always-on internet connections and

1123
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,630
these are the people who are figuring

1124
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,940
out what it means for those folks to be

1125
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,100
harmed or not that is a fundamental

1126
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,890
problem right the lack of diversity in

1127
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,330
industry and academia the lack of voices

1128
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,970
from the developing world especially

1129
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:41,279
mean that we have these humongous blind

1130
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,700
spots where there are entire classes of

1131
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,610
issues that we don't even consider

1132
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,529
because they're not compatible with our

1133
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,000
own personal experiences and so there's

1134
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,120
a couple things to do here the first

1135
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,740
thing is for us to obviously do lots and

1136
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,509
lots of work to diversify our industry

1137
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,270
right like we need to make this a lot

1138
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,950
more open field for people we need to

1139
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,940
make it welcoming we need to welcoming

1140
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,819
people with different kinds of

1141
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,760
backgrounds and different kinds of from

1142
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,830
different areas of academia the other

1143
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,880
thing I think is something a positive

1144
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,190
thing I think and I want to give use

1145
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,960
Nick's a shout out here is we also need

1146
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:18,480
to build structures for us to think

1147
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,700
about these problems in more thoughtful

1148
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,400
ways that instead of things just being

1149
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,290
based upon people's personal experiences

1150
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,940
that we have some intellectual

1151
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,670
structures for understanding what harm

1152
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,099
and abuses online and I think these

1153
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,780
conferences particularly

1154
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:35,670
USENIX are both notable for the

1155
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,980
diversity of the speakers on stage for

1156
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,349
the diversity of the attendees and for

1157
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,570
them tackling issues that are very very

1158
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,190
practical and that are not the kinds of

1159
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,109
things that ten years ago you would ever

1160
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,000
expect at an academic security

1161
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,549
conference in fact pepper which just

1162
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,740
ended I believe was this week

1163
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,630
turns out this is unofficial but is the

1164
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,910
most gender diverse conference in the

1165
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,910
history of USENIX right so that is a

1166
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,379
huge accomplishment and that the whole

1167
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,330
USENIX team should be very proud of the

1168
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,400
work they're doing and I hope the rest

1169
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,410
of the industry kind of takes a look

1170
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,080
here of the benefits that you get from

1171
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,490
from this kind of thinking okay so what

1172
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,859
can we do in academia

1173
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:17,118
now I'm gonna say we now that now that I

1174
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:20,390
work in the shadow of that big tower a

1175
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,310
couple things first I think we need to

1176
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,830
make sure the incentives and academic

1177
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,650
computer science are adjusted towards

1178
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,750
harm not towards complexity or headlines

1179
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,550
so one of my favorite papers from this

1180
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,810
week is actually this one privacy and

1181
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,880
security threat models and negation

1182
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:39,630
strategies of older adults this is

1183
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,940
effectively a paper capturing all of our

1184
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,520
experience which is every single person

1185
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,020
in this room has had to clean malware

1186
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,450
off of a computer during Thanksgiving

1187
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,310
break right every single person in this

1188
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,859
room has had the experience of sitting

1189
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,950
down with an older generally male member

1190
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:57,960
of their family and really wondering how

1191
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,939
could they possibly have two different

1192
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,540
crypto lockers three different search

1193
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,190
engine hijackers and and two different

1194
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,960
background processes that are tapping

1195
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,780
into the microphone fighting over

1196
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,430
control of the Windows kernel god help

1197
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,170
me what websites was this person

1198
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,270
visiting and then trying to mentally

1199
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,619
bleach that thought out of your mind

1200
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,200
and just focus on the technical side

1201
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,930
right every single one of us has had the

1202
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,129
experience this is an entire paper

1203
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,140
studying the issues of the safety and

1204
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,150
security issues for older folks and I

1205
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,670
think that is incredible work that does

1206
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,770
not fall within the

1207
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,270
normal definition of what is ACS hard

1208
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:35,210
problem what is the kind of thing that

1209
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:37,369
you can get a PhD for the other kinds of

1210
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,930
talks I said this is a talk from enigma

1211
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:39,740
this is a very interesting talk by

1212
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,660
Ashkan Soltani

1213
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,308
all about the different processes that

1214
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,500
go in to thinking about the ways your

1215
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:47,510
technology can be abused that kind of

1216
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,049
process focus is really really important

1217
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:53,150
we talk so much in academic security

1218
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:55,549
about the outcomes and there's so little

1219
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,230
study of the way software actually gets

1220
00:44:55,549 --> 00:44:58,940
built and the mistakes people make on

1221
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,190
the way and I'd love to see more and

1222
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,650
more looking at how we get there because

1223
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,270
the truth is the outcomes or things that

1224
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,170
can be fixed that doesn't mean it's not

1225
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,530
bad

1226
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,059
research but the process issues are the

1227
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,950
fundamental things that end up with all

1228
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:14,750
those outcomes and so if you move up the

1229
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,578
scale you can fight joke points that if

1230
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,630
you fix those choke points you end up

1231
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:18,920
avoiding these problems in the first

1232
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,640
place instead of trying to patch them

1233
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,329
out one by one

1234
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,848
I think academic computer science needs

1235
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:28,069
to really focus on supporting other

1236
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,480
disciplines so the truth is is for the

1237
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:32,029
vast majority of people who work in

1238
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,430
technology they are not the product they

1239
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,950
are the plumbing right for the vast

1240
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:39,109
majority every single company in the

1241
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,540
developed world is now effectively an IT

1242
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:45,200
company one thing I heard I when I was

1243
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,670
at Facebook we had these CTOs and CSOs

1244
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,569
visit from variety of different

1245
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,369
companies they would always do these

1246
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:51,558
Silicon Valley tours to go see how

1247
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:53,869
Silicon Valley companies make technology

1248
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:55,760
and a bunch of these companies banks

1249
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:57,950
retailers and stuff had more software

1250
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,510
engineers than Facebook did right they

1251
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,308
were effectively software companies

1252
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:04,309
software is eating the world is

1253
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:06,950
revolutionizing every part of industry

1254
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:08,750
but this doesn't really hold in academia

1255
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,160
where a computer science is still all

1256
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,450
about the computer science and that's

1257
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,859
fine it's great to study computer

1258
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,990
science computer science take but I

1259
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:16,549
think the other thing folks in CS need

1260
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,799
to think about is how are you going to

1261
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:20,569
support other disciplines in dealing

1262
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:23,359
with the fact that computer science 1

1263
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:25,099
right the the number one major at

1264
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,509
Stanford is CS and I know that's a real

1265
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,130
pain in the ass for Dan Bonet and the

1266
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,869
other folks who have to teach undergrads

1267
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,880
I mean I'm from public school where they

1268
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:34,130
say notice kids right I'm getting used

1269
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,540
to this idea that you can't say no to

1270
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,059
students who pay 51 thousand dollars a

1271
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,859
year it's it's a weird thing for me or

1272
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:42,240
give bees

1273
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:46,200
it turns out that's the thing

1274
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:49,049
I'm not kidding I was at Def Con last

1275
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,029
week blackhat I had a dinner the mother

1276
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:52,770
of a student brought up the fact that

1277
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:57,450
her daughter got a B+ in my class last

1278
00:46:52,770 --> 00:47:00,390
year at dinner in Vegas right so it's

1279
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,759
not not theoretical but anyway but like

1280
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,859
so the that is a great testament to the

1281
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,020
importance of Technology in people's

1282
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:09,420
lives that students are choosing to take

1283
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,190
computer science classes that means the

1284
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,390
research should follow and a bunch of

1285
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,950
the work Computer Sciences should do

1286
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,390
should just be like the technologists

1287
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,189
who are out in the world who don't do

1288
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,230
technology for technology's sake but use

1289
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,570
and help with technology being used for

1290
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,950
human advancement and so three people

1291
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,630
I'd love to call out who are doing great

1292
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,520
crosses pulling work on this way in this

1293
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,900
way Jennifer pan she's in the

1294
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,790
communication department at Stanford

1295
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,800
she's one of the world's experts in the

1296
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:33,259
Great Firewall of China in the way that

1297
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,310
Chinese propaganda networks work

1298
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,160
combines a bunch of different parts of

1299
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:40,200
sociology psychology communication and

1300
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,940
computer science you have folks like

1301
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,279
Gary Werner at the University of Alabama

1302
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,800
at Birmingham Gary does the most

1303
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,490
practical academic research into the bad

1304
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,050
things it happened on the internet

1305
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,970
BarNone right he has built this

1306
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,820
incredible powerhouse program that

1307
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:56,700
really should be reflected at the top 20

1308
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:58,530
CS universities but isn't yet and then

1309
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,118
folks like Kate Starbird who has like a

1310
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,160
traditional CS background but who's also

1311
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,330
combined it with her interest and how

1312
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,490
people actually use products actually

1313
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,259
get harmed online this kind of work I

1314
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,029
think is really really important and we

1315
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,280
need to make space for people to get

1316
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:13,349
PhDs for people to get awards for their

1317
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,270
their refereed papers to get accepted

1318
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:17,490
for people to be able to do computer

1319
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,960
science work that supports other people

1320
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:21,569
and understanding and fixing the world

1321
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,510
not just to push for the limits of

1322
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:26,670
computer science and we need to bring

1323
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,290
these lessons back to the classroom this

1324
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:31,770
is a really interesting piece of

1325
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:33,660
research recently and that these folks

1326
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:36,270
at this private security consultancy

1327
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,819
found an issue that is existed over and

1328
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:42,420
over again which is a bunch of the most

1329
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:44,700
important dating applications especially

1330
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,460
in the LGBT community all have the issue

1331
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,470
that by faking your GPS location you can

1332
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,510
triangulate the fine GPS location of

1333
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,250
everybody on it right this is a

1334
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,050
well-known flaw tinder actually had this

1335
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,430
bug I believe uber even had this bug a

1336
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,440
while ago

1337
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:00,029
and yet these kinds of lessons are not

1338
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,640
making it back in the classroom if you

1339
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:05,190
graduate even from a top CS program you

1340
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,328
don't understand the real kinds of harms

1341
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,369
that can happen from this kind of stuff

1342
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:10,380
because this isn't actually AC s hard

1343
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:12,569
problem it's not a traditional security

1344
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,339
issue it's a combination of kind of data

1345
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:16,470
protection and understanding the

1346
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:18,900
societal issues that affect people like

1347
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:22,529
this and then the users of your of your

1348
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,240
product and that combination is not

1349
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:26,640
really reinforced in the undergraduate

1350
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,020
world I'm actually so this is where I'll

1351
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,279
give a pitch for the work we're doing at

1352
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,380
Stanford we have this new internet

1353
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,480
Observatory and with the support of dr.

1354
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,190
Bonet we're actually putting together a

1355
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,319
class that focuses just on these kinds

1356
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:39,240
of issues that focuses on all the

1357
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,500
emergent issues of the internet and all

1358
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,060
the different kinds of abuse that fall

1359
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,609
outside of traditional information

1360
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,109
security we're gonna open source all

1361
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:47,910
this content I've got 18 people from

1362
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,930
industry who are helping build it so we

1363
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,259
have people from Microsoft Google

1364
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,879
Facebook Nick Nick thorne we have an FBI

1365
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,190
agent so we have a lot of people with

1366
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,230
practical experience who are putting

1367
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,520
content in here we're gonna open that

1368
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,319
source all that content we're looking

1369
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,750
for academic partners who want to teach

1370
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:05,160
it after we get the content done so if

1371
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,480
you were interested in perhaps bringing

1372
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,700
this class to your school and

1373
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,780
collaborating on it you can give me an

1374
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:16,310
email so in summary we've inherited the

1375
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:21,359
earth right the people in this room one

1376
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:24,410
yo and you know security has one when I

1377
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:26,430
was an undergrad at Cal there was no

1378
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:27,720
undergraduate security classes I had to

1379
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,339
take a graduate class actually from

1380
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,049
David Wagner and he was a grad student

1381
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:32,310
himself I think he had just decided that

1382
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,650
he wanted to teach it it wasn't

1383
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:38,009
something that was seen as a real field

1384
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:40,500
in the 90s and so you have David and Dan

1385
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:41,970
and other people in the early 2000s

1386
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,819
building out undergraduate security

1387
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:46,890
curriculums and security has clearly

1388
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:48,810
we've spent decades telling people that

1389
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:50,609
what we do is incredibly important so

1390
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,078
now we have to kind of live up to what

1391
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:54,089
we've told people right is we've told

1392
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,770
people we're the high priests of what

1393
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:57,180
happens online we understand the bad

1394
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,680
things that happen and so we're actually

1395
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,480
gonna have to get there and we're gonna

1396
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,970
have to make sure our work is tied to

1397
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,069
people's real lived experiences not to

1398
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,109
our belief of what are the bad things

1399
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:08,279
that we want to hunt down and what are

1400
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:10,049
the kinds of problems we want to work on

1401
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,430
so let's work together on

1402
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,840
let's work with industry on this and

1403
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:16,500
let's kind of live up to the

1404
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,880
expectations people have of us and you

1405
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,010
know the one thing that makes me really

1406
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,040
happy about what's going on right now

1407
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:24,480
is the students because every time every

1408
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,490
single undergrad who has come to one of

1409
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,290
my office hours wants to talk about how

1410
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:30,240
to make tech better every single one of

1411
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:32,430
them right they don't ask how can I make

1412
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,850
the most money they don't ask me where

1413
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,649
should I work that has the best snacks

1414
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:39,270
they ask me Alex I'm looking at

1415
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,280
different jobs what can I do to actually

1416
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,500
make things better and so there is a

1417
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,020
real desire from our students to make

1418
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:49,250
the world better let's help them do that

1419
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,250
thank you very much

1420
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:58,740
I think we got a five minutes if they

1421
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,100
may had any questions or some

1422
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:04,350
microphones here if folks yes sir thank

1423
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,299
you Alex I enjoyed hearing a beating for

1424
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:08,850
academia I can add a whole bunch of

1425
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,590
stories to it yeah but it still seems to

1426
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,290
me that you had a fundamental blind spot

1427
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:15,750
and that is that a lot of the stuff that

1428
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:18,600
we've done do we hear actually has been

1429
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:21,950
weaponized by industry today by

1430
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:25,380
well-meaning people who come up with

1431
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:27,000
ways to justify using all these side

1432
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,400
channels that you say are useless to

1433
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,970
track us to fingerprint us to collect

1434
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,790
data on us to you know that seems to be

1435
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:40,649
at least as much of the problem as all

1436
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:41,820
these other issues yeah so a first time

1437
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,250
I'm not trying to say anybody's research

1438
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,350
is useless I think all the research is

1439
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,880
great I just think the when we think

1440
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:49,589
about the incentive structure we set up

1441
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,090
the incentive structure should push

1442
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,980
people towards things that have real

1443
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,840
impact and usenix is actually a great

1444
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,970
example of this all of those papers that

1445
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,470
were discussed who won the awards all of

1446
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:01,470
the papers that have stood the test of

1447
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:02,790
time actually are talking about people's

1448
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,220
real problems there are other

1449
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:08,970
conferences and kind of academic fora in

1450
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:11,189
which I think complexity like is is and

1451
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,319
you know I had the hardest time getting

1452
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,510
the points for the difficulty score or

1453
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,670
the kind of the way people judge I agree

1454
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,650
I mean there is a continuous problem of

1455
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,960
the ideas in academia that are meant to

1456
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,880
be doing good things being turned that

1457
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,040
is the entire history of machine

1458
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,350
learning of every machine learning paper

1459
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,090
has at the end these are the positive

1460
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,160
societal things you can do and in the

1461
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:35,370
end all of their work ends up making ads

1462
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,750
more efficient right most and so I don't

1463
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,819
have I don't have a great solution there

1464
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,380
other than you know for people to think

1465
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,880
about those kinds of things I mean I

1466
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,140
think I think have less of that and

1467
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,030
security I think that more in the ml

1468
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,940
world that they really need to have to

1469
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:50,850
struggle with the work they're doing and

1470
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,560
to think about if I was going to make a

1471
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,759
profit off of this how would I use it I

1472
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:59,430
don't think that goes into most people's

1473
00:53:53,760 --> 00:54:01,440
calculations yes sir yeah remembering

1474
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,850
the your security threat pyramid from

1475
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,760
the beginning some of those big threats

1476
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:07,910
are pretty easy to fix like patching

1477
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:11,690
it's just stupid but patching just

1478
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:15,250
stupid so who here has ever had to patch

1479
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:21,350
more than a million servers Eric hand up

1480
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:22,730
okay not just like you let Windows

1481
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:25,279
Update run and like oh man I got a

1482
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,020
reboot right it's tough it does seem

1483
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,850
like a problem that should be easier

1484
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,380
self but passwords is actually

1485
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:33,920
interesting what do you think about

1486
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:36,350
solving that problem yeah so I mean

1487
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,790
we're just in this crazy world where you

1488
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,009
know the as everybody in this room knows

1489
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,870
the user name/password paradigm is comes

1490
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:44,900
from like 1970s timeshare architectures

1491
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:46,790
right and we're still using it in 2019

1492
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,490
with Pocket supercomputers with all

1493
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:51,230
these biometric sensors I think the

1494
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,810
movement web often is great I think the

1495
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,640
movement towards federated identity is

1496
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,140
good I understand that privacy trade-off

1497
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,170
this is one of those hard equities in

1498
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:01,549
the end though normal people are not

1499
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,630
going to be able to maintain credentials

1500
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,100
for hundreds of different sites so

1501
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,230
moving to a federated identity model

1502
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,060
that still preserves their per their

1503
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:10,580
security but then also provides like

1504
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,720
some because it's not just about their

1505
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,130
authentication credentials but there's

1506
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,689
so many situations with their actual

1507
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,800
physical identity or important so I

1508
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,230
think we need to move to a model where

1509
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,560
the identity providers are able to

1510
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:23,270
provide some level of nuance of this is

1511
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,620
how sure we are that this is this person

1512
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,740
and if there can be step-up

1513
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,940
authentication that is in a privacy

1514
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:31,490
preserving way that people can do that

1515
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,930
that's a great use of all this of all

1516
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:35,689
kinds of crypto ideas I've come out the

1517
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:37,609
last ten years the hard part is the

1518
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:39,830
account management lifecycle right so it

1519
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:41,450
is easy to replace passwords at the

1520
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,850
moment of authentication what is

1521
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,410
actually hard in industry is the

1522
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,509
craziest happens to normal people

1523
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,250
right they're like I lost my laptop and

1524
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,350
I lost my phone because my backpack was

1525
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:54,080
stolen in the airport how do I get my

1526
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:55,970
life back right those kinds of

1527
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,230
situations happen and I think the other

1528
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,750
thing we need to think about is the

1529
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:01,310
network effects one of my colleagues at

1530
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,810
Facebook Brad hill was working on this

1531
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,430
of how can you build networks of

1532
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:06,049
companies that kind of allow you to

1533
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:08,330
prove identity to one another to kind of

1534
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:09,440
recover your identity slowly I think

1535
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,310
we've got to think about those kinds of

1536
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,600
things and about much more use of

1537
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:17,029
step-up authentication and respect on

1538
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,470
occasion where we allow people to

1539
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,880
authenticate in different kinds of way

1540
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,200
and then treat them in different ways I

1541
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,270
don't think there's not a lot of good

1542
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,500
kind of mental models of how to do that

1543
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:29,500
but I think that's the future we'll move

1544
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:32,750
to I think this show ministers in the

1545
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:35,000
beginning portion you highlight that the

1546
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:37,010
tremendous fraction of things we deal

1547
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,420
with our abuse oriented and none of

1548
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,430
those problems individually are very

1549
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,109
hard to deal with it's that scale makes

1550
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,970
it very difficult to actually deal with

1551
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:45,230
yeah and so I'm curious if you have

1552
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:49,399
thoughts given this to an academic

1553
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:51,950
audience about the a way to improve

1554
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,420
academic academia is engagement on these

1555
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,980
problems of scale so the reality is

1556
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,900
there's a handful of people in the

1557
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,730
audience here who are successful at

1558
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:01,190
engaging with Facebook or Google and and

1559
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:02,630
able to work with datasets of scale and

1560
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,920
this is a data intensive problem because

1561
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:06,170
you need to see all the full things that

1562
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,150
people do and that's actually a very

1563
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:12,460
small fraction of our community who can

1564
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,830
engage and so what is the answer for

1565
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:18,020
harnessing academic research on problems

1566
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:20,119
of scale when very few people here get

1567
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,619
to look at data at scale yeah that's a

1568
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:24,380
great question I mean one of the funny

1569
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:28,369
things is there's there's only a handful

1570
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:29,900
of kind of open you know nonprofit

1571
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:32,000
projects that operate at any kind of

1572
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,790
reasonable scale like Wikipedia being

1573
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,859
one of the only examples of you know in

1574
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:39,500
the Alexa top 20 of something that is

1575
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:41,270
you know a non-profit that's open to

1576
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,950
working with people so I think one we

1577
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,780
need to try to find those situations and

1578
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:46,609
utilize them and when they exist right

1579
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,170
the handful of situations in which they

1580
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:49,130
don't have the commercial concerns this

1581
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,810
is actually something that's going the

1582
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,260
wrong direction on the current privacy

1583
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,210
debate

1584
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,010
none of the privacy discussions take

1585
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:57,170
into any other equities like one of the

1586
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,580
fundamental problems of GDP are to get

1587
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:00,950
on my high horse a little bit is that

1588
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,140
there's a this this problem of what's

1589
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,700
called competence in the you that the

1590
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,049
European Commission European Parliament

1591
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:08,029
does not have what's called national

1592
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,920
security competence they are not

1593
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:12,200
responsible for national security so as

1594
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,720
a result they promulgate privacy rules

1595
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,450
at a European level that then affect the

1596
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,618
security and safety decisions that are

1597
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,689
being made at the state level and

1598
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:22,430
there's not a good process for the

1599
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,470
German cops to tell the European

1600
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:26,029
Parliament that all the sudden they

1601
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,649
can't do their work anymore because gdpr

1602
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:29,359
means that their tech partners won't

1603
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,950
work with them anymore right and that is

1604
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,390
happening all over the place with the

1605
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,519
FTC consent decree that happened face

1606
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,900
of the word academic research word

1607
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,519
research does not show up anywhere in

1608
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,230
there right and so I actually think

1609
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:41,629
we're moving in the bad direction here

1610
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,640
in that the definition of what is right

1611
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,260
for people there's a very very specific

1612
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,180
definition of privacy that has nothing

1613
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,980
to do with actual harm and only has to

1614
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,980
do with data protection and kind of

1615
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,480
control of data and that is an important

1616
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,250
thing but it's not the only thing and

1617
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,809
the fact that we are moving so

1618
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,950
aggressively in that direction means

1619
00:58:56,809 --> 00:59:00,349
that the big companies are going to

1620
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,819
become more insular more monopolistic

1621
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:03,650
are gonna have less competition and

1622
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:04,910
there's to be less work for acting less

1623
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:07,519
ability for academics to understand

1624
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,960
what's going on I think we need to have

1625
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,479
projects to push back on that and to

1626
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,470
create safe spaces for the companies

1627
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,059
another colleague at Stanford Nate

1628
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:16,730
personally in the law school is working

1629
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:18,410
on this it's called social science 1 and

1630
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:22,519
he's working on a project to effectively

1631
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:24,649
allow academics in AF TCM gdpr

1632
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:28,490
compatible way get access to real data

1633
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:30,859
it is incredibly hard and they're not

1634
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:32,959
they're not succeeding so far and so

1635
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,819
finding projects like that at multiple

1636
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,920
universities and then publicly talking

1637
00:59:34,819 --> 00:59:39,470
about the need for carve outs and any

1638
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,420
laws that pass and any of these legal

1639
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,589
agreements to allow academics to do

1640
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,750
important work in privacy-preserving

1641
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:47,660
ways is important I think publishing

1642
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:49,460
more work on how can use things like

1643
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,319
differential privacy to allow you to do

1644
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,299
this kind of work without details is

1645
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:54,740
also going to be important but

1646
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,730
unfortunately it's it's actually the

1647
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,109
thing I think that's trending the wrong

1648
00:59:55,730 --> 01:00:02,289
way to be able to do at scale research

1649
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:05,598
and I think it's the last question yeah

1650
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:08,900
I'm wondering if folks from the business

1651
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,849
school or the law school are taking CS

1652
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,549
152 or if you've thought about cross

1653
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:16,099
registering it yeah the multi point

1654
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:18,619
triangle that you showed has some a lot

1655
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:20,240
of really interesting trade-offs and

1656
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:22,069
some of the some of us in this room

1657
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,598
think about those and as you mentioned

1658
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:26,269
they're no easy answers to many of them

1659
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,900
yeah but ultimately the decisions that

1660
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:35,089
get made are driven a lot of times by

1661
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:37,839
profit data collection getting people to

1662
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:41,269
click on more ads and even the

1663
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:43,220
settlement that you mentioned you sort

1664
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:45,370
of alluded to the you know scummy

1665
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,910
class-action lawyers

1666
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:50,920
but yahoo has lawyers too and a lot of

1667
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:53,140
those are business decisions like let's

1668
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,600
settle this and let's make it go away

1669
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,359
rather than continuing to pay legal fees

1670
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,410
or see this come to light right so the

1671
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,600
companies themselves have a

1672
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:04,600
responsibility as well to bring some of

1673
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:07,180
that to light and I would say that I

1674
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,650
hope that because a lot of the people

1675
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:12,490
making these decisions in these

1676
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:15,250
companies are not engineers but are

1677
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:16,660
lawyers and business folks I hope that

1678
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,310
they're taking your classes well I hope

1679
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:20,529
that you consider cross listing it and

1680
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:22,120
so because it seems incredibly useful I

1681
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:24,280
totally agree with everything you said

1682
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:26,109
the companies it is totally in their

1683
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,740
best interest to settle stuff instead of

1684
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:31,330
to have their dirty laundry out there

1685
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:34,089
you're right like I'm getting kind of

1686
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:35,890
irritated there's a there's every every

1687
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:37,570
month the Atlantic or New York or some

1688
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:40,540
kind of old East Coast magazine likes to

1689
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,850
publish something by a liberal arts

1690
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:44,320
major about if only computer scientists

1691
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,980
had taken more liberal arts classes the

1692
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:49,420
world would be a better place the least

1693
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:52,030
the least ethical people I've ever met

1694
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:54,310
in my career all had fancy Ivy League

1695
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:57,130
JD's and enbe MBAs right they weren't

1696
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:59,770
engineers and so you're totally right

1697
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,150
that that's an issue though the 152

1698
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:03,040
class eventually we will have a version

1699
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,570
for them I am teaching this thing called

1700
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,730
the hack lab which is a introduction to

1701
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:08,410
offensive security techniques for non CS

1702
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:10,000
majors and it's cross-listed with law so

1703
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:11,560
effectively I teach the lawyers how to

1704
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,210
use Bert proxy and Metasploit and stuff

1705
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,500
like that but the goal is to teach them

1706
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:17,230
some of the underlying technologies as

1707
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,060
well so I totally agree and then that's

1708
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:20,440
also I think something that academic CS

1709
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:22,810
can do is to go volunteer to teach those

1710
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,430
classes right I know it's tough because

1711
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:27,279
everybody here had probably has

1712
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:28,870
oversubscribed classes over and so it's

1713
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,240
hard to then go volunteer to teach ten

1714
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:33,730
or twelve to ELLs or three L's but I do

1715
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:36,729
think that is important yeah it's it's

1716
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,960
that's really good and I think it's it's

1717
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,310
really frustrating I think many of

1718
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:43,860
people in this room have done you know

1719
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:46,810
expert work and and you as well to see

1720
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,580
the truth get buried in the interest of

1721
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:50,140
the bottom line yet something that we

1722
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,220
see happen all the time but it's it's

1723
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,350
not us that are making those decisions

1724
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,850
off and it's it's the lawyers or the

1725
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:56,680
people who are in charge of the bottom

1726
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:57,730
line right right so there's - there's a

1727
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,990
couple fundamental issues there's the

1728
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,730
companies over legal

1729
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:02,830
their decisions and so they look at to

1730
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:04,570
legal and PR risk as their guiding light

1731
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,920
in the way they make these decisions but

1732
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,869
then also the incentive structure is

1733
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,790
messed up right there is no incentive to

1734
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:13,000
come out like the ASRs system I showed

1735
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:14,500
there is no incentive to ever say we had

1736
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,810
a near-miss right

1737
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:20,410
we had a breach but we caught it nobody

1738
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:22,750
ever announces that and so we also need

1739
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:24,399
laws to pass to create penalties for

1740
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,990
people to not talk about this stuff but

1741
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,610
then also to create safe harbors so they

1742
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:30,100
can because right now what happens is if

1743
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,480
you said I had a near miss you will end

1744
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,670
up with a class-action lawsuit even if

1745
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,710
there's no real consumer harm for a

1746
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:38,140
variety of probably for like shareholder

1747
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:39,730
stuff because you didn't say exactly I'm

1748
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,980
gonna have a near miss in your last 10k

1749
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:44,230
and so you'll get sued over that and so

1750
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,640
we have to change the legal structures

1751
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:47,650
so that people are incentivized to be

1752
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,210
honest and open and non set device to

1753
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,640
hide things anyway thank you so much

1754
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:56,370
have a great show

1755
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,370
[Applause]
