1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,759
okay good morning and welcome to the

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,770
security education panel thanks for

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,380
joining us pretty early this morning

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,630
today we're gonna cover a wide range of

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,599
topics from developer and student

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,240
education to CTF competitions and

7
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,340
diversity in computing we'd like this

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,680
panel to be interactive so please come

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,199
up to the mic in the center as soon as

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,910
you have a question even right now if

11
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:39,099
you already have a question I'm gonna

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,140
kick off with some introductions and a

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,540
couple of questions and then we'll make

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,640
this interactive from there so we're

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,640
today I have Justin Kappas who's a

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,230
professor at New York University Justin

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,600
and his students focus on solving

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,610
real-world security problems in practice

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,890
and his team's research has been

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,980
productionize by docker get Python

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,710
VMware and a bunch of other companies

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,080
that I won't list here I'm also joined

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,539
by Matt Bishop who's a professor at UC

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,250
Davis many of us probably know Matt

25
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:11,710
because of his book which we probably

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,530
had when we're an undergrad or grad

27
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:18,369
school computer security art and science

28
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:22,810
Matt also co-chaired the joint ACM I

29
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:25,390
Triple E a is sick CIF IP Task Force on

30
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,840
cybersecurity education which developed

31
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,660
curricular guidelines for cyber security

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,209
and finally I'm also joined by Douglas

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,848
Raja who is a professor at the

34
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,410
University of Rochester Douglas has been

35
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:40,630
teaching computer security for the past

36
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,069
thirty years and he's unique to our

37
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,259
panel and that he teaches at an

38
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:46,479
undergraduate only institution so he has

39
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,030
a little different perspective than some

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,450
of us who also have PhD students in our

41
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,910
universities so to get started I'd like

42
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,830
to ask our panelists to tell us where

43
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,670
they think security education should be

44
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,410
taking place should it be exclusively in

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,660
academia should we be trying to teach

46
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,209
everyone what they need to know before

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,619
they get out into industry or once

48
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,230
they're in industry should they be

49
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,880
getting specialized training on the

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,980
specific security things they need to

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,540
know rather than sort of getting a brain

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:22,488
dump when they're in school Thanks

53
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,060
so I'll go ahead and take this first so

54
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,220
first of all I think our keynote that we

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,140
had really underscored on the first day

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,079
there's a big gap between academia and

57
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,730
industry and I think that that is

58
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,370
something of a shame I think we need to

59
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,140
do what we can to educate students and

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,430
make them prepare to do the real world

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,440
sorts of things that they're going to do

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,750
when they go out there that doesn't mean

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,329
that we need to be sort of a tech

64
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,010
training school that go you know rather

65
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,690
than teaching a networks class that

66
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,849
tells them the fundamentals is teaching

67
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,920
them how to set up Cisco routers but I

68
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,200
think that the things that we do and we

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,390
reinforce need to reinforce those

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,409
practical real-world things which is why

71
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,388
when I teach for instance we'll do

72
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,858
actual like security audits of startups

73
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,170
and things like that that will have come

74
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:12,980
in and present and we'll do things like

75
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,440
work with work to fix bugs in Debian fix

76
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,179
security bugs in Debian distributions or

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:24,440
arch linux or other things like this as

78
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:26,419
part of it I think the security

79
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,699
education actually needs to be in both

80
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:31,579
and I very much agree with what Justin

81
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:34,220
was saying that in academia you should

82
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,049
you teaching primarily principles

83
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,790
fundamentals that sort of thing

84
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,459
but you if you can use real-world

85
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,650
examples to support those for example

86
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,379
how to configure a Cisco router and

87
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,560
networking and so forth that adds a lot

88
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,989
of value for the students but the

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,150
industry each industry in fact each

90
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:57,019
company in my experience has its own

91
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:00,049
unique requirements and so to plan a

92
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,840
program that would allow someone to walk

93
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,750
out walk into a company and immediately

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,569
begin doing security would require the

95
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,250
program to know very much how that

96
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,198
company is working how that's what their

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,579
security setup is and so forth and

98
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,728
that's not really something that

99
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,978
academics that we can do in a short

100
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:21,168
period of time that we have the students

101
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,810
but what we should do is give them the

102
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:26,330
foundation so that they can walk in and

103
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,659
very quickly learn that stuff and if the

104
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,460
company changes something for example

105
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:33,349
they can build on what we've taught them

106
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,998
in order to make the change relatively

107
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,709
painless

108
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:39,639
instead of having to start over from

109
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:42,569
scratch I'm gonna largely agree with the

110
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,869
previous two speakers Richmond's a

111
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:50,229
liberal arts university so when we teach

112
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:52,329
any computer science we're thinking we

113
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,949
want to teach them fundamentals things

114
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:57,039
that principles that they can take with

115
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,899
them and use throughout their career if

116
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,878
I teach them some technology that may be

117
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,989
obsolete in five years then we really

118
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,049
haven't done our job

119
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:07,539
and I'll also agree with Matt that every

120
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:09,698
industry has its own requirements and we

121
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,558
couldn't possibly train our students to

122
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,589
be prepared to walk in on the first day

123
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:17,019
and and go right to work using these

124
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:19,809
technologies we couldn't fit it in our

125
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,789
curriculum especially since being

126
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:23,649
primarily undergraduate they're going to

127
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,360
be taking lots of other courses so their

128
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:30,879
security course may be one of ten

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,799
courses they've taken in a year another

130
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,589
thing that's been popping up is that

131
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,938
there are a number of boot camps

132
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:38,499
emerging for mobile development and

133
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,569
front-end development and sometimes

134
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:42,369
these are seen as being a little bit in

135
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,279
competition with the traditional sort of

136
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:47,110
university academic model it was curious

137
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,079
whether you see a future for cyber

138
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,309
security or privacy boot camps and if

139
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,499
you think that's a good thing or

140
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,079
something that jeopardizes maybe the

141
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:59,439
traditional sort of four-year education

142
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:01,899
in computer science I I think it's

143
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,269
definitely a good thing if if somehow

144
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:06,429
someone is able to and I don't know a

145
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:07,719
few days or a week like teach enough

146
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:10,058
that somebody can be a competent

147
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:13,509
security professional then I'd really

148
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:14,799
like to see that for me I I've gone and

149
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,959
done a lot of these types of things

150
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:18,638
especially for instance outreach to high

151
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,669
school girls or other underserved

152
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,219
communities and just getting them to

153
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,779
learn how to open combination locks that

154
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:27,819
they have a legal right to open but they

155
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,579
don't know the combination to or other

156
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,259
things like that is just I don't know

157
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,429
kind of opens a new world for them and

158
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,039
they start to look at things in a new

159
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:37,748
way so I think they often build more

160
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,739
excitement and give a thirst for more

161
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:43,269
rather than as a completion of a journey

162
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:46,109
where you end up with a trained

163
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,110
professional at the end

164
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,270
I think that the tork are actually

165
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,770
complementary the boot camps are

166
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,530
week-long programs that typically teach

167
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,740
something intensively like riding mobile

168
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,690
apps and such and in the week my own

169
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,000
experiences you can't really get to the

170
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,969
fundamentals underlying that but you

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,400
sure can't get the kids curious and

172
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,169
excited about doing it and in many cases

173
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,690
they go on to take courses that will

174
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:16,000
show them that so I think the two are

175
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,530
quite complimentary and they very much

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,690
agree with what Justin said that

177
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,130
sometimes it opens completely new ways

178
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,630
of thinking

179
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,700
California is something called the

180
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,950
cosmos program which deals with high

181
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,530
school students and we've done that a

182
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,690
couple of years and the excitement on

183
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,229
the kids at the end it was absolutely

184
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,200
wonderful

185
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:37,570
we also they also got tours of security

186
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,039
companies and such so I think there's a

187
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:44,199
place for both of them and they're

188
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,520
complementary yes it at Richmond in

189
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,930
particular has a couple I don't mean

190
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,870
University but I mean the city has a

191
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,220
couple of things we have code our VA

192
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,050
that are like camps that teach not

193
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,000
specifically security but teach computer

194
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,030
science we have Capital One holds events

195
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,210
that can be a week-long that that can

196
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,609
they can focus towards general audiences

197
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,400
or toward underrepresented groups but in

198
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,740
either case I think there I love having

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,388
students who've been in them primarily

200
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,919
because when I lecture in class they're

201
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,539
if they haven't seen certain things

202
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,159
before then they don't know why I'm

203
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,860
teaching them something and yes it's my

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,810
job to get across to them this is this

205
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,639
is why this is important but if they've

206
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,889
seen something in one of these camps and

207
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,169
they know what they're working toward it

208
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:31,990
makes it reinforces their learning it

209
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,640
really helps them say I know where this

210
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,349
is going I know something where this is

211
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,419
going so I really do have to know this

212
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,289
as opposed to will I ever really use

213
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,760
this right and one other thing that jog

214
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,069
my memory with some of this is that

215
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,660
we've also started to move to a model

216
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,610
where even people that have graduated

217
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,829
out of our program or things like this

218
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,450
as new technologies or new techniques or

219
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,510
new security relevant things come along

220
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,150
they can go back and take modules and

221
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,410
get like you know a couple days worth of

222
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,449
Education on some new

223
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,730
topic or some you know hey kubernetes

224
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,199
security wasn't something that anybody

225
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,410
cared about five years ago because there

226
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:11,709
was no kubernetes right so people coming

227
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,449
out of our you know of our program can

228
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,739
kind of take almost these many boot

229
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:16,569
camps and things like this

230
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,399
to keep themselves to keep their skills

231
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:21,360
at a very high level so I think that

232
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,240
also has a role to play in the ecosystem

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,180
thank you come up with questions if you

234
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,250
have them at any time so we heard in the

235
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,790
invited talk yesterday from Archer

236
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,740
chance about developer education and

237
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,449
we've heard a lot about developers not

238
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,269
setting parameters correctly developers

239
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:42,910
doing X Y Zed kinds of things and I was

240
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:45,670
curious whether you think this is maybe

241
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,709
a case of like developer lack of empathy

242
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,370
where they aren't thinking about what

243
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,388
might happen to users is it a case of

244
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,220
developers just not having those skills

245
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:56,500
when they come out of school what might

246
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,610
we do to fix these like developer

247
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,350
problems that we keep hearing about yeah

248
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,839
I think it's it's difficult and I don't

249
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,300
think there's like the one true magic

250
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,370
bullet I think that the recipient of the

251
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,130
bullet is always the developer but I

252
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,500
think that's often unfair because a lot

253
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,120
of times it's like the language designer

254
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,829
the people who wrote the libraries or

255
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,300
things that put the developer in a

256
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,279
position where it was easy for them to

257
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,609
shoot themselves in the foot or it were

258
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,899
you know there's a big shortage of

259
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,370
people and so you have a lot of people

260
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,290
that maybe haven't had any formal

261
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,949
training going and writing code in

262
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,740
certain languages like PHP that causes a

263
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:40,779
lot of these issues but I think it's

264
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,069
it's it's difficult I I wouldn't I don't

265
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,779
know that there are develop many

266
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:45,729
developers that go and say I just want

267
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,089
to do a crappy job and I don't care

268
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,380
about security but you know there are

269
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:54,089
pressures and other things that happen

270
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,439
and everybody makes mistakes I think the

271
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,110
pressures and such is a very good point

272
00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:01,839
I also think one of the issues we have

273
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,149
in academia is in your first programming

274
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,430
class you're taught how to program check

275
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,740
for errors and things like that but as

276
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,709
you go on in your in your university

277
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,540
career the emphasis

278
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,340
much more placed on getting the right

279
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,860
answer or writing the algorithm

280
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,840
correctly or that sort of thing and not

281
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,760
so much well what happens if the input

282
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:26,820
is bogus and so I think continuing to

283
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,590
focus on that and emphasizing it would

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,070
really improve certain would prove

285
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,810
things we've been doing a project funded

286
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,730
by NSF called the secure programming

287
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,449
clinic which functions like a writing

288
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,600
clinic and we've it the measurements

289
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,720
that we're taking show that it does

290
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,100
improve things providing the class

291
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,870
emphasizes that says you have to use

292
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,290
this part of your grade depends upon it

293
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,290
that said once you come out and go into

294
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,630
industry often the pressure is not well

295
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,910
let's build it very safely and securely

296
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,050
it's well if we're not first to market

297
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,490
we're gonna lose our market share so

298
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,209
let's get it out there now and we'll fix

299
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,540
it later

300
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,880
and at that point the problem becomes

301
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,170
how do you get the people how do you get

302
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,970
the students who know how to do this

303
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,680
stuff how do you give them the support

304
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:18,600
to apply it and quite frankly that's an

305
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,250
answer I don't know given the market

306
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,890
given the marketplace and the

307
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,420
cybersecurity invite this cyber the

308
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,910
computer environment I was gonna say

309
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,069
cyber but I understand that's a synonym

310
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,829
for cyber security in a lot of places um

311
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,420
one other comment which Justin made

312
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,850
about the burden falling on the

313
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,969
developer I've heard a lot of talk about

314
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,340
what we have to certify programmers

315
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,020
that's my big complaint about it because

316
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,280
when the programmers are certified if

317
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,860
something comes out that they've written

318
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,290
that's bad then they're the ones who are

319
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,180
in trouble not the people who did the

320
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,500
support libraries and such and not the

321
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,500
companies that are putting pressure on

322
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,090
them so if we're going to certify things

323
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,910
I would really rather see the companies

324
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:03,120
certified as opposed to the individuals

325
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:07,050
so that way everyone has a stake in the

326
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,350
game so to speak everyone has has will

327
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,959
get everyone has a requirement that they

328
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,640
do things well and that they support the

329
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:21,180
internal people who are trying to do

330
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:22,530
things so I I'm I start with saying what

331
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,239
I think both my colleagues said was you

332
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,189
know development is difficult

333
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,779
so it's not it's not we make it sound

334
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,910
like it's this easy thing if we educate

335
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,499
people right they'll do it well and all

336
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,300
sorts of studies have shown that even

337
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,439
the best coders are going to make a

338
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,508
certain amount of mistakes you know

339
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:39,420
every 100 lines of code or 50 lines of

340
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:42,029
code but you both talked about pressure

341
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,889
and I'm thinking back to my first time

342
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,110
coding commercially where my manager

343
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,059
came to me and said you have three weeks

344
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,619
to build a prototype that works don't

345
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,050
worry about the bells and whistles just

346
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:55,230
make sure it doesn't XY and Z you'll

347
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,179
have time to to polish it up and fix the

348
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,740
code and do it the right way once you

349
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,970
have a working prototype and when the

350
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,079
three weeks were up and I handed them

351
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,300
the working prototype he immediately

352
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,529
said I said well now can I clean it up

353
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,868
now that I've written and I know I know

354
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,999
how I would do this better no no we need

355
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:12,569
this this isn't this so it never gets

356
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:14,339
cleaned up and so as you were saying

357
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,959
that the coder gets blamed if coders are

358
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,769
certified but there's an environment

359
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,359
that is encouraging you to just throw

360
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:23,910
something down that gets the right

361
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,249
answer even if it's not secure even if

362
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,309
there are vulnerabilities that the coder

363
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:31,829
themselves may not know about and I

364
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,049
don't see how you address this given the

365
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,878
market forces I understood why they were

366
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:40,649
asking me to do that get it to market

367
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:43,230
fast what one other point often these

368
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:46,019
security requirements are not clear at

369
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,759
the time the program is written and so

370
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,069
you'll write the program to do one thing

371
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,209
and then someone will discover what wait

372
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,740
a minute if we move it into this

373
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:55,498
environment all of a sudden it's going

374
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,449
to work very well here not understanding

375
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,249
that that environment has certain things

376
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,799
that the requirements for this

377
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:04,740
environment cannot satisfy and so the

378
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,129
program doesn't work right so that's

379
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,589
another issue with development and

380
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,139
actually often the security parameters

381
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:16,769
are non-existent

382
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:18,779
yes the first couple of questions were

383
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,600
regarding education but it focused on

384
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:25,019
the college level what do you think

385
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,470
about k12 or even before k12 and what

386
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,329
should be done at that level oh yeah

387
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:34,189
that's a great question thank you very

388
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:36,628
much I think that you absolutely can

389
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:38,640
spark excitement and get people

390
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,640
interested in things

391
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,800
I've I found that a lot of the same

392
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,439
physical security type exercises that I

393
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,449
do for you know in the first week or so

394
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,180
to get my students interested you know

395
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,190
even master students work very well at

396
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,650
the high school level I think also a lot

397
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,240
of discussion around the technologies

398
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,750
that people use in their everyday lives

399
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,700
like Facebook and you know those

400
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,460
tracking devices that everybody except

401
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,530
for me seems to carry around that you

402
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,630
know that listen to everything you say

403
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,060
and know where you are and call you cars

404
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,040
and stuff like that but just talking

405
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,410
about those devices and how they use

406
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,250
them and what their usage patterns means

407
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:24,530
I think also helps people to see the

408
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:28,020
world around them and to really sort of

409
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:31,110
connect computer science and computer

410
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,689
security to their world in a way that

411
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:40,860
otherwise they was just this invisible

412
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:42,540
force behind the scenes yes with k12 I'm

413
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,990
not real sure what you could do at the

414
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,400
kindergarten level that would be

415
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,800
specific to computer science but

416
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,230
certainly at the higher grades in high

417
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:57,349
school you can one of the things have

418
00:16:52,230 --> 00:17:01,170
found is they love to break things so

419
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:06,140
showing them how failing to check for

420
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:08,520
bad inputs or things like that work

421
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,990
generally gets them laughing and accept

422
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,540
laughing and they very much interested

423
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,130
and then showing them how to fix it or

424
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:20,369
how to do it right does as well also

425
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,930
exposing them to strange problems for

426
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,739
works well the one thing you have to

427
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,720
watch out when you do that is googling

428
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,850
we on our cosmos once we give them a

429
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,250
problem to basically write a program

430
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,560
that printed itself and it was amazing

431
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,020
that most of the students very quickly

432
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,000
started googling but one person started

433
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:48,389
writing and actually did it on her own

434
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:51,450
which was very impressive so so I have a

435
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,960
daughter who started doing computer

436
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,580
science

437
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,419
she's 14 now it's just starting high

438
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,039
school in a couple of weeks but she

439
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:01,559
started doing some type of coding via

440
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,230
scratch and things like this I wouldn't

441
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,590
I want to say about six years ago so I

442
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,630
think introducing kids to computer

443
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,740
science concepts when they're young is

444
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,630
great the problem I've seen is that it's

445
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,270
just hard to find qualified people to do

446
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,799
this my own experience my son I have

447
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,418
another son who's a senior this year and

448
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,299
he took his first he took a first real

449
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,460
apcs course last year in was learning

450
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,559
Java and I looked at the assignments and

451
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,960
I thought I know this teacher is

452
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,668
well-meaning but these assignments are

453
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,140
obscuring what he's supposed to be

454
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,970
learning you know they're teaching about

455
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,490
loops and instead he's he's getting

456
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,049
bogged down in the in the gooey stuff

457
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,960
that they're trying to do to make it fun

458
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:44,158
and and the real actual part of the code

459
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,929
that he's supposed to be learning is

460
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,110
just three or four lines the rest of it

461
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:51,029
is all making the GUI work so you know I

462
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,178
mean it's hard to find science teachers

463
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,980
at that young event for you know k-12

464
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,690
science teachers it's really hard to

465
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,090
find people who can teach say yes and

466
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,980
and while I may have some issues with

467
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,470
the particular teacher who I said I

468
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,260
think overall he did a good job until

469
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,049
about four years ago there were no CS

470
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,179
teachers or no CS courses in our entire

471
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,649
County and were one of the best you know

472
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,940
they're constant consistently ranked one

473
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:18,389
of the best in the country but there

474
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,330
were no high school CS courses so it's

475
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,860
hard to find people to do this by the

476
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,330
way I'd like to clarify one thing I said

477
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,449
I said it's rather hard to teach

478
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,809
kindergarten students and such I should

479
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,110
point out that some of the students seem

480
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:36,059
to innately know this stuff for example

481
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,979
one of my children who was about three

482
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:41,190
years old we had a babysitter come over

483
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,960
because we were going out and so when he

484
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,169
came back the next thing I knew on the

485
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,750
desktop there were about 80 folders and

486
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,399
a game that he liked to play was buried

487
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:54,600
20 folders down in one of those 80

488
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,070
folders granted that's not real security

489
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,510
in the sense that it was very easy to

490
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,110
figure out but at least he had the right

491
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,510
mindset of trying to obscure things so

492
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,340
sometimes you can have fun like that

493
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,310
thank you

494
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,679
and I wanted to welcome Rahim via he's

495
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,200
also joining us he's a Motorola

496
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,300
foundation professor in the school of

497
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,250
Electrical and Computer Engineering at

498
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,169
Georgia Tech and he's also the executive

499
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,000
director of their online masters and

500
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,750
cybersecurity programs so if you have

501
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,710
online education questions as well you

502
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,120
would be happy to answer them tomorrow

503
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,820
so I've definitely heard some people

504
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,169
talk about the fact that it's

505
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,939
unfortunate that our approach to

506
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,470
teaching cyber security security in

507
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,210
undergraduate is like there's an

508
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,730
elective near the end where you kind of

509
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,740
throw a blob of security stuff after

510
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,950
they've you know been learning all along

511
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,530
so some people say that the way to go is

512
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,110
to try to sort of integrate at least a

513
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,090
number of little modules depending on

514
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,250
the size don't not the technical meaning

515
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,709
of module along the way as students are

516
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,080
actually learning to code and you see

517
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,850
some projects that are trying to build

518
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,590
repositories of these kinds of things

519
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,230
I was wondering your opinions on that

520
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,990
and if you've had any personal

521
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:13,700
experience seeing that done or trying to

522
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:17,540
do that with others and any things like

523
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:22,190
that yeah so I think it would be great

524
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:24,350
to have this integrated more and I have

525
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,940
so I've created a bunch of security

526
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,310
materials and modules that have been

527
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,950
used by other people including one

528
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,450
program that did try to integrate it

529
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,020
some of this they tried to integrate it

530
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,700
into cs1 and I think that was too early

531
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:41,210
that was basically their feedback I

532
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,010
could see this working well in in other

533
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,680
programs but I'm interested if anyone

534
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:50,540
else has first-hand experience doing it

535
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:52,040
so so yes at Richmond we do we do

536
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,170
introduce security and I don't want to

537
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,600
say that we that we have for example

538
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,520
sections in our cs1 course where we talk

539
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,649
about security but when I'm teaching

540
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,200
Java or Python or whatever I'm teaching

541
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,360
I will be talking about issues I'll be

542
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,010
talking about one one of my pet peeves

543
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,050
is opening a textbook and seeing that

544
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,490
you declare the type of a variable so

545
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,370
you know the size of the memory you need

546
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,680
to store it and I'm like no there's so

547
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,080
much more to it and and so we talked

548
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,779
about concepts and primarily

549
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,840
because the security course is offered

550
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,789
once every two years and a lot of

551
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,620
students won't take it

552
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:31,090
our purpose isn't so much to teach

553
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:34,399
security as to make students who will

554
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,408
maybe go out and become developers aware

555
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:38,719
of the issues that are out there and how

556
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:40,789
a simple mistake can cause all sorts of

557
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,210
problems for example in my networks

558
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:48,260
class I leave a an originally unintended

559
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,580
buffer overflow in a project and I could

560
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,320
have fixed it but I left it there years

561
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,360
ago because ultimately what happens is a

562
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,010
lot of students end up overwriting one

563
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,479
of their own variables without realizing

564
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,860
it they perform a buffer overflow on

565
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,750
themselves and and that lesson you know

566
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,209
it's that sticks with them as I go this

567
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,490
is this thing that can happen and I need

568
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,700
to be aware of this when I code so it

569
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,730
has been successful at least at raising

570
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,250
awareness that there are issues beyond

571
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,320
making your code work that are really

572
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,750
important so it sounds like that's

573
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:26,450
something that sort of you personally do

574
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:28,309
in your course rather than like a so

575
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,679
awesomely isn't the word I would use

576
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:36,710
maybe adequately semi adequately

577
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:39,320
mediocre ly but it's not just me so yeah

578
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,639
I think generally I mics I'm the one

579
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,189
that focuses on security in the

580
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:46,370
department but my colleagues are very

581
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,630
aware of these issues and in fact

582
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,750
several of them have been to use Nick's

583
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:54,320
in the past but even though they're not

584
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,080
security people so it's it's really

585
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,408
across the board issue that we want to

586
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,299
be aware of this but it isn't I want to

587
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,889
stress it's not there's a module in this

588
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:06,110
course when I'm talking about

589
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:08,389
architecture I mean when I'm teaching

590
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,250
architecture I will be talking as issues

591
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:12,049
come up I will be mentioning this is

592
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,559
something that's important for this

593
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,299
reason so we make them aware of it you

594
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,279
know I would only have anecdotal

595
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:19,820
evidence as to how well that works once

596
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,840
they get out

597
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,340
I mean I'll make a general comment in

598
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,070
first let me apologize for being late

599
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,510
one other role that you probably don't

600
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,908
even know about about two months ago I

601
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,009
was crazy enough to accept

602
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,529
one of our vice presidents for research

603
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:40,109
roles at Georgia Tech and what I found

604
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:43,809
is often there are very various size

605
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:45,369
emergencies that require attention and I

606
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,950
had one of those this morning so I

607
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,759
apologize even though I'm I got here 24

608
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,009
hours ago

609
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,669
I apologize for for coming in late I

610
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:56,710
really I like the idea of integrating

611
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,999
secured essentially in every course

612
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,229
we're mentioning it in every course

613
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:02,049
because I think it totally makes sense

614
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:03,820
but what we found and I'll be honest at

615
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:06,729
Tech is that most of our security Falcon

616
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,289
II you usually shy away from the lower

617
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:11,259
level courses they're usually focused on

618
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:14,049
graduate courses and in sort of senior

619
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:16,779
level security courses and that leaves

620
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:19,149
other folks who are teaching our intro

621
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,950
level courses who they appreciate that

622
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:22,899
security is important but they also have

623
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,669
many other priorities that are important

624
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:27,969
to them as well so it's not as important

625
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:29,019
as us so if I were teaching intro to

626
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,749
programming course I would certainly

627
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:33,639
mention that and do a little module on

628
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:35,499
security but unfortunately our

629
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:37,478
colleagues are not because they are

630
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:44,710
focused on so many other areas that are

631
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:48,519
priorities for them thank you one one

632
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:50,739
quick comment Davis we have a fairly we

633
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,570
have a strong security program what that

634
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:55,960
means is a lot of faculty collaborate

635
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,629
with us and a lot of them we have joint

636
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,849
grants with some networks visualization

637
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:03,099
and other groups and what what's

638
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:05,799
happened is that those faculty have

639
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:10,029
integrated some security into the

640
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:12,070
courses they teach it's again like I

641
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:14,499
said it's not a module or anything like

642
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:18,759
that it's just an awareness running

643
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:21,279
throughout the course and I think quite

644
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,549
frankly that's the best that seems to

645
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,249
work very well one other comment

646
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,989
robustness which is a really component

647
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,869
of security although it's not really

648
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:33,700
that often talked about is something

649
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:35,859
that can be integrated into almost any

650
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,599
classes our lower division ones do that

651
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:39,668
they don't talk about security

652
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,740
principles or things like that certainly

653
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:43,950
on that

654
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,080
but it's more like watch your inputs in

655
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,210
the networking class I know they talk

656
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,279
specifically about security I believe

657
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,990
they do in the architecture and a couple

658
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,570
of other classes but again the emphasis

659
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,820
here is on integrating it throughout the

660
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,200
course not by the way here's everything

661
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,158
you know about networks oh yeah and

662
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,960
let's talk about security you know hi

663
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,119
I'm Dave balancin from SR I

664
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,009
international I want to build on the

665
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,689
question and asked earlier this also

666
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:11,669
relates a little bit to the previous

667
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,129
question and it's actually three

668
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,710
questions but they're they're part of a

669
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:19,379
theme so there's a lot more to computers

670
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,379
than just science so I'd be interested

671
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:24,949
in knowing not just k12 but what do you

672
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:28,699
see is the role of vocational schools

673
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,809
also the multi-disciplinarian aspects of

674
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,399
computers in a particular computer

675
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:35,549
security and privacy so dealing with

676
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:39,629
business legal economic behavioral

677
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:42,570
social aspects and then maybe Matt you

678
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:45,029
could talk a little bit about the CSEC

679
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,350
and how it addresses some of this and

680
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,960
I'd be curious to hear from the others

681
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,369
what they think about CSEC but in short

682
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
you know computers are part of

683
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,668
everything and we can't just teach the

684
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,860
science and security in the context of

685
00:27:53,669 --> 00:28:00,059
computers we got to teach it as part of

686
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:04,459
everything just like computers are ok

687
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:07,889
let me take the CSEC one first CSEC has

688
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,049
seven knowledge areas four of which are

689
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:11,908
generally technical three of which would

690
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:16,158
normally would be seen as non-technical

691
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:18,749
organizational societal and human and in

692
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,499
CSEC in each of the knowledge knowledge

693
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:23,519
units

694
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:28,129
sorry knowledge areas there is what we

695
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:30,299
call basically learning essentials which

696
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:32,969
lists several things that anyone

697
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:35,309
studying security or anyone who's

698
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,980
dealing with security should know now

699
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:39,990
cset does not say you must teach a B C

700
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,690
and D what it says is here's a

701
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,129
smorgasbord pick out what you wanted to

702
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,259
pick out what you think would be most

703
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:48,299
valuable in your course and then teach

704
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,820
it however is appropriate for your

705
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,100
course and we're getting instantiation

706
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,620
of this that are going up on the ACM

707
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,770
website

708
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,620
but throughout one of the things we were

709
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,360
most aware of was that you have to teach

710
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,059
security or you have to deal with

711
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:08,860
security in law in medicine in business

712
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:11,770
even the in humanities and so the focus

713
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,899
of CSEC is broad enough so that for

714
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,010
example we we would not expect the

715
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,110
lawyer to be able to do a buffer

716
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,940
overflow be great if they could but it's

717
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,219
not normally part of legal education on

718
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:25,150
the other hand we would expect them to

719
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,549
know well what however our vulnerability

720
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,500
is endemic throughout software and what

721
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:31,360
can happen as a result that sort of

722
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,690
thing but again it's really up to the

723
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,668
individual instructor the CSEC is twenty

724
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,799
seventeen or cyber security curricular

725
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:43,470
guidelines and the emphasis is on

726
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:47,860
guidelines it's not prescriptive in

727
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:49,720
terms of the other questions we again I

728
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,939
know that they're taught in various

729
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,580
courses elsewhere but from a very

730
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,649
different point of view and I agree with

731
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,840
you fully it needs to be across a large

732
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:01,149
part of the curriculum many different

733
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,949
disciplines also in part because a lot

734
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:06,520
of web developers and such come out of

735
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,520
art or the humanities and if they have

736
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,610
never seen attacks or never seen how to

737
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:18,610
program to prevent those attacks or to

738
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:20,049
handle those attacks good luck so as I'm

739
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,320
listening to this I'm struck by the

740
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:25,750
thought that you know it's not just

741
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,610
security when we you're right there are

742
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,309
a lot of other things in fact I teach a

743
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,620
sort of three-day transition course for

744
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,139
incoming first year students it's sort

745
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,699
of to introduce them to college and I

746
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,159
teach it on data privacy and it's not

747
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,500
technical it's you know that picture of

748
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,169
you jumping off the jumping off onto a

749
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,299
pool table in in your fraternity house

750
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:48,279
in the backyard your employer will see

751
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:50,379
this five years from now and enjoy it

752
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:53,289
and you know there's things like this

753
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,360
but I'm struck by the fact that we we

754
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:58,000
live in a time in computer science it's

755
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,600
really interesting and that we can shape

756
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,370
the curriculum but we're still you know

757
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,689
even forget about security thinking

758
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,540
about just computer science what should

759
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,850
be in a CS one course

760
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,260
we're not like math where calculus you

761
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,639
know how to teach calculus you know

762
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,610
what's in a calculus course you know

763
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,070
what the sequence of things will be what

764
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,510
should we put in these courses I'm not

765
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,100
sure we've figured out the technical

766
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:25,260
part that should be in these courses and

767
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:29,679
now we've got this whole other aspect of

768
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,900
of machines that as we've seen influence

769
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:36,340
society in ways that can be completely

770
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:37,870
unintended I don't know how you possibly

771
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,159
manage all of that

772
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,179
especially not in a CS curriculum

773
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,360
comment briefly because that we see got

774
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,800
a line a nice cue this forming so two

775
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,389
things that completely agree as far as

776
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,280
vocational piece the worst thing we can

777
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,630
do is keep our knowledge in this at this

778
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,830
conference that's absolutely worst thing

779
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,380
that we can do so I think we have to

780
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,939
push it down if you will to make sure

781
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,430
it's much more accessible so high school

782
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,720
vocational etc as a matter of fact a lot

783
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,370
of demand that we're seeing a lot of

784
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,200
this shortage and the market is not from

785
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,120
folks necessarily graduating from our

786
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,490
program which we think is great this MSN

787
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,370
cybersecurity but it's really you know

788
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,350
associate degree type folks folks would

789
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,590
what undergraduate reason insecurity or

790
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,120
related fields so completely agree also

791
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,030
agree about the interdisciplinary piece

792
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,790
so tech has had this MS and InfoSec for

793
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,200
about 18 19 years which you know we've

794
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,060
been doing it you know before it was

795
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,100
cool so it was like everybody wants to

796
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,659
do it agree in this but about five years

797
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,520
ago we got really good feedback for my

798
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,470
external boards which is like security

799
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,420
is broader it absolutely is we knew that

800
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,360
but thanks for telling us and they said

801
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,070
do something about it so we we created a

802
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,120
new degree invest in cybersecurity that

803
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,240
actually is inherently interdisciplinary

804
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,179
so it has a policy track energy systems

805
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,830
or CPS track in a traditional InfoSec

806
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,060
track and what's nice is that those

807
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,490
folks actually intermix

808
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,379
in the first two courses and they also

809
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,120
in a mentor and I mean go in in a

810
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,260
practicum as well so I completely agree

811
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,020
it should be should be taught broader

812
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,020
great alright thank you

813
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:10,230
hi Nick Weaver I teach at Berkeley among

814
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,640
other things both the lower division

815
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,650
computer architecture class as well as

816
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,410
the upper division computer security

817
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,290
class

818
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:22,490
one thing that strikes me is how do you

819
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:24,500
teach see so in the computer

820
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,990
architecture class we have to teach

821
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,790
because you have to understand how the

822
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,380
computers work but at the same time I

823
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:35,330
personally when I teach the class make a

824
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,420
point of making sure that students

825
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:43,129
understand that unsafe languages are

826
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:47,150
basically literally ak-47s tied to point

827
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:51,530
at your foot and I have the continual

828
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:53,720
mantra of what does this do undefined

829
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:57,410
behavior get them to realize that

830
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,330
undefined behavior is the root of so

831
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,880
many problems not just security but it's

832
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,720
your bugs it's the heisenbugs it's all

833
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,400
that crap and so I'm wondering if other

834
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,909
people have been trying to make a

835
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,310
systemic effort to get people especially

836
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,730
on C and C++ and the other unsafe

837
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:20,029
languages to understand them to respect

838
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,010
them and to load them with a passion by

839
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,200
the time you're done

840
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:27,020
so one thing we do in our application

841
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,819
security sequence is we have the

842
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,159
students implement something that's

843
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,800
meant to be a fairly simple program in

844
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,149
an unsafe language something like you

845
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,090
know a conversion program that converts

846
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,310
English text to pig latin or you know

847
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,020
does something like that and then we

848
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,610
also give them some kind of glue code

849
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,929
around this so it's part of a module

850
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,750
where they go through and first they

851
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:49,190
build a local app using the like you

852
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,530
know something that would run as just a

853
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,330
normal desktop app using the normal

854
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,919
methodology where we give them out some

855
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,719
of the plumbing around that then they

856
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,730
convert it to a web app and then they

857
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,009
put a database back in and they do cloud

858
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,600
and then they do a mobile part and all

859
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,420
of those pieces we give them a bunch of

860
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,970
plumbing and framework and talk about

861
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,070
and show them instances of where they

862
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,569
have exactly the types of problems that

863
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,460
you're worried about so the in the

864
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,680
issues that you're worried about related

865
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,840
to see we cover and go through and have

866
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,549
given them code and things that will

867
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,470
have those sorts of problems as part of

868
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,000
their framework so they get you know

869
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,410
they may have introduced bugs like this

870
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,050
on their own but they get this really

871
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,940
visceral understanding of why they need

872
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:31,600
to

873
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,460
you know like bounds check operations

874
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,900
and why they need to use safe operations

875
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:40,150
and why they need to not have undefined

876
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:42,190
behavior and so on right well there it's

877
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,650
used a lot of places and at least our

878
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,090
approaches you know we show them how in

879
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,890
that framework they're going to

880
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,630
encounter problems using it in this way

881
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,790
and then as they get to other languages

882
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,290
and frameworks and do things they don't

883
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,090
have to encounter those problems they go

884
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,170
sorts of fun new problems that are

885
00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:01,210
reasons for them not to use other

886
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:03,820
languages as well so one of the things

887
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,190
to speak directly to the uncertainty are

888
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,750
to the undefined one of the things have

889
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,930
done in the past and I teach an

890
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,060
introductory C course is to have the

891
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,049
students implement programs that

892
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,490
specifically call use undefined behavior

893
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,950
and have them rendered on multiple

894
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:24,509
machines what happens in that case is

895
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:28,270
they you know wait what it weren't there

896
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:30,280
and so then they learn hey don't do that

897
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:34,300
and B if you have to do that make sure

898
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,800
you check that the machine your your you

899
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,220
intended for is the one you're actually

900
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:44,020
running on and think things like that

901
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:46,930
and I also I do warn them about types

902
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,150
that type unsafe languages as well but I

903
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,710
agree with Justin that C is used very

904
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,760
very widely particularly in the

905
00:36:50,710 --> 00:37:13,510
communities I work with and so saying

906
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:15,340
don't teach it is wouldn't work what can

907
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,090
I say students tend to use the languages

908
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,370
that they like that

909
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:22,960
they're comfortable with i but if they

910
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,910
certainly learned the difficulties and

911
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,680
the problems in c that aren't for

912
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,750
example inherent in python python has

913
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,600
its own problems so I guess that's about

914
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,640
the best I can say and I also say that

915
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,049
it's very rare that a student going into

916
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,900
a company is going to start their own

917
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,800
new project and not and be able to pick

918
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,960
the language but yeah

919
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:49,470
you know one else want to add something

920
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:51,780
or good morning Luca from 2 and over in

921
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,939
the Netherlands so so far we've been

922
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,280
talking about how to educate people to

923
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,590
build secure software be you know

924
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,500
security aware but we're also building

925
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,420
in a pivotal moment right where the

926
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,480
figure of the actor is being

927
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:11,130
professionalized now so teaching people

928
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,080
how to offend is part also of some of

929
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,630
the security curriculums that some of

930
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,910
our universities want to teach and this

931
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,680
is of course attention with ethical

932
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:22,319
aspects and other things that especially

933
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,600
in engineering schools as opposed to

934
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,980
abort are the humanities course are not

935
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:34,230
you know part of the of the of the

936
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,120
natural interest of the students so

937
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,730
because since to the panel would be how

938
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,100
do you see offensive technologies being

939
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,820
added to computer security curricula in

940
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:48,740
general and how do you think the ethical

941
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:51,660
aspects should be properly addressed I

942
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:54,620
think that there's nothing fundamentally

943
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,109
unethical about offensive technologies

944
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:00,660
there are are a lot of excellent groups

945
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:03,030
that do penetration testing trail of

946
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,589
bits and a lot of their graduates came

947
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:10,890
out of our program and work very closely

948
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:12,450
with us and pen testing even you know we

949
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,859
have classes where we do offensive

950
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,480
security to teach students how to do

951
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,180
penetration testing and do these other

952
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,070
technologies so I think if it's done

953
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,919
right and you show them the right way to

954
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,840
do it and you talk about you know you're

955
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,290
not just gonna go and start trying to

956
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,060
break into every mom-and-pop website

957
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,640
that anybody's set up on the Internet I

958
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,009
think it's an extremely valuable skill

959
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,400
and actually one that a lot of our

960
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,320
graduates get hired to do professionally

961
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:44,070
and I think that in general they help

962
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,710
the internet security greatly by doing

963
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:50,890
so yeah I don't think

964
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:54,040
I mean arguably I would my opinion would

965
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,779
be you can't you can't teach someone how

966
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,370
to defend a system if unless they know

967
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,350
something about how it's going to be

968
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:03,940
attacked this being said I did not enjoy

969
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,759
someone doing one of my students doing a

970
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,410
spoof some years ago a simple one

971
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:15,520
whereby my class received an email from

972
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:17,859
me canceling my final exam yeah I

973
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,150
completely agree I mean I've heard that

974
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,250
you know I've given lots of

975
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,830
presentations in front of our various

976
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,330
advisory boards and and whenever we talk

977
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,770
about doing some sort of offensive stuff

978
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,720
it's like oh my gosh you're teaching

979
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,910
these things and my response is

980
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,439
absolutely yes we are and you cannot

981
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,509
defend if you don't know how to attack

982
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,130
we absolutely have to do this and it's

983
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,540
foolish to think that if we don't teach

984
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,040
it they won't learn it I mean it just

985
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,020
doesn't make sense so this is a great

986
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,550
opportunity for us to teach this but

987
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,080
also bring in an ethics so let's

988
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,910
actually have them learn it the way we

989
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,130
want them to learn it because that's

990
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,859
part of defense now I mean a pentesting

991
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,360
job is a legitimate and very useful job

992
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:56,800
so I think it's really important to

993
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:59,320
consider that yes I'd like to hammer

994
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,330
home on the point of ethics when you

995
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,220
teach this sort of thing you really need

996
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,900
to hammer into the students there are

997
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,600
rules there are things you can do and

998
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,140
there are things you can't do and also

999
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:13,750
make sure you get things in writing also

1000
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:17,440
in terms of teaching of offensive

1001
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:20,350
security I to teach penetration testing

1002
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,150
and such but there's also a flip side to

1003
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:25,600
it namely how would you prevent this

1004
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:28,270
from happening and typically that's done

1005
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,770
with existing systems and then the next

1006
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,810
question is how would you build a system

1007
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,120
where this couldn't happen so in other

1008
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,370
words instead of focusing on defending

1009
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:41,130
the current also try to look ahead and

1010
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:43,540
say well can we build systems where this

1011
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,160
the threat on existing ones is not

1012
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,970
really a threat there because of the way

1013
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,399
we've designed designed it one of my pet

1014
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,930
peeves about capture-the-flag contests

1015
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,120
which I think in general are great are

1016
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,230
that I'd like to see more focus on on

1017
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,569
building and design designing and

1018
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,210
building things that are

1019
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:10,400
your rather than attacking things that

1020
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:10,400
we know aren't pet peeves oh thank you

1021
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:18,630
hi Cynthia Arvin Naval Postgraduate

1022
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,830
School so in my world in tow

1023
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:25,080
well my world started thinking about

1024
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:27,960
computers pretty early but there's a

1025
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,890
definite realization that we have land

1026
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,340
air sea not in the order that they've

1027
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:40,200
been deployed and space and now the

1028
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:41,970
cyber space which is a human artifact so

1029
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,689
starting with that as as sort of where

1030
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,950
I'm coming from

1031
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:49,380
I have two questions one is our

1032
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,960
technology is still accelerating and

1033
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,600
moving forward very quickly and there is

1034
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,380
increasing automation and that includes

1035
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,290
automation of IT functions that may

1036
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,680
involve security where the human is

1037
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:07,110
maybe outside of the loop and looking in

1038
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,759
to make some final decisions and

1039
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:15,260
configure things and of the generation

1040
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:19,200
of software from specifications by

1041
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,690
artificial means and how is that this is

1042
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,490
question number one how should our

1043
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:29,750
education enterprise prepare for these

1044
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:31,799
changes which are in fact on their way

1045
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,450
there are people who are predicting that

1046
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,060
they're not going to be as many people

1047
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:38,430
writing software that the computers are

1048
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,070
going to be writing software so how do

1049
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:43,020
we change our computer science programs

1050
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,340
to deal with that and well let you

1051
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,670
answer that and then ask the second

1052
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,670
question

1053
00:43:53,079 --> 00:44:01,430
um I'll take a shot at it

1054
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:03,560
the first thing is the automation while

1055
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,589
I think it's great also concerns me a

1056
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,450
bit because when the computer says

1057
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:10,700
something people see it typically as

1058
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,960
infallible what happens if the

1059
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,549
specifications from which you're

1060
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,369
building the program aren't the ones

1061
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,630
aren't the correct ones so I think there

1062
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:22,760
needs to be a human in the loop

1063
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:25,130
somewhere that said the if as the

1064
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,950
ability the programs and such shall

1065
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,770
automate the development of software at

1066
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:34,098
least in my world I haven't seen much of

1067
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:35,720
that and as we see more I expect we'll

1068
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:38,859
start integrating it into the courses

1069
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,598
but I'd also like to make the point that

1070
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:43,700
even if something is automated people

1071
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,960
still need to understand the people who

1072
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,990
are working with it should still

1073
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,839
understand how it works not so much

1074
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:54,319
necessarily how the things are generated

1075
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:56,810
but the end the end result they need to

1076
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,920
know where the flaws might be they need

1077
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,720
to know how to come up with the

1078
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,000
requirements and so forth so they can

1079
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,169
build the specifications and maintain

1080
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,290
the tools that translate the

1081
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:10,369
specifications into code and do the

1082
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:12,619
testing that's appropriate how do you so

1083
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:14,390
I'm not sure how I would integrate that

1084
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:16,520
into the program probably the students

1085
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,319
the students at first would love it

1086
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,030
because they wouldn't have to write they

1087
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,740
wouldn't write much code in my security

1088
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,540
class then they'd hate it because

1089
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,290
they've have to write specifications

1090
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,839
which means they'd have to learn a

1091
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:29,000
specification language which probably

1092
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:36,230
they would not enjoy at least not at the

1093
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:40,010
beginning but there are people who don't

1094
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:42,260
understand how some ml applications are

1095
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:48,079
actually doing what they're doing so how

1096
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:49,849
it works so so this was as as Matt was

1097
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,160
answering I was thinking just this that

1098
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:55,490
of course there's this argument in ml of

1099
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,149
understanding how certain models do come

1100
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:01,939
to the decisions they do so so if you if

1101
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,710
you believe that in the future software

1102
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,540
is going to be creating software or

1103
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,950
we're going to be artificially creating

1104
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,170
software

1105
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,730
I imagine that curriculums would our

1106
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:14,300
curricula would have to change so that

1107
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:16,760
you would start by educating or at least

1108
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,839
educating as a part of your curriculum

1109
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,490
that students understand how these

1110
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:23,839
models are making their decisions how

1111
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,790
they're deciding what software to write

1112
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,500
what are the ramifications of this I

1113
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,170
don't think we know the answers to that

1114
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,890
yet but I also agree with Matt that I

1115
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:35,240
don't think that you're ever going to oh

1116
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,650
I'll back up a second we have

1117
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,479
Mathematica that does a lot of things

1118
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:41,420
that doesn't mean you don't need people

1119
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,790
who understand how calculus works so

1120
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,520
will will I think there'll always be a

1121
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,890
need for software development experts

1122
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,200
even if software is writing more

1123
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,089
software yeah and I just want to

1124
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,189
piggyback one more thing onto this is

1125
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:58,670
that you can also view the fact that we

1126
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:01,099
use under high like languages that are

1127
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:03,109
not assembly and the fact that we use

1128
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:05,510
libraries and things like this as the

1129
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:07,940
fact that we as programmers have already

1130
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:10,460
been automating away a lot of the

1131
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,460
mundane tasks that happened here and so

1132
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,619
I would be quite skeptical because

1133
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,300
there's a lot of ambiguity left in what

1134
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,640
people are doing things that you can

1135
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,890
optimize away better languages better

1136
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,900
frameworks you know Ruby on Rails and

1137
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:27,170
things like that come along and automate

1138
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,640
away a lot of the boring you know parts

1139
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:31,430
that could have been automated by a

1140
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:35,060
machine so there's going to be things in

1141
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,290
the limit there and I am not at all

1142
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:41,170
worried about my students not having

1143
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:44,960
jobs for that in this part of the world

1144
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,300
my second question has to do with the

1145
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,480
larger community there's been a little

1146
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,730
bit of touching on k-12 but since we're

1147
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,220
dealing in a world where there is

1148
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:59,349
essentially a different dimension a

1149
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:02,990
human created dimension where is our

1150
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:05,990
Neil deGrasse Tyson person who is

1151
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:11,290
explaining this to the public so that

1152
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:14,720
they understand how cyber security and

1153
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,630
these these automated systems are going

1154
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,319
to affect

1155
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,690
them and and so that there is a

1156
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:25,380
internalization of the importance of

1157
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:29,100
getting these things better so that you

1158
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:31,850
don't eat tainted software we try not to

1159
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:37,110
eat tainted food and drink bad water

1160
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:38,759
yeah so I'll start with this one so I

1161
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:42,390
think there are a lot of us that do this

1162
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:49,470
kind of outreach so Nick Weaver who asks

1163
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:51,390
a question no no no but you know so yeah

1164
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,339
maybe maybe we haven't had that

1165
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,839
charismatic person come along but there

1166
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,320
are a lot of us that have been doing

1167
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:00,330
this outreach I see Nick mentioned all

1168
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,840
the time in various publications I've

1169
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:05,610
been on television like 60 70 times and

1170
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,780
given hundreds of interviews about

1171
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,970
different things related to

1172
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,130
cybersecurity for different venues so

1173
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:16,370
there are a lot of us that value and do

1174
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:21,090
work in that area but you know hey and

1175
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:23,009
yeah I would just say that it would be

1176
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,840
nice to have someone like that come

1177
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:27,510
along so if you know anyone at like The

1178
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,180
Late Show with Stephen Colbert and you

1179
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:31,200
know can get a booking then I think

1180
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,669
there's a lot of people from our

1181
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,859
community that you could recommend that

1182
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:41,460
are already doing that kind of public

1183
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:43,800
outreach basically until that gel and

1184
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,650
inter-gender woman gentle woman coming

1185
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:50,070
along all we can do with small

1186
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,350
incremental steps for example with

1187
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,160
electronic voting in the when it first

1188
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,190
came out

1189
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,750
anybody who opposed it was a lot because

1190
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,700
of course the computers are gonna be

1191
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,790
accurate and we're of election officials

1192
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,620
we know how to run an election that

1193
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:06,360
mindset has slowly changed in many many

1194
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,609
parts of the country due to the work

1195
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,890
that people have done not just the

1196
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:13,830
technical work of showing the problems

1197
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:15,569
but also showing the convincing the

1198
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,710
election officials look we're not after

1199
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,510
your jobs we're not saying you're

1200
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:21,480
incompetent this is just an area that

1201
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,560
everybody needs to learn a little more

1202
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,820
about it you need to learn the

1203
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,860
technology we need to learn how

1204
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,800
elections work and now with the

1205
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:30,980
exception of a few states

1206
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,510
most election officials happily accept

1207
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:36,200
the help of technical people and in many

1208
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:39,140
cases encourage it so small steps until

1209
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,529
this person comes along and I hope the

1210
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,359
person comes along soon so actually I

1211
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,650
would I would I like the question and I

1212
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,840
think it's a really good one I think we

1213
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,180
need that that individual I would even

1214
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,770
go a little bit more junior and ass like

1215
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,149
where's our Smokey the Bear and I'm

1216
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,620
dating myself a bit half of y'all don't

1217
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,410
know what the heck I'm talking about but

1218
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,420
it's it's it's it's you know and that's

1219
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,890
something that we all know it's just you

1220
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,630
know this campaign that you grew up on

1221
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,060
and you appreciate it exactly what the

1222
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,830
message was so it's even from five years

1223
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,150
five years old or four years old we

1224
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,069
should be talking about these things and

1225
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,560
reinforcing them from a public

1226
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,790
perspective just three days ago my 12

1227
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,340
year old daughter sent me a screenshot

1228
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:17,259
hey daddy this popped up on my iPhone

1229
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,430
what should I do

1230
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,750
don't click on it was when I was in the

1231
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,430
middle of meeting don't click on it

1232
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,650
whatever it is and we'll talk about it

1233
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:28,549
later but she didn't know what to do

1234
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:29,810
with that I know I'm excited about now I

1235
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:39,620
don't know she clicked on the first and

1236
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:41,630
then told me but good morning this is

1237
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,700
Ashish Kundu I am from head of cyber

1238
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:46,880
security at new dot AI we make

1239
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,620
autonomous cars I was at IBM TJ Watson

1240
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,030
mrs. hunter before that so I have couple

1241
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:53,560
of questions from both of these

1242
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:57,830
experiences one is about when we

1243
00:51:53,560 --> 00:52:01,610
interview people you know what I found

1244
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:05,380
even from PhDs from top schools top CS

1245
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:08,810
programs in US and UK and other places

1246
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:11,750
there is a gap in their understanding

1247
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:14,270
about security it's important to

1248
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:16,400
understand holistic security because the

1249
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,530
weakest link is important to know and

1250
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,230
people who come out from top programs

1251
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:25,310
which great publications still have that

1252
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:27,770
issue and I like distinguished

1253
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:32,180
professors like you with Matt they're

1254
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:34,640
also too to see how it should address

1255
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:38,299
that and I'll come back with my second

1256
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,509
question okay I guess I'll kick this off

1257
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,699
so I think if you want people

1258
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:46,399
have really good security awareness and

1259
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:48,289
things like this you're probably hiring

1260
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:52,609
in the wrong place for the most part if

1261
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:54,229
you're looking for PhDs I think most

1262
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:57,049
students that come out with the PhD

1263
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:59,808
become very specialized in a sub niche

1264
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:02,449
that's not interesting to anyone in the

1265
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:04,519
world other than the eight academics who

1266
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:07,039
review the papers that all publish each

1267
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:10,848
other's work just to be totally honest

1268
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:13,339
here and and by the way I did a I did a

1269
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:15,559
survey a little while ago that I sent to

1270
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:17,808
a bunch of professors in academia and

1271
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,759
also to a bunch of folks in industry

1272
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:22,189
asking them very basic questions like

1273
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:23,659
you know like four choices like what is

1274
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:26,779
multix which one of these four is that

1275
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:28,999
an operating system is a name of a band

1276
00:53:26,779 --> 00:53:31,339
it's at whatever and the same with

1277
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:33,109
questions about like at CD and sto and

1278
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:37,159
other highly relevant industry

1279
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:38,389
technologies and the academics did very

1280
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:40,999
badly on the industry relevant

1281
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:42,679
technologies and the industry people did

1282
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:46,249
very you know there's this huge

1283
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:48,649
difference here so I think especially

1284
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:50,839
and by the way the effect was much more

1285
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:53,538
pronounced as people became professors

1286
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:54,919
and had spent more time in academia they

1287
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:58,309
knew less and less about what was

1288
00:53:54,919 --> 00:54:02,299
actually relevant in industry so there's

1289
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:04,759
a big gap here and and this by the way I

1290
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:06,380
think is a big problem so if anyone's

1291
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:08,149
interested in reading this post seeing

1292
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,939
all the data and stuff like that you can

1293
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:13,519
type NYU space SSL that'll take you to

1294
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:15,919
my my lab site and you can click on the

1295
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,359
blog there and the top post there talks

1296
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:20,598
about it and has the data linked and

1297
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:22,219
everything else like that so I think the

1298
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:24,079
right place for you to hire for the

1299
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:26,599
things that you want is actually usually

1300
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,130
out of the master's programs the

1301
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:32,329
students there will have done things

1302
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:34,699
like done industry relevant internships

1303
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:44,479
and will know more about technology than

1304
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:49,219
the PhD students usually well my last

1305
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:52,368
question is about kids so when I was at

1306
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:53,710
IBM research I got to talk to the boy

1307
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:57,400
scout program

1308
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:59,080
and about security and privacy and what

1309
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,300
they came out dilash the questions

1310
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:04,000
archer how how do can you teach us how

1311
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:08,460
to break into a system you know so so

1312
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,650
the question is when we teach security

1313
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:14,050
should we start with an it's a threat

1314
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:17,349
mindset or attack our mindset or from a

1315
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:20,560
different mindset yeah so sorry do you

1316
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:22,420
want to do okay so I I love to when

1317
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,619
especially when I teach people at that

1318
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,300
level I'd love to take a lot of

1319
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:28,030
real-world examples and talk about

1320
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:31,390
things like Bank of America has to keep

1321
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:33,099
the change program where you know if you

1322
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,020
if you go and you spend five dollars and

1323
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:36,640
twenty three cents then they round that

1324
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,440
up to six dollars and they put the extra

1325
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,810
money they charge you into your savings

1326
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,540
account but for the first three months

1327
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:45,040
they don't actually around like charge

1328
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,009
you the six dollars they just put the

1329
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,410
extra change in so what could you do to

1330
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:52,780
exploit this like and and you know then

1331
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:55,330
there was this guy who apparently pumped

1332
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,859
a Penny's worth of gas like for ten

1333
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,299
thousand made ten thousand dollars or

1334
00:55:56,859 --> 00:56:00,339
something out of this and so we had a

1335
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,599
big discussion about that and then also

1336
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:04,119
talked about things like who actually

1337
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,310
who actually really was on the hook for

1338
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:07,869
the bill who paid the most money out it

1339
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:09,460
turns out it wasn't Bank of America it

1340
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,720
was the gas station that had to pay all

1341
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,760
the fees for all the credit card

1342
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,649
transactions there's a lot of little

1343
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,440
things like that that you I think can

1344
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:19,119
walk people through and I have dozens

1345
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,410
and dozens of real-world scenarios as we

1346
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,780
go through we play this game what could

1347
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,460
possibly go wrong where we talk about

1348
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,050
you know all this kind of stuff and I

1349
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,240
think that helps to get people engaged

1350
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,099
and gets them to think from a different

1351
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,560
perspective you don't want them just to

1352
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:33,790
have a defensive perspective or just how

1353
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,779
is this used but how could someone

1354
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:39,339
misuse it so yeah one of the things I do

1355
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:42,040
it at the beginning of each of my

1356
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:45,779
security classes is post some sort of a

1357
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,710
problem and very often it's not it's

1358
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,800
here's what happened

1359
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,430
here's what they did was what was what

1360
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,530
they did

1361
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,000
ethical how would you have done it what

1362
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,619
was wrong with what they did what was

1363
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,550
right with what they did and so forth

1364
00:56:56,619 --> 00:57:02,650
and that tends to get the students into

1365
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,839
the right mindset of how do we look at

1366
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,099
things but it also tends to get them

1367
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,390
into the mindset of asking questions

1368
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:09,100
about

1369
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:12,759
is this something I should be doing and

1370
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:15,759
so forth this I started doing this

1371
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:18,250
because I was in a discussion group in

1372
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,380
another class and one of the students

1373
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,090
asked well gee if people can break into

1374
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,730
banks so easily why don't you write your

1375
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:27,940
meeting there and I had to explain that

1376
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:29,530
look if a let's not get into the

1377
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,150
technical let's just look at them let's

1378
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,960
just look at the ethical dimension of it

1379
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:36,010
that money's gonna come from somewhere

1380
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,200
ethically would you steal the money from

1381
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,900
this person no okay then why would you

1382
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,819
do it this way like that try to get them

1383
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,030
to think as justice said think through

1384
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,170
the consequences of the actions yes so

1385
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,360
when you when you mentioned the Boy

1386
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:52,060
Scouts I'm thinking relatively younger

1387
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:55,200
kids and I and I can understand having

1388
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:59,320
been one many many years ago that that

1389
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:02,230
there might be this glamorization of oh

1390
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,790
I can I can break into computers I think

1391
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,080
you really wanted at that age it's

1392
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,259
really nice it's great that they're

1393
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:10,750
interested in computers but telling them

1394
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,830
these are the consequences of of this

1395
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:15,160
kind of thing I'm not sure that

1396
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:17,770
registers at that age I might point out

1397
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,890
okay so that video game you like to play

1398
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:23,470
it's gone again I removed it from your

1399
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,850
computer and and and it points oh so it

1400
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:26,680
actually hits home because I think for a

1401
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:28,630
lot of people computer security doesn't

1402
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,649
really hit home until they've been hit

1403
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:35,050
and especially for kids to see hey you

1404
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,810
know it's it's it's glamorous to do this

1405
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,150
except that someone just stole these

1406
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:43,480
files off my computers so maybe maybe

1407
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:45,550
it's not so glamorous to do this one

1408
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:49,120
quick comment on the consequence is that

1409
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:51,670
I tend to talk about are legal ones for

1410
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:54,009
example where the Cuckoo's egg is a good

1411
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:56,170
example you're into shorts is another

1412
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:58,390
very good example things like that so

1413
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:00,310
the students understand that gee it's

1414
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:02,680
not this professor telling us not to do

1415
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:06,070
this and it will help we won't pass this

1416
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:09,220
class if we do it's wow there are really

1417
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:15,330
nasty things can happen thank you so

1418
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:18,529
much i steve Lipner from safe code

1419
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:23,060
there's an old old story

1420
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:24,710
when back back 2,000 or so I had the

1421
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,740
misfortune of running the security

1422
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:29,720
response team at Microsoft which was the

1423
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:32,240
organization that dealt with externally

1424
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:36,020
reported vulnerabilities and we had just

1425
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,810
hired ramped up our staff some just

1426
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,790
hired internally a new program manager

1427
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,860
to be a case manager basically take

1428
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:44,860
reports from people who found

1429
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:48,560
vulnerabilities and and drive them to

1430
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:52,120
resolution and solution good guy well

1431
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:54,440
rated not a security person quote

1432
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,720
somebody we had hired out of the program

1433
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,510
management team in the support

1434
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,480
organization and I remember still

1435
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:06,500
bringing him you know his first case

1436
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,870
which was surely some buffer overrun in

1437
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,120
something and and showing him this

1438
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:14,480
report and the repro from the finder and

1439
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:20,630
his response was why would anybody do

1440
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:25,190
that tell them not to do that and so you

1441
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:27,440
know I you know sort of my my appeal you

1442
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:29,240
know my I'm not you know it's 20 years

1443
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,670
ago maybe things have changed I'm not

1444
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,250
convinced I've changed my appeal is sort

1445
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:37,100
of right raise the bar so somebody who

1446
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:41,390
comes out of a computer science program

1447
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:43,759
at least knows the concept that you know

1448
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:45,980
a mistake in software can you know

1449
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,580
somebody might actually do that and bad

1450
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,890
stuff can happen that this is

1451
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:55,490
unfortunately still common today I've

1452
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:57,500
been on security panels with people like

1453
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,330
a medical device conferences or

1454
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:02,090
automotive conferences or other areas

1455
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:05,660
like that and had people say security is

1456
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:08,480
just the same as safety right and it

1457
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:11,120
really isn't because with security you

1458
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,640
have an intentional adversary that's

1459
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,190
trying to go and will manipulate inputs

1460
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,660
in whatever way they want whereas you

1461
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,730
know I've had I've literally heard

1462
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:21,799
people say you could just put CRC's or

1463
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,270
other checks like this and and them

1464
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,120
treating this as an integrity thing

1465
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:27,740
because what's the chance that you know

1466
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,900
the bit string is randomly going to be

1467
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,399
something that causes problems so there

1468
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,010
is a lot of Education that needs to

1469
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,380
happen as

1470
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:36,750
especially outside of the core I mean

1471
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,670
tech finance and even I've seen a big

1472
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,990
change in automotive with the five or so

1473
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,150
years have been working closely with the

1474
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:44,540
automakers in there but there are a lot

1475
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:47,880
of domains that still need a lot of help

1476
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:49,529
we really really important for the

1477
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,520
technical population to at least

1478
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:56,820
understand that basic I'll make a

1479
01:01:53,520 --> 01:02:00,210
general comment that I think so

1480
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,860
computing is getting so broad and and

1481
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,690
even secured itself is it's getting

1482
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:07,320
really broad and that it's going to be

1483
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,970
hard if we really accept like where this

1484
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,430
is going sort of follow it to its

1485
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:14,100
natural conclusion it's gonna be hard to

1486
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:15,379
for any of us to agree what students

1487
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,509
should know when they get their degree

1488
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:21,090
because there's just so many things it's

1489
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,490
just a few years we won't this community

1490
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:26,190
won't be a degree on that so what I

1491
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,810
think will need to happen is we're gonna

1492
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,910
have to be more flexible with our

1493
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,799
curricula in general so we're gonna have

1494
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,930
to start doing things like one credit

1495
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,020
hour short courses right there that you

1496
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:38,810
add on to whatever else you're taking

1497
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,070
we're gonna have to start accepting that

1498
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:42,750
just because you got a degree does not

1499
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,830
mean that you're done and and one of the

1500
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,690
things and it's sort of a plug

1501
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:47,190
protecting that we are trying to have

1502
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:49,290
lifetime learners and that's essentially

1503
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:51,540
you graduate but you never leave and we

1504
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:53,759
essentially provide education as a

1505
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,750
service so I think ultimately we're

1506
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,020
gonna get to a point where you're gonna

1507
01:02:54,750 --> 01:03:00,300
get 80% of the stuff that we can

1508
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,880
probably agree on with a degree and you

1509
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,350
graduate and then you take a month off

1510
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,810
and then you're back in this course

1511
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:12,230
learning about software automation or

1512
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:12,230
whatever this next thing is thank you

1513
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:23,700
and I'm asking this question I see

1514
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:26,250
software that was just starting to think

1515
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,899
about security and I would just like to

1516
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,720
take away from here and would like to

1517
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:33,270
know I I heard you give an advice to

1518
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,939
instructors to their students so hey

1519
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:38,430
think about security when coding but I

1520
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:42,450
mean that's not precise for me so I

1521
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:44,220
would like just some few yeah advice on

1522
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:46,669
where to start to think about security

1523
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,669
when

1524
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:56,510
I'll give this one a shot it's a tough

1525
01:03:51,780 --> 01:04:01,130
question is um as Richard pointed out

1526
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:04,100
what it would I would suggest is first

1527
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:06,450
asking yourself what can go wrong

1528
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:10,380
because that will get you into the

1529
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:13,500
mindset of looking for bugs or problems

1530
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,240
in your code that exist and that can

1531
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:20,100
look that could cause problems for

1532
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:22,560
others and once you've done that then

1533
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:25,110
you can begin to figure out okay

1534
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:29,759
what area I might have what areas should

1535
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:32,070
I look let's surely look at also don't

1536
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,110
think of it so much as what can go wrong

1537
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:36,270
with this program think of how the

1538
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:38,370
program is going to be used and ask the

1539
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:40,230
question in that environment during that

1540
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:42,210
and that way of thinking because

1541
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:44,040
security isn't really a property of a

1542
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:47,550
program or a machine it's a property of

1543
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:50,460
program machine environment procedures

1544
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:52,020
and so forth and all too often we focus

1545
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,410
on the machine to the exclusion or

1546
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:59,060
program to the exclusion of other things

1547
01:04:54,410 --> 01:05:02,759
but basically the adversarial mindset

1548
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:06,180
thinking adversarial mindset imply

1549
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,980
someone's out to get you and whether or

1550
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,600
not they're out to get you I think about

1551
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:13,290
what can go wrong that's that's where I

1552
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,930
would begin I'll even give a slightly

1553
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:18,150
more concrete suggestion so what's the

1554
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:20,730
first program that you might learn in a

1555
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:24,300
language it's probably hello world right

1556
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:25,920
if you think about that in C so it's

1557
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,850
printf hello world

1558
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,320
what does printf return it in its

1559
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:36,779
function signature it's not a void

1560
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:38,640
function it returns an integer so printf

1561
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,200
returns to status like an error code

1562
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,370
that tells you whether it succeeded or

1563
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,870
failed well why does printf do that

1564
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:49,049
could you make could you make it so that

1565
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:50,370
you you take the printf example code can

1566
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:54,180
you find a way to make it so it doesn't

1567
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:55,920
actually print hello world like how like

1568
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:58,169
what situations would need to happen for

1569
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,800
that to happen so kind of starting that

1570
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,570
explore

1571
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:03,360
even on that very dumb example I gave

1572
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:05,190
you or taking and doing that with you

1573
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,650
know more complicated programs because

1574
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:09,720
security is really all down in the weird

1575
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:13,140
edge cases how do I make this really

1576
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:15,870
weird edge case happen so find some some

1577
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:17,490
case that interests you and try to

1578
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:19,170
figure out how do I make weird edge

1579
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:21,299
cases happen and who knows maybe you'll

1580
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:25,280
be giving a black hat talk you know in

1581
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,280
talking about the cool thing you found

1582
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,910
so one of the other things I always

1583
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:34,259
think about which follows on what was

1584
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:36,120
just said is think about what you know

1585
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:38,730
if you're talking about you yourself how

1586
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,080
can i code more securely think about

1587
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:44,360
what assumptions you're making when you

1588
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:47,850
write your code I'm writing a function I

1589
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:50,700
expect this input what am i assuming is

1590
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:53,670
going to happen what what kind of input

1591
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,839
am i assuming I'm going to get and so

1592
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:57,030
your input you're building these

1593
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,800
implicit trust models I'm trusting that

1594
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:01,050
this is what my code is going to get and

1595
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,150
I'm writing my code accordingly in your

1596
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,830
code might not get that and so a lot of

1597
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:06,060
the vulnerabilities we see we talked

1598
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:08,279
about edge cases and it's also about

1599
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:11,040
trust models when the programmer wrote

1600
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,240
this what did they expect they were

1601
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,390
going to see what were they trusting

1602
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:17,819
implicitly and how can I violate that

1603
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:19,020
and potentially change the code so

1604
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,220
that's what you want to think when

1605
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,230
you're right and one of the things you

1606
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,580
can think is if I get an input that's

1607
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:27,750
different than what I expected

1608
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:33,660
as with the format string bug what's

1609
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:36,720
going to what can the consequences be a

1610
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:37,980
good example also is race conditions

1611
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,359
there you're interacting with the

1612
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:41,820
operating system and you're making

1613
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,010
certain assumptions about the order in

1614
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:45,480
which things will occur well what

1615
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,830
happens if the order occurred what

1616
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,410
happens if they occur in the in a

1617
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:51,120
different order or what happens is

1618
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:53,970
someone tinker's with the environment so

1619
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,270
it's not what you expect so it's a good

1620
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,270
example

1621
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:07,890
hello i'm lashonna Baskar from UC san

1622
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:11,519
diego and so we I guess we had a lot of

1623
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:13,319
discussion about how to like a security

1624
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,988
education in computer science and for

1625
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:17,790
computer science majors but what I was

1626
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:21,679
wondering was what a opinions are on for

1627
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:26,460
like like other areas in which

1628
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:30,029
inadvertently people have just forget

1629
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:34,109
about security so I give an example in

1630
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:38,909
the sense that embedded systems so or

1631
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:40,770
IOT security is well you know a big

1632
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:42,598
problem and one of the things that

1633
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:45,000
happens is what I've seen I was an

1634
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:48,509
embedded systems developer I was an

1635
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,089
electrical engineer I did a basic C

1636
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:52,560
programming course in my undergrad and

1637
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:55,469
that wasn't enough I was never

1638
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,949
introduced to security I develop systems

1639
01:08:55,469 --> 01:09:00,239
at do you in companies for about three

1640
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:02,669
years before coming to grad school and

1641
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,009
realizing oh my god that I didn't even

1642
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:09,239
know at that point initially what a

1643
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:10,920
public or a private key was and so my

1644
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:12,809
question is like and there are these

1645
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,149
people and mostly I'm talking with the

1646
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:16,889
firmware developers who are in mostly

1647
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:18,689
our electrical engineers or at most like

1648
01:09:16,889 --> 01:09:20,909
computer engineers but not computer

1649
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:24,000
scientists and computer science grads

1650
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:26,328
and then they are developing a tons of

1651
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,849
these systems so how do we spread

1652
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:33,568
security education in other these

1653
01:09:29,849 --> 01:09:35,520
adjacent domains so I've been doing a

1654
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:37,230
lot of work with especially the

1655
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,060
automotive industry over quite a few

1656
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:42,540
years so one of the things that I did is

1657
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:44,609
I have created a secure over the update

1658
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:46,139
standard that in three to four years

1659
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:48,810
will be used and about a third of the

1660
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:50,969
new cars coming out in the u.s. through

1661
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:57,719
a lot of integrations into major OEMs

1662
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:59,699
and the reason why we did that work and

1663
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:01,500
did the things with that is because the

1664
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:03,449
systems that were being designed by

1665
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,520
folks in that space were really

1666
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,400
deficient in terms of security and

1667
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,659
basically I don't want people to die

1668
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:13,558
from attacks on their cars

1669
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:15,959
right so what it took to really work

1670
01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:17,880
with those people is to have very clear

1671
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:21,300
very detailed specification of how

1672
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:23,010
things go because what you have is you

1673
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,039
have a lot of programmers that can

1674
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:29,309
implement a spec but can't reason

1675
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:32,159
through like why the things happen so to

1676
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:33,300
think of an another example there are a

1677
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,419
whole lot of programmers that could

1678
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:39,059
implement like tls/ssl they could do

1679
01:10:36,419 --> 01:10:40,619
that right but there are not very many

1680
01:10:39,059 --> 01:10:43,260
programmers that could have come up with

1681
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:45,688
the design of tls/ssl or one that's

1682
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,820
equivalent equivalently secure if they

1683
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:49,800
were left to their own devices so that's

1684
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:52,018
I think part of it another aspect that's

1685
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,400
also really taken hold in those

1686
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:55,439
communities is there's a lot of

1687
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,009
different ways in which they have to

1688
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,510
test and certify in standardized code

1689
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:02,340
and a lot of those development processes

1690
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:04,709
have also come a long way so that the

1691
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:06,269
normal code that isn't things that

1692
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:08,159
people have thought to standardized as

1693
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:10,019
security relevant is getting

1694
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:13,619
increasingly tested in many of these

1695
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:14,849
domains so I think things are moving the

1696
01:11:13,619 --> 01:11:17,969
right direction and those are a couple

1697
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:19,530
ways and if any researcher any person in

1698
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:21,599
this room is interested in working with

1699
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:24,090
these communities which is a lot of work

1700
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:25,979
and it's not going to be a USENIX

1701
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,119
security paper every year sort of or

1702
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:30,989
thing but it's going to be very

1703
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:32,969
rewarding I'm I'm more than happy to put

1704
01:11:30,989 --> 01:11:35,159
you in touch with people I know and help

1705
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:38,610
to get you started these are good

1706
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:39,959
communities to work with once you you

1707
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:42,058
know you you have to work with them a

1708
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:44,669
bit because you are the the idiot who

1709
01:11:42,059 --> 01:11:46,800
doesn't know anything about cars who's

1710
01:11:44,669 --> 01:11:48,059
coming in and you need to spend some

1711
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,189
time learning about that or medical

1712
01:11:48,059 --> 01:11:52,169
devices or things but once once you're

1713
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:53,550
in accepted in the community then

1714
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:59,309
they're very grateful and very nice

1715
01:11:53,550 --> 01:12:01,349
folks because that's an interesting

1716
01:11:59,309 --> 01:12:04,590
point you raised about like specifically

1717
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:07,709
about automotive industry right and and

1718
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:09,090
I guess one thing that I see is the

1719
01:12:07,709 --> 01:12:10,769
thing that I'm concerned about is these

1720
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:12,809
wide variety of like IOT devices

1721
01:12:10,769 --> 01:12:15,900
automotive is great because they have

1722
01:12:12,809 --> 01:12:17,489
very strong regulations and they have to

1723
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,909
pass through certifications and so

1724
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:22,940
security auditing is something like if

1725
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:25,370
they're doing a bad job they will

1726
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:27,739
our past certification but they're these

1727
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:30,739
so many of these are no your fitbit's

1728
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:33,320
and whatnot or home automation and tons

1729
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:35,209
of IOT devices and that those are the

1730
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,759
communities in which so many developers

1731
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:40,400
are in which so do you think that's more

1732
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,290
about the regulation side or I think

1733
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,000
something probably from the regulation

1734
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:47,000
side has to change there personally

1735
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,270
because I market forces you know if you

1736
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,860
get your thing used first first to

1737
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:54,980
market is so important and things like

1738
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:57,920
that are so important other areas like

1739
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:59,809
the power grid and healthcare and

1740
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,600
automotive that are much more regulated

1741
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:03,920
I think there are other forces in play

1742
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,719
here and they know they're gonna build

1743
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:11,530
things but I think you know IOT is just

1744
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:13,880
consumer IOT is just a horrible mess so

1745
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:16,340
yeah I don't know what will ever make

1746
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,870
that better I mean one approach if I

1747
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,760
were really going to dig in and try to

1748
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:22,849
do this is I would try to make

1749
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:25,730
frameworks I would work with people in

1750
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:27,350
the IOT space build systems with them

1751
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:29,360
and understand how to build a framework

1752
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:31,790
that was better and easier for them to

1753
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,380
use than what they're currently doing so

1754
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:36,320
if you imagine you know Ruby on Rails

1755
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:38,570
for for IOT devices and if you build

1756
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,299
that and it has security built in then

1757
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:46,090
they'll use it but other than that I

1758
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:50,180
don't see any way to to get to it yeah

1759
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:51,830
it's I'm actually from the ECE school we

1760
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:53,150
don't have department well actually do

1761
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,739
have one department but we don't have

1762
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:58,549
lots of departments we have schools to

1763
01:13:54,739 --> 01:14:01,250
confuse people at Georgia Tech so it's

1764
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:05,390
it's our students certainly get C as the

1765
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:07,070
programming language and it's I mean

1766
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:08,660
your point is a very valid point because

1767
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:10,130
these are the folks that are that that

1768
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:11,750
are that are really close to the bare

1769
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:14,480
metal that are doing firmware and all

1770
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:17,989
this and and the challenge is

1771
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,910
significant because you know ideally you

1772
01:14:17,989 --> 01:14:21,320
want to say well you have to require

1773
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:23,330
your security course I think you should

1774
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,670
well well yeah but my power systems

1775
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:28,580
colleague thinks that their course is

1776
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:32,780
way more important than security or at

1777
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:35,480
Tech where DSP is like amazing do I pull

1778
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:36,440
out DSP to put in security right so just

1779
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,759
think about that

1780
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:39,199
and then okay well solution would be

1781
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,670
well why don't we just increase the

1782
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,650
number of credit hours for the degree

1783
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:44,930
well no you can't do that right because

1784
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:46,250
our legislature legislature is not going

1785
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,980
to allow us to do so you have all these

1786
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:51,170
really interesting tensions when we have

1787
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:54,049
this problem and I think what ultimately

1788
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:56,989
we're gonna have to do is I think we're

1789
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:58,969
just gonna have to do at least for the

1790
01:14:56,989 --> 01:15:00,290
time being do more and and it's really

1791
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:03,410
back to my point so you mentioned that

1792
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:05,480
you didn't have didn't understand public

1793
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:08,269
private key security right a few if

1794
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,860
there was a nugget if we had you know a

1795
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:12,170
standard security course is broken up

1796
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:13,940
into 30 different nuggets I mean you

1797
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:16,310
could get that but whatever you need

1798
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:18,559
specifically online or whatever it is

1799
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:20,090
for your job but I think we're gonna

1800
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,350
have to meet people where they are and

1801
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:23,719
not assume that they're gonna be able to

1802
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,790
take this long so expansive security

1803
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:27,530
course which I love but you don't need

1804
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:29,540
to understand protocols network

1805
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:35,239
protocols for example to understand

1806
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:37,360
public private key security yes sir to

1807
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,379
follow up a little bit on so that was a

1808
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,880
really good description of the problems

1809
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:42,800
of educating people to do this but as

1810
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,590
far as you're asking about IOT security

1811
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:49,130
and comparing it to airline where we're

1812
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:50,660
a reactive society and unfortunately I

1813
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:52,310
think what's going to happen is that as

1814
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,620
more of these devices show up in homes

1815
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:55,969
and bad things happen then you're going

1816
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:57,680
to see the regulations that Justin

1817
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:59,449
mentioned coming into place and then

1818
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,360
we'll have no choice but to figure out

1819
01:15:59,449 --> 01:16:06,080
how to build these to avoid certain

1820
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:09,980
problems provided that when these

1821
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:13,820
problems occur the causes are made

1822
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:17,150
public and they're and the regulations

1823
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:19,370
or specifications are written properly I

1824
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:22,099
would point out that every electronic

1825
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:25,460
voting machine is certified in one way

1826
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,840
or another and the rules under which

1827
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,300
they're certified are completely

1828
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:32,210
inadequate so in addition to teaching

1829
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:33,290
code you need to teach what is need to

1830
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:37,460
look at the environment the broader

1831
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:40,400
picture you're not describing learning

1832
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:41,930
policy are you when they would figure

1833
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,170
out what learning policy is I'll answer

1834
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,690
that

1835
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:47,100
I will add one other quick nugget is

1836
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:49,379
that also sometimes the fear of

1837
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:51,930
regulation can be a strong motivator too

1838
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:54,930
so as you work with folks if you're

1839
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:56,850
saying like hey look you have this big

1840
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:58,500
problem and the regulators are aware you

1841
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:00,420
have this big problem why don't we solve

1842
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,700
it before the regulator's come in and

1843
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:11,160
tell you how to solve it that also works

1844
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:12,870
well thank you John from system center

1845
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,090
for information security Germany so how

1846
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:18,210
I have read with a more concrete

1847
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:20,790
question so your opinion so what might

1848
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:23,750
be the difference of a training a user

1849
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:27,510
to avoid falling for misinformation

1850
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:43,260
campaign and training a user to avoid

1851
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:44,880
falling for a phishing I guess I'll say

1852
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:50,010
something because everyone else doesn't

1853
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:53,790
want to so there are different types of

1854
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:55,170
misinformation and I think I would I'm

1855
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,930
not an expert in this area I don't do

1856
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,760
research in this area but have you you

1857
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:03,090
know phishing is a way of trying to

1858
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,850
trick you that you know to give up your

1859
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:07,890
credentials often as part of them

1860
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:10,440
sending you an email or pretending to be

1861
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:11,820
a site whereas general misinformation in

1862
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:17,009
like the news median things is

1863
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:18,840
problematic because it's there they're

1864
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:21,510
sort of the implicit trust of journalism

1865
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,840
and other things and I've seen from

1866
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:28,230
dealing with family members who are like

1867
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,210
to listen to misinformation that once

1868
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:31,440
you get a big enough echo chamber you

1869
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,790
know there's a big discussion of well

1870
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,099
you have your facts and I have mine and

1871
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:37,320
it's like even though there's video

1872
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,970
evidence of this thing being said or not

1873
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:42,690
being said or whatever well my people

1874
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:44,850
say it didn't happen so you know it you

1875
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:46,410
you kind of can't change people's minds

1876
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:48,360
in effective ways does anyone who's done

1877
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:50,510
research in this area so I I started off

1878
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,070
and rambled so now Matt's gonna clean up

1879
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:55,100
no I'm gonna make it even worse

1880
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:56,949
I don't do research in this area either

1881
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,479
but it strikes me

1882
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:01,598
one of that one of the fundamental

1883
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:04,030
differences is with fishing the problem

1884
01:19:01,599 --> 01:19:06,369
is well-defined don't click on that link

1885
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:08,110
and there are usually indicators not

1886
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:10,630
always but usually indicators that will

1887
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:12,489
tell you something odd is going on but

1888
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:14,769
you have to know to look for them with

1889
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:15,820
this information which is I think what

1890
01:19:14,769 --> 01:19:18,579
you're talking about

1891
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:21,159
when you read something there may not be

1892
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:25,090
anything in there to indicate to you

1893
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:28,058
that hey this is not right there may be

1894
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:30,959
depending on your mindset you may you

1895
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:34,110
may think well this is baloney but

1896
01:19:30,959 --> 01:19:36,938
internally it may be very consistent and

1897
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:40,780
so it strikes me that it's a little bit

1898
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:42,639
harder to disambiguate this information

1899
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,768
versus correct information in that

1900
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:47,289
context whereas with fishing it's

1901
01:19:44,769 --> 01:19:50,829
generally once you know what to look for

1902
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:53,768
fairly straightforward yeah so if you're

1903
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:55,539
if you're talking about to fight I I'm

1904
01:19:53,769 --> 01:20:00,729
definitely an expert in this topic by

1905
01:19:55,539 --> 01:20:02,409
the way to follow up on this if you're

1906
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,789
talking about how do we prevent people

1907
01:20:02,409 --> 01:20:05,619
for example from falling for phishing

1908
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:07,659
scams and and I mean how often do you

1909
01:20:05,619 --> 01:20:10,179
see these things and you say there's no

1910
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:12,638
way anyone would fall for this but you

1911
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:15,939
know that people are otherwise they

1912
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:19,179
wouldn't be doing it and and so my wife

1913
01:20:15,939 --> 01:20:24,369
was an estate lawyer so I don't leave

1914
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:27,579
her alone with the kids but she she's

1915
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:30,429
often she deals with elderly often and

1916
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:33,999
and talks about things that happen

1917
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:35,800
mentally as you get older and you know

1918
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:38,590
she'll say I know you take this for

1919
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:42,280
granted but there's a whole

1920
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:44,889
psychological and geriatric aspect to

1921
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:47,829
this so I mean how many of you can say

1922
01:20:44,889 --> 01:20:49,899
my grandmother or my grandfather clicked

1923
01:20:47,829 --> 01:20:52,289
on this thing and you're thinking how in

1924
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:54,849
the world could anyone click on this but

1925
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:57,280
you know I need my I need my driveway

1926
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:59,260
repaved and this thing came in and and

1927
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,018
offered me to do it for 50 bucks or

1928
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:05,229
whatever and there's that aspect to it

1929
01:21:02,019 --> 01:21:06,719
so you know technically that's that's

1930
01:21:05,229 --> 01:21:08,800
not a technical thing that's a that's

1931
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,870
understanding the psychology of how we

1932
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,480
age and

1933
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:15,180
and on that's just one example of lots

1934
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:24,870
of other dimensions that go into this

1935
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:26,810
problem so let's imagine somebody gets

1936
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:29,550
really excited about introducing

1937
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:31,230
computer security education throughout

1938
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:33,690
the curriculum in little modules that

1939
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:35,280
can be added to different courses are

1940
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:36,929
there resources they can go to to find

1941
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,340
these or there are other people working

1942
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,750
in this area that say yeah we're already

1943
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:41,580
in this space and we're helping to

1944
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:43,410
develop these things and we'd love to

1945
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:45,809
have help or love to have people pilot

1946
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:50,010
test these in their classes actually

1947
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:52,410
that's a great question and so I'm going

1948
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:55,800
to nominate you to start the group that

1949
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:59,750
no actually this is a great community to

1950
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:02,760
do that so my experience has been that

1951
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:05,670
just forget about the the little modules

1952
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,510
the courses themselves the community's

1953
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:09,810
been really helpful

1954
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:11,040
I had slides I've shared my security

1955
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:12,690
slides with other people and they've

1956
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,400
shared them with me and Matt shared his

1957
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:18,330
book with me several years ago and my

1958
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,040
students have used that so I can see a

1959
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:21,900
group you know getting together a group

1960
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:24,360
of people who want to do this kind of

1961
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:26,460
thing and just yeah you could list

1962
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,450
things because for me it's being a

1963
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,190
security expert when I'm teaching

1964
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:32,040
another course and something comes up I

1965
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:33,839
say that's dad there's an aspect to that

1966
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,120
that I should let them know but I don't

1967
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,520
really write it down but you know maybe

1968
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,170
maybe as I'm doing it over the next

1969
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,000
couple of years I will actually make

1970
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:44,550
lists of these things that I come across

1971
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,170
and I'd be happy to share them and you

1972
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:47,730
know perhaps get some kind of mailing

1973
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:49,560
group or discussion group together where

1974
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:50,969
we could or a website where we could

1975
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,830
post these things so there's people are

1976
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:54,840
interested in doing this they could see

1977
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:56,940
for example when you're teaching this

1978
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,500
you might want to mention that and so on

1979
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,509
but I think that's a great suggestion

1980
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,580
actually yeah and there are actually a

1981
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:05,000
lot of resources out there that I'll

1982
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:08,760
kind of plug a few that I'm aware of

1983
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:14,460
there's so there's this set of resources

1984
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:17,570
called seed to Saed by Kevin do is that

1985
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:20,940
right said his name yeah Kevin do

1986
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:22,440
they're they're quite nice resources and

1987
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:23,699
there's an evolution of them I think

1988
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,530
it's called cyber train

1989
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:27,710
that I just heard about this conference

1990
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:30,870
I haven't had a chance to check out a

1991
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:34,860
lab trainer lab tainer

1992
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:40,739
sorry about that theirs are also

1993
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:43,170
resources on something called so Richard

1994
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:44,669
Weiss at Evergreen College has a set of

1995
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:47,969
resources that I'm blanking on the name

1996
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:52,020
of they're quite edge arranged thank you

1997
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:53,820
okay see I saved here I I put my slides

1998
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,929
and my materials up and she have shared

1999
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:57,509
them with people they've been used at

2000
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:59,429
about a dozen universities I do think it

2001
01:23:57,510 --> 01:24:03,060
would be great to have though a site

2002
01:23:59,429 --> 01:24:06,030
because like for instance ACM 4 sitcom

2003
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:08,130
had an ACM sitcom resources site where a

2004
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:09,690
lot of people would find and use and

2005
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:11,850
share materials so I would love to see

2006
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:14,370
something like that come along for our

2007
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:17,100
community and and have us just plump

2008
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:19,019
that and other things that anybody want

2009
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,300
to shout anything else out that that we

2010
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:23,489
that I missed

2011
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:25,949
of course deter I mean that's the

2012
01:24:23,489 --> 01:24:28,849
800-pound elephant in the in the space

2013
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:28,849
that's great thank you

2014
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:37,530
Towson is hosting it at Clark Clark that

2015
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,730
Center sorry there's a whole lot of

2016
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,750
modules they've been developed at

2017
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:42,178
different levels that are there

2018
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:43,800
educational materials available great

2019
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:45,510
and is it something that anybody can put

2020
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,410
things on or are we still looking for

2021
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:51,510
like a site that then indexes to all the

2022
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:54,660
resources is anybody aware of that like

2023
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:57,270
you know the the old school like Yahoo

2024
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:59,400
site that would point point to

2025
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:02,100
everything for those of us who remember

2026
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:03,629
those days maybe we still need that

2027
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,429
resource out there that points that

2028
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:11,160
anybody can go and ask the resources to

2029
01:25:05,429 --> 01:25:13,650
be added to but any question may be

2030
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:15,929
mostly for a human but everybody else as

2031
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:18,660
well a team you've done a lot of work on

2032
01:25:15,929 --> 01:25:20,640
online education for cybersecurity and I

2033
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:24,059
was curious what you think is lost by

2034
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:26,219
going online if anything or if all of us

2035
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,650
should be scaling I programs by putting

2036
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:30,179
them online like as fast as possible so

2037
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:34,440
I can't just look at Matt and until he

2038
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:35,010
takes it into it ok ok no so that's a

2039
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,108
great question

2040
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:40,379
I'll tell you about

2041
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:42,689
three years ago I was the the most the

2042
01:25:40,379 --> 01:25:45,749
the most significant skeptic of online

2043
01:25:42,689 --> 01:25:47,519
education and at Tec we started about

2044
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:50,398
six years ago all my master's in CS

2045
01:25:47,519 --> 01:25:53,039
which is ridiculous it has 10,000

2046
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,839
students it's just insane and I was

2047
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:56,219
completely they kept saying we need more

2048
01:25:54,839 --> 01:25:58,199
security courses you need to teach this

2049
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:00,809
course on us in the program and I said

2050
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:03,329
no I mean typical faculty member nope I

2051
01:26:00,809 --> 01:26:05,429
love what I'm doing I'm great I teach my

2052
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:07,139
one class or whatever a year to class

2053
01:26:05,429 --> 01:26:09,059
yeah I got the notes for it

2054
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:11,579
I do it exactly to it in the same room

2055
01:26:09,059 --> 01:26:13,559
or I complain I get it's perfect I don't

2056
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:14,879
want to just disturb what I'm doing and

2057
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:17,280
I'm and I'm not sure about this whole

2058
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:18,570
online thing period so that was me three

2059
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,009
four years ago now fast forward of

2060
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:22,799
course now I'm the director of our

2061
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:25,679
security online program so so they

2062
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,059
finally convinced me to do it and what

2063
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,239
we have I'll describe it a little bit is

2064
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:32,820
that we have we've recorded courses so

2065
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:34,169
it's completely asynchronous we spent a

2066
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,419
lot of time there's a lot of resources

2067
01:26:34,169 --> 01:26:37,709
for support so we have we use Piazza to

2068
01:26:36,419 --> 01:26:39,329
communicate you guys what I do that too

2069
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:42,419
but we really spend a lot of time and

2070
01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:43,709
and how they integrate Piazza with the

2071
01:26:42,419 --> 01:26:45,659
other tools to make sure that we can

2072
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:50,489
communicate with our students and vice

2073
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:52,799
versa so what I've found that that I've

2074
01:26:50,489 --> 01:26:53,938
lost because we actually teach I mean in

2075
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,459
all the security folks that you know

2076
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:58,349
Winky and taste to others I'm a stock

2077
01:26:56,459 --> 01:27:01,260
all of them actually teaching we teach

2078
01:26:58,349 --> 01:27:02,399
the exact same course we teach as exact

2079
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:06,059
same faculty members would give the

2080
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,859
exact same exams exact same projects so

2081
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:09,539
that honestly that first cycle of

2082
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:12,209
actually teaching it and giving all the

2083
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:13,949
same stuff to the folks online no campus

2084
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:16,379
and then realizing that the averages

2085
01:27:13,949 --> 01:27:17,938
were the same we're very close that

2086
01:27:16,379 --> 01:27:19,619
honestly convinced me so I wasn't

2087
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:21,389
convinced until I actually did it now

2088
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:23,489
I'm like oh this thing actually works

2089
01:27:21,389 --> 01:27:25,379
what I miss is what I what I'm getting

2090
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:27,089
right now which is like reactions from

2091
01:27:25,379 --> 01:27:29,369
people in the audience and I you know

2092
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:31,169
when I when I teach I really love to to

2093
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:33,329
read my students faces and really if I

2094
01:27:31,169 --> 01:27:34,949
have time to you can quickly tell that

2095
01:27:33,329 --> 01:27:36,599
people don't understand or they're not

2096
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:38,428
paying attention and you really can make

2097
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:39,959
that that classroom environment much

2098
01:27:38,429 --> 01:27:42,030
more engaging by getting that immediate

2099
01:27:39,959 --> 01:27:44,669
feedback so I I missed that I mean I

2100
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:47,938
think that that we can't get that back

2101
01:27:44,669 --> 01:27:50,219
what we gain so much this program

2102
01:27:47,939 --> 01:27:50,880
actually our programs the it's it's very

2103
01:27:50,219 --> 01:27:52,380
different

2104
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,110
it's pretty much a social science

2105
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:57,450
experiment too so we've written papers

2106
01:27:54,110 --> 01:28:01,320
about our programs but the average

2107
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:02,580
student is like 35 or 37 years old half

2108
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,670
of the students already have a graduate

2109
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:08,790
degree many have PhDs so what happens is

2110
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:11,070
doing this Piazza discussion you're no

2111
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:13,380
longer the only expert so they're

2112
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:16,710
actually you know 15% of the class

2113
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:19,260
they're actually also experts so now I

2114
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:20,400
learned more stuff as well as the other

2115
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:22,950
students because you got people that

2116
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,839
work for 20 years and you know process

2117
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:26,639
control engineering that are now learnt

2118
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,580
taking my cyber-physical system security

2119
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:31,800
course so we lose some things but we

2120
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:34,470
gain so much and that it made us double

2121
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,990
down so we created an ICS program that

2122
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:38,820
Ole Miss analytics online masters is OMS

2123
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:43,349
and now we have this OMS cybersecurity

2124
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:44,929
program so I'll just piggyback something

2125
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:48,090
on there because we also have a large

2126
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:49,440
online program and I'll just speak more

2127
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:51,570
from the instructor perspective as

2128
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:54,330
someone who's been recording and been on

2129
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:56,450
the other side of this a bit so and and

2130
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:58,559
I know our process at NYU is probably

2131
01:28:56,450 --> 01:29:02,190
has some differences with Georgia Tech

2132
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:03,690
but it was definitely a lot of work to

2133
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,960
go and put this together and do quality

2134
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:08,730
control but it was very rewarding and if

2135
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,350
you put good work in then the students

2136
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:16,349
do really enjoy it and do really get

2137
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:17,640
engaged you the scaling the assignments

2138
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:19,170
is something you have to think a little

2139
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:21,810
more carefully about because it's no

2140
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:23,520
longer a problem of just you know

2141
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:24,990
threaten the TAS more that you'll take

2142
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,490
away their stipends if they don't get

2143
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:28,019
the grading done or I don't know I've

2144
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:31,530
never had to do that I'm just you know

2145
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,120
trying to joke around but if you design

2146
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:34,170
your assignments and design your modules

2147
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,300
well and have really good course

2148
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:37,440
creators then the whole process is a lot

2149
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:47,700
smoother than you might think

2150
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:50,160
and the quality is still very high I

2151
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:51,690
think I think online courses are great

2152
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,389
and and certainly at a place like

2153
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:56,280
Richmond we think about will there be

2154
01:29:54,390 --> 01:30:01,050
colleges in 10 years that you actually

2155
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:02,580
have to go to so and in fact I've used a

2156
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:03,940
lot of online courses myself and

2157
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,950
materials I'll contact

2158
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:08,290
instructors and say hey can I use that

2159
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:10,450
material to teach my students here you

2160
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:12,910
know some of my research students and

2161
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:16,030
and people yeah sure take you know you

2162
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:18,550
sign them up and do this it's great the

2163
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:21,219
things that you miss are as you said the

2164
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:23,380
personal interaction working with

2165
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:25,210
research students I get to know how they

2166
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:28,270
work how they deal with certain kinds of

2167
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:31,660
pressure I get to know how they work

2168
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:33,700
with each other and so and but most

2169
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:35,230
important and maybe this will be

2170
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,290
irrelevant in the future if we go to

2171
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:42,660
this but you know a lot of aspects of

2172
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:44,530
see us deal with working with others and

2173
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:48,610
when I write a letter of recommendation

2174
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:50,620
for a graduate school I remember when I

2175
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:52,540
had my postdoc at Maryland many years

2176
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:56,080
ago I had 70 kids in the class and three

2177
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:58,600
TAS and I you know I could say student X

2178
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,400
got an A in my class the the grade

2179
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:02,950
distribution was this that was about all

2180
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:04,450
I could say when someone at Richmond

2181
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:05,740
asks me to write a letter I can talk

2182
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:07,179
about I've worked with them for two

2183
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,950
years this is the way they are they're

2184
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:10,660
punctual they're friendly they do I

2185
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:12,639
can't ask them with these kinds of

2186
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:14,830
things these are things that I couldn't

2187
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,930
get in an online scenario so it's this

2188
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:19,210
is not a critique of of online

2189
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:21,160
universities I think they I think like

2190
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:23,530
many other things they serve a really

2191
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:25,320
good purpose and do a lot of good but I

2192
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:28,030
don't know that they'll replace

2193
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:33,190
traditional education or I don't think

2194
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:35,259
it will again I didn't want to I Jack

2195
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:38,769
the conversation so I sat back and now

2196
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:40,270
I'm here again mostly because I was not

2197
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:41,860
very satisfied with the answer that I

2198
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:43,060
got right and I think that partially

2199
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:45,519
that's because I've been a bit sloppy

2200
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:48,460
with how I formulated my questioning in

2201
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:52,200
a way so allowed me to get back again to

2202
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:54,490
that offensive part of the discussion

2203
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,990
because I mean computer security and we

2204
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:57,849
seen also today where there's been

2205
01:31:55,990 --> 01:32:00,099
around for just about as long as I've

2206
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:02,110
been writing about the 1980s started

2207
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,900
being integrated into computer science

2208
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:06,820
courses and it's been you know been also

2209
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,889
academically a bit of an afterthought

2210
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:11,469
because when it started gaining a lot of

2211
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:13,870
momentum then we realized as a community

2212
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:16,360
that we need to add these courses on

2213
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:17,739
computer security in no computer science

2214
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,919
majors

2215
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:22,570
now I think that with the offensive side

2216
01:32:19,919 --> 01:32:24,579
we are a bidder in the same moment where

2217
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:27,398
we starting to realize that yes building

2218
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:29,499
secure software is extremely important

2219
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:32,139
user awareness is extremely important

2220
01:32:29,499 --> 01:32:33,639
but will never most likely get to a

2221
01:32:32,139 --> 01:32:36,669
point at least because you can always

2222
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:39,609
fool a human that a system is completely

2223
01:32:36,669 --> 01:32:41,229
secure and so the other tension part the

2224
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:43,030
wire where you actually have the

2225
01:32:41,229 --> 01:32:44,889
attackers that you know compromised the

2226
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:48,669
systems is gaining a lot of momentum as

2227
01:32:44,889 --> 01:32:50,979
well and so my question is and also goes

2228
01:32:48,669 --> 01:32:53,139
back to your answer before is that when

2229
01:32:50,979 --> 01:32:55,209
everybody is teaching a little bit of

2230
01:32:53,139 --> 01:33:00,339
red teaming a little bit of penetration

2231
01:32:55,209 --> 01:33:02,530
testing etc but from my perspective I

2232
01:33:00,339 --> 01:33:04,780
think that the curriculum of a pen

2233
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:06,369
tester is extremely different from the

2234
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:09,009
curriculum of a person who builds secure

2235
01:33:06,369 --> 01:33:12,308
software for example think of social

2236
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:14,499
engineering techniques or think of the

2237
01:33:12,309 --> 01:33:16,269
art of the section or things like that

2238
01:33:14,499 --> 01:33:19,510
these are not things that a software

2239
01:33:16,269 --> 01:33:21,609
developer to be secure C code is you

2240
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:23,229
know needs to know so if we need to

2241
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:26,050
build and this goes back to the first

2242
01:33:23,229 --> 01:33:28,959
point of at least at the beginning where

2243
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:31,599
we where should computer security stand

2244
01:33:28,959 --> 01:33:33,519
at academia versus industry level how

2245
01:33:31,599 --> 01:33:37,780
integrated should it be if we need to

2246
01:33:33,519 --> 01:33:40,209
build real pen testers people that are

2247
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:42,820
really capable of getting into system

2248
01:33:40,209 --> 01:33:44,619
from reconnaissance to reporting to

2249
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,780
social engineering to integrating with

2250
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:49,329
technological attacks and all that

2251
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:51,999
we need to train them and if we just

2252
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:54,398
teach one offensive computer security

2253
01:33:51,999 --> 01:33:57,579
course or we have a red team challenge

2254
01:33:54,399 --> 01:34:00,189
in a major is that enough or we need to

2255
01:33:57,579 --> 01:34:02,949
start thinking of changing a little bit

2256
01:34:00,189 --> 01:34:05,019
the way in which there is a course on

2257
01:34:02,949 --> 01:34:07,329
defensive techniques and there is a

2258
01:34:05,019 --> 01:34:09,339
major offensive techniques and keeping

2259
01:34:07,329 --> 01:34:11,289
these things talking to each other but

2260
01:34:09,339 --> 01:34:15,369
separate and specializing in these

2261
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:20,079
things I think this comprehensive yes so

2262
01:34:15,369 --> 01:34:21,579
a lot of programs like ours have like

2263
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:24,009
separate we have a separate offense of

2264
01:34:21,579 --> 01:34:27,280
security from penetration testing class

2265
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:28,859
and we have multiple different classes

2266
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,550
that are more in like application

2267
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:33,250
defensive

2268
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:35,200
and security and so on but from a

2269
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,610
fundamental standpoint in the beginning

2270
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:38,320
you do have to start with people

2271
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:40,509
understanding threat modeling and

2272
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,340
understanding the way in which attackers

2273
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:44,650
might attack systems so there will I

2274
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:47,290
think as you rightfully point out always

2275
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:49,389
be some overlap students tend to

2276
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:51,519
self-select themselves into do I want to

2277
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:54,460
take all the offensive classes do I want

2278
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:57,610
to take mostly defensive classes and

2279
01:34:54,460 --> 01:35:01,650
blockchain and whatever else and not you

2280
01:34:57,610 --> 01:35:03,670
know not do this but in in in order

2281
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:07,000
actually some some research we did

2282
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:08,710
showed that you that defenders in order

2283
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,870
to be good at defense you have to be

2284
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:12,370
able to understand effectively how to

2285
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:14,440
attack or at least the students that

2286
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:19,570
were good at defense we're also good at

2287
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:21,400
attack because you you have to think

2288
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:22,960
about what can go wrong and understand

2289
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,570
this so that perspective I think is

2290
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:28,420
valuable for everybody but you're right

2291
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:29,980
that maybe we don't need to spend we

2292
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:31,690
don't need every student that's going to

2293
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:34,690
write defensive code to go through an

2294
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:39,849
eight-course sequence on various levels

2295
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:43,240
of penetration testing well and also I

2296
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:45,280
mean from a if I understood your

2297
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:46,450
question correctly you were talking

2298
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,980
about there are all sorts of other

2299
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:49,750
aspects of things there's the social

2300
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:53,290
engineering aspect there's it's a very

2301
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:54,820
vertical thing and my thought was you

2302
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:57,790
know we're not going to turn out

2303
01:35:54,820 --> 01:36:00,009
students who are are prepared to to go

2304
01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:02,530
right in there and and do everything

2305
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:04,030
they need to do I liken it sort of to a

2306
01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:06,309
professional athlete the rookie

2307
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:07,599
professional athlete who you can go

2308
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:09,100
through training camp and you can learn

2309
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,960
the moves but until you're in the game

2310
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,340
you're not going to learn certain things

2311
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,160
and no one's going to teach them to you

2312
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:17,560
and so we try to prepare them as best we

2313
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:19,210
can but ultimately doing the job is

2314
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:21,430
where they're going to really gain the

2315
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:24,100
experience and then there's a experience

2316
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:27,160
actually means something to to know all

2317
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:30,070
of the things they have to do I don't

2318
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:32,139
think any education is going to plug

2319
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:35,679
every single hole that needs to be

2320
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:38,950
plugged and so right now we're talking

2321
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,120
about primarily CS programs I mean

2322
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:42,130
that's what we're putting out and then

2323
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:44,830
they will get little nuggets in there as

2324
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:48,290
you know security courses

2325
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:50,360
and there are only a handful of security

2326
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:52,400
undergraduate degree programs in the

2327
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:56,420
country so I think at least in the u.s.

2328
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:59,509
so I think you have a valid point and as

2329
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:03,139
we move to undergraduate security

2330
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:05,690
degrees if it's a market demands for

2331
01:37:03,139 --> 01:37:07,699
that then I think you will see more

2332
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:09,619
specializations within security but

2333
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:12,650
right now we're in computer science or

2334
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:14,540
ECE and then it's folks that have you

2335
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:16,040
know a few security courses and then

2336
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:18,980
they're taking the offensive course

2337
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:20,929
within that and I don't mean pin testing

2338
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:22,909
right now still very niche right so I

2339
01:37:20,929 --> 01:37:24,889
don't think you would have a path if you

2340
01:37:22,909 --> 01:37:26,299
will for that but I see it evolve into

2341
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:28,340
that honestly

2342
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:30,409
so at Tech we have one thing I like

2343
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:31,520
about Tech and I'm just a shout out to

2344
01:37:30,409 --> 01:37:35,210
the College of Computing which I'm not

2345
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:37,670
in is they have like 13 different

2346
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:40,310
threads so it's 13 different flavors of

2347
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:41,630
the computer science degree so if you're

2348
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:45,710
really interested in being close to

2349
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:47,989
hardware or algorithms or security then

2350
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:49,969
your your CS degree is tailored

2351
01:37:47,989 --> 01:37:50,360
according to this threat which is really

2352
01:37:49,969 --> 01:37:53,389
neat

2353
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:55,790
well imagine as time continues and

2354
01:37:53,389 --> 01:37:58,820
security continues to broaden which it

2355
01:37:55,790 --> 01:38:00,980
will you have something very similar and

2356
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:03,019
you have this pentesting 3 that has the

2357
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:04,428
the military science type courses in it

2358
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:06,469
and all the other sociology and

2359
01:38:04,429 --> 01:38:08,599
psychology I mean I see that that that's

2360
01:38:06,469 --> 01:38:12,409
coming and it makes sense but I don't

2361
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:13,520
think in a university you know a trade

2362
01:38:12,409 --> 01:38:14,900
type program would do that but

2363
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,790
university would not RIT be ready to

2364
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:19,969
commit just something like that I would

2365
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:22,250
think in the immediate future thank you

2366
01:38:19,969 --> 01:38:25,340
okay I wanted to close out our panel

2367
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:27,260
which is titled security education with

2368
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:29,869
a question about not cyber security

2369
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:31,730
which is most of what we focused on so

2370
01:38:29,869 --> 01:38:33,920
we also have a lot of other topics that

2371
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:36,110
come up at this conference like privacy

2372
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,719
as well as sometimes a crimes and

2373
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:40,250
harassment and stalking and partner

2374
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,020
violence and so on and so forth and

2375
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:44,690
that's at least in my experience often

2376
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:47,989
not a topic in our security courses

2377
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:49,790
either technical privacy or what do I do

2378
01:38:47,989 --> 01:38:52,159
if this happens to me so is that

2379
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,840
something you guys have addressed or do

2380
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,909
you have sort of food for thought as we

2381
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,960
leave the panel about how we might think

2382
01:38:55,909 --> 01:39:00,349
about adding

2383
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:02,060
issues into courses moving forward so I

2384
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:04,730
mentioned I have this like what could

2385
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:05,540
possibly go wrong part of the class that

2386
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:07,009
I talked about where I talk about

2387
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,950
real-world examples and I do actually

2388
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:11,960
talk about some of those types of issues

2389
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:13,790
maybe not go not going into the same

2390
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,680
level of depth and things like that as

2391
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:18,290
the excellent speakers here but I do

2392
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:21,230
think it is absolutely something that

2393
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:23,360
people should get some exposure to and

2394
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:25,700
and know something about and having

2395
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:28,519
real-world examples like that that maybe

2396
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:30,019
a friend or you know their cousin or

2397
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:33,200
something went through hopefully not

2398
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:34,820
them but you know I think also helps

2399
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,380
students to connect and can be a better

2400
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:42,830
way to really draw people in and get

2401
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:45,530
them to care about the topic I want to

2402
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:47,480
talk about confidentiality I also talk

2403
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:49,700
about privacy because of the control

2404
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:52,968
aspect of it done slight distinguishing

2405
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:55,599
as far as the others go I know our

2406
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:59,150
university has an introductory course

2407
01:39:55,600 --> 01:40:01,760
that students get in the summer that

2408
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:05,480
covers a lot of that I also use them as

2409
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:07,070
examples at the beginning of class but I

2410
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:11,989
don't go into any kind of depth about

2411
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:14,210
them yeah I as I said I aside from the

2412
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:16,099
it's certainly my regular courses I

2413
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:18,620
don't I talk about what can happen but

2414
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:20,120
it's really the sort of road map course

2415
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:22,610
that I teach during the summer for a few

2416
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:24,700
days where I where I'm talking about

2417
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:27,469
privacy and I'm getting across to them

2418
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:31,790
sort of what what information is out

2419
01:40:27,469 --> 01:40:33,440
there about you which actually I did an

2420
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:35,000
experiment some years ago where I gave

2421
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,769
one of my student it was actually a high

2422
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,960
school student who is now a student and

2423
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:41,210
I said you have two hours to find out

2424
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,110
everything you can about me you can't

2425
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:44,210
pay for anything

2426
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:46,610
you can't break any laws you can't hack

2427
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:51,350
anything and I got to tell you I was

2428
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:53,599
astounded by what he found so so I try

2429
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:55,489
giving it to a class of 100 masters or

2430
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:57,469
you know masters and undergrads as I did

2431
01:40:55,489 --> 01:40:59,750
my first semester it was interesting

2432
01:40:57,469 --> 01:41:01,040
yeah yeah I was he was like he was

2433
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:02,840
telling me things I didn't even know the

2434
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:06,980
name of the doctor who delivered you was

2435
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:09,260
and house like wow but and he gave me

2436
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:11,870
like my last 20 addresses like

2437
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:13,760
but the point is that that's we do talk

2438
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:15,980
about some of those issues as far as

2439
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:19,340
other things such as which are important

2440
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:21,469
such as if I'm the victim of one of

2441
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:24,140
these things what do I do I'm not sure I

2442
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:27,260
know the answer I mean I was I was a

2443
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:29,810
victim of the target they actually my

2444
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:31,910
wife charged something and and so we

2445
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:34,220
were one of the folks that and you know

2446
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:36,080
we sort of played it by ear and had to

2447
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:39,020
figure out as we go I I wouldn't be

2448
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,489
qualified to teach that and I'm not sure

2449
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,900
a CS course would be the place to teach

2450
01:41:40,489 --> 01:41:45,589
it either it's sort of like a life

2451
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:47,960
skills course these days yeah I'm gonna

2452
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:50,330
take the easy way out and say I haven't

2453
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,410
taught the undergraduate course where I

2454
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:54,500
thought it would I think it would be

2455
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:57,019
appropriate in three or four years but I

2456
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:58,430
think it's it's important and and it

2457
01:41:57,020 --> 01:42:01,550
makes sense for it to be in there but

2458
01:41:58,430 --> 01:42:03,200
I'll take a cop out okay thank you thank

2459
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:04,250
