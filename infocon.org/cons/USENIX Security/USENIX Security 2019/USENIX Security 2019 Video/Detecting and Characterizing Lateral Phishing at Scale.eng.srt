1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,209
thank you so much for the introduction

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,560
David my name is grant and today thank

3
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,610
you so much for the introduction David

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,168
my name is grant

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,849
and today I'm going to talk about some

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,080
cool work that I have done while

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,759
research internet Barracuda Networks

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,008
along with the host of wonderful

9
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:27,390
colleagues and collaborators eric is

10
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:30,000
looking at an emerging form of

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,320
enterprise phishing so typically when we

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,759
think about enterprise phishing attacks

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,649
we have the following meant to model in

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,719
our heads we have some external attacker

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,550
who's trying to breach an organization

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,989
or enterprise and the way they'll do

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,760
this is they'll send some deceptive

18
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,620
phishing email to employees at the

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,690
organization that's designed to trick

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,269
the employee to perform some malicious

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,039
action and oftentimes we see in this

22
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,300
attack but the attacker will masquerade

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,519
there's some sort of trustworthy or

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,849
authoritative identity by spoofing or

25
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:58,409
cleverly crafting some account this is a

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,269
very natural mental model for us to have

27
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,370
because if you look across the past ten

28
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:04,470
years of high profile breaches basically

29
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,890
every attack has stemmed from one of

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,090
these kinds of attack setups our work

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,310
hour is gonna be different

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,720
our work is ultimately going to push us

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,520
to expand our understanding of

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,990
enterprise phishing both in terms of how

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,420
we think about the attack and how we

36
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,280
detect these attacks and we call this

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,350
new form of enterprise phishing lateral

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,939
phishing so in the lateral phishing

39
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,829
attack we are no longer dealing with an

40
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,538
external attacker the world in fact

41
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,339
looks something like this we're at an

42
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:31,320
organization and the attacker has

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,729
managed to compromise an employee at the

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,979
organization or perhaps multiple

45
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,210
employees from this hijacked account

46
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,500
they are then going to send phishing

47
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,890
emails to other employees at the

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,390
organization or perhaps even elsewhere

49
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,590
now this new set up is actually quite

50
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,420
interesting it has a number of

51
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,789
differentiating factors and challenges

52
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,439
from external phishing for one thing

53
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,750
both users and traditional anti-phishing

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,490
systems have a problem detecting well

55
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,920
phishing attacks they're currently

56
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,259
primed to expect inbound attacks from

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,060
external attackers not internal sources

58
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,250
so a lot of detection is based at the

59
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,320
border looking for malicious emails that

60
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,200
we received and not for most us emails

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,419
that come from within someone related a

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,910
lot of current traditional anti-phishing

63
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,440
techniques often search for signals of

64
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,970
spoofing or forgery in the sender

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,740
because that's the predominant mode

66
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,720
we've seen these high profile beaches on

67
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,099
the other hand lateral phishing is not

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,319
going to exhibit these signals right

69
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,760
they've compromised the attacker has

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,619
compromised the legitimate account

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,359
and they're sending the attack from a

72
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,310
legitimate countess there is not going

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,700
to be any spoofing or forgery on the

74
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,870
sender metadata additionally there are a

75
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,518
number of interesting and unknown

76
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,830
questions about larry'll phishing attack

77
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,540
strategies so the attackers compromised

78
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,250
illegitimate accounts and they have

79
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,870
access to the users historical emails

80
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,549
and relationships so they have the

81
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,530
potential to craft really targeted

82
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,629
content against really specific users

83
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,549
that are related to the accounts now to

84
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,518
what extent attackers actually do that

85
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,049
is not well understood and so to address

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,349
these sort of unknown questions and

87
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,670
challenges our work takes two steps

88
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,649
first we explored several different

89
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,328
practical detection strategies for

90
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,220
detecting viral phishing attacks and

91
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,629
their work focuses on phishing attacks

92
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,569
where there's a malicious URL included

93
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,310
within the email second given the

94
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,290
attacks we detect along with user

95
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,609
reported attacks we have dozens of

96
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,650
organizations that experience style

97
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,180
phishing attacks and from this data set

98
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,859
we can then try and understand the scale

99
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,599
and different attacker strategy and

100
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,720
characteristics of this new form of

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,640
enterprise phishing so to start off

102
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,849
let's sort of take a look at the data

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,809
set we used so this is a wonderful

104
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,000
collaboration with Barracuda Networks

105
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,290
and total we were able to look at seven

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,139
months of data across two thousand

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,179
eighteen ninety two organizations

108
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,709
comprised or study so we had almost a

109
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,750
hundred real-world organizations that

110
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,690
were able to analyze and look at the tax

111
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,819
that surfaced within them a subset of

112
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,680
these had known attacks but the majority

113
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,119
of them are sampled at random and so we

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,220
have dozens of organizations that are

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,650
certainly a representative set of the

116
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,209
general population now across these

117
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,040
organizations in a timeframe we have

118
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,500
over a hundred and ten million employee

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,418
sent emails and for each email we have a

120
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,030
variety of metadata as well as the

121
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,040
actual text in the email so with this

122
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,419
really large real-world data set the

123
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,940
first thing we did is we set out to

124
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,410
detect these kinds of attacks we tried a

125
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,700
number of different approaches and you

126
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,289
can read about them in our paper I'm

127
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,000
just going to give you a simple overview

128
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,918
on the slide of one approach that was

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,839
the most effective so we trained the

130
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,370
simple machine learning model and what

131
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,929
is interesting about our approach is

132
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,180
that we think for lateral phishing

133
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,099
attacks it is actually most useful to

134
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,080
train and apply this detector on sent

135
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,550
emails so traditionally when we try and

136
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,930
detect phishing attacks at an

137
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,120
organization we think about scanning

138
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,440
received emails but it's actually more

139
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,120
useful and you have a

140
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,969
your feature set if you apply this

141
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,080
detector and features extraction on sent

142
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,630
emails that come from within the

143
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,520
organization and so our features contain

144
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,050
are sort of comprised three different

145
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,849
categories I'm just gonna give you a

146
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,220
high-level overview again see the paper

147
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,110
for specifics one category of our

148
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,370
features is what we call the lures of

149
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,840
the features and this is sort of

150
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,060
text-based features that tries to

151
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,820
ascertain whether there are fishy words

152
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,380
or phrases contained within the email

153
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,150
the second set of features we extract

154
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,100
are what we call the XY features and

155
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,780
these ask the question and try and sort

156
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,670
of calculate whether or not there's a

157
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,729
malicious URL contained within the email

158
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,620
and finally the third category features

159
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,630
sort of came from sampling a subset of

160
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,920
reported phishing instance what we

161
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,020
notice is that these phishing attacks

162
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,550
are often sent to many users and as a

163
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,099
result the recipients who receive this

164
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,230
email actually don't usually receive the

165
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,420
same kinds of emails together and so

166
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,570
this last set this last category of

167
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,460
features tries to sort of sort of figure

168
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,849
out whether or not the recipients of an

169
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,590
email or sort of a weird set and so with

170
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,540
these three categories of features we

171
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,869
can then take emails that are benign and

172
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,250
attacks from a few dozen organizations

173
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,860
train a classifier and then apply this

174
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,930
classifier on new employee sent emails

175
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,790
from a bunch of different orgs and by

176
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,919
applying this classifier to sent emails

177
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,870
we actually found that given these

178
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,030
features and this approach we have a

179
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,210
fairly effective sort of starting point

180
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,010
detector see our papers for the details

181
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,989
on how we ensure soundest and evaluation

182
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,630
but basically on a clean evaluation data

183
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,040
set what we did is we had attacks that

184
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,169
were reported to us which we used for

185
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,820
training that we manually analyzed

186
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,740
according to a procedure in the paper as

187
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,480
well as the most flagbearer to detect

188
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,550
the detector and so ground truth is hard

189
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,530
we did the best we could which was to

190
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,780
manually analyze reported attacks and

191
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,940
all the most library detector and then

192
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,369
label them as false positives or actual

193
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,680
liable phishing attacks so how do we do

194
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,380
will across 110 different incidents are

195
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,150
at our detector can find roughly 90% of

196
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,590
them and what's also interesting here is

197
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,450
that there's a significant fraction

198
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,380
almost fifty incidents which are not

199
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,960
reported by users

200
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,850
so it's both high detection and it finds

201
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,099
things that users can't report or don't

202
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,930
identify as phishing additionally our

203
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,220
test dataset has nearly 90 million

204
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,400
emails in them

205
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,110
and how do we perform on

206
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,690
well in terms of false pauses we do

207
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,550
quite well less than four per every 1

208
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,680
million employee sent emails are flagged

209
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,760
incorrectly as an attack so overall this

210
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,710
approach does fairly well

211
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,340
right we find a lot of attacks and we

212
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,409
have a few false positives so given this

213
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,388
data set of attacks and given user

214
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,040
reported incidents we can then aggregate

215
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,650
them to understand interesting questions

216
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,150
about lateral phishing at scale so we

217
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,340
have these seven months of data we

218
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,138
aggregated all the attacks across user

219
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,760
reported incidents as well as flagged by

220
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,190
our detector and then total we

221
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,229
identified 154 compromised Enterprise

222
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,410
accounts that were used to send lateral

223
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,909
phishing attacks and in total these

224
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,039
hijacked accounts sent phishing emails

225
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,440
that spanned 180 unique fishing

226
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,760
incidents so conceptually there can be

227
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,710
multiple phishing emails if you have

228
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,260
multiple recipients they all sort of

229
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,150
belong to the same sort of campaign or

230
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,590
incident if they more or less contain

231
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,810
the same content and are sent from the

232
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,789
same sender and so some of these are

233
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,720
found by our detector others were

234
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:55,090
reported by users so with this data set

235
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
of nearly 180 attacks that are in the

236
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,030
real world conducted by real attackers

237
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,280
there are a number of interesting

238
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,450
questions we can answer the first that

239
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,549
we set out to answer night paper is

240
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,979
really how widespread and successful is

241
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,539
this form of enterprise phishing and the

242
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,130
answer to us was actually that this

243
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,650
attack is actually fairly prevalent and

244
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,810
successful right across the randomly

245
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,789
sampled organizations we studied at

246
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,620
least one in seven of them suffer from

247
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,180
at least one level phishing incident in

248
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,979
fact the majority of the organizations

249
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,949
in our dataset suffered two or more

250
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,300
attacks moreover using a very

251
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,610
conservative methodology that we

252
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,870
described in the paper over 10% of these

253
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,520
attackers were able to successfully

254
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,610
compromised at least one new employee

255
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,900
account using this attack so it's both

256
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:40,419
successful and fairly prevalent so

257
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,829
that's one thing but there are a number

258
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,750
of interesting questions we can ask

259
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,339
about attacker strategy for instance

260
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,660
what is the contents what are the

261
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,000
messages that these attackers are

262
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,699
crafting to convince their victims into

263
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,110
performing some malicious action overall

264
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,540
when we analyze the content of these

265
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,520
messages we sort of found that they fell

266
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,140
into sort of two predominant narratives

267
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,720
to pretexts that were used to trick

268
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,130
these victims the first is this sort of

269
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,050
notion that there's a problem with the

270
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,120
recipients account or computer and

271
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,709
they just click on the link or download

272
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,780
some attachment that problem will go

273
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,340
away

274
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,350
the second narrative that we saw which

275
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,360
was by far the most common over

276
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,130
two-thirds of our incidents was this

277
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,050
notion that there's some shared or new

278
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,240
document with the recipients and if they

279
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,099
click on some attachment or they click

280
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,750
on the link to some cloud filesystem

281
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,520
that they'll view this document but in

282
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,250
reality that's a phishing document or a

283
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,750
phishing webpage they'll be led to so

284
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,130
these are kind of the storylines that

285
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,780
these phishing messages used to trick

286
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,910
the victim but that doesn't quite yet

287
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,770
tell us how specific and how tailored

288
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,079
these messages are to the victim that's

289
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,550
receiving them so when we looked at the

290
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,600
content these messages we found they

291
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,209
fell into sort of three different

292
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,730
categories the first category of what we

293
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,140
call generic phishing messages and these

294
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,540
are phishing messages that you would see

295
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,220
by ordinary cyber criminals to any kind

296
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,020
of user not just enterprise right so

297
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,700
please view the documents I sent you

298
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,490
this was almost two-thirds of the

299
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,260
incidents in our data set the next

300
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,390
category which is still generic but now

301
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,220
slowly evolved to the enterprise context

302
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,620
it was about a third of our incidents

303
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,330
and so here's an example of that

304
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,860
it's the attacker telling the recipients

305
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,780
that there's some updated work schedule

306
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,460
that they need to see so this is still

307
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,410
fairly generic you could see this at any

308
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,940
enterprise but it is sort of more

309
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,250
evolved in the sense that it really only

310
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,290
makes sense in the business context so

311
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,600
this is about one third of our text and

312
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,089
then the last category which is the most

313
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,380
specific the most Spearfish she was you

314
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,540
know a little less than 10% of our

315
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,160
attacks and these are so specific that I

316
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,380
can't really even give you too much

317
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,640
detail but basically what happens is

318
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,620
that the attacker refers to something

319
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,710
very specific at the company be it some

320
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,510
item they use or a specific project and

321
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,010
so these attacks really only make sense

322
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,420
in the context of the organization

323
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,450
that's receiving them they really make

324
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,640
sense elsewhere and so what's kind of

325
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,710
interesting or fascinating to me is that

326
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,530
the vast majority of attackers that we

327
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,630
saw across dozens of organizations did

328
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,670
not make the effort to actually write

329
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,050
very targeted messages it's kind of

330
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,790
fascinating right these attackers have

331
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,400
control over a hijacked account that's

332
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,439
real it has email history it has these

333
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,030
relationships other accounts and yet for

334
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,440
some reason or another they decided

335
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,670
they're not going to mine this content

336
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,910
to develop really targeted content

337
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,170
really targeted messages and so at this

338
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,939
point you might say well maybe these

339
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,500
attackers are just lazy and unsafe

340
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,500
educated cyber criminals they're just

341
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,150
not very good at doing things we found

342
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,650
that's actually not quite the case we

343
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,939
found sort of two behaviors that

344
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,340
indicate that at least some of these

345
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,610
attackers are investing some manual

346
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,290
effort into the process so at a high

347
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,700
level a lot of these attacks and we

348
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,579
describe it from the paper actually sent

349
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,020
us several if not many recipients and it

350
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,760
is the case that these recipients will

351
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,640
often reply to the attack they receive

352
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,840
in fact over two-thirds of the attackers

353
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,819
in our data set

354
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,250
received at least one reply from a human

355
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,860
that wasn't an other reply and they take

356
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,360
a variety of forms so for instance a lot

357
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,890
of the replies that the attackers

358
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,020
receive expressed some sort of

359
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,760
skepticism over the email did you mean

360
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,920
to send this to me or can you tell me

361
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,330
more about what this documents about on

362
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,740
the other hand there are some messages

363
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,330
that indicate that victims already

364
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,970
fallen for the attack even if they do

365
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,440
express some skepticism so for instance

366
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,210
this is an example of a recipient saying

367
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,740
hey I logged in to view it which

368
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,910
presumably means they've already given

369
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,590
their credentials to the phishing

370
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,160
website but I don't understand why you

371
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,270
sent this to me so what do the attackers

372
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,189
do with this right they get these

373
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,040
responses and they can choose to ignore

374
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:29,080
them we saw that actually a significant

375
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,589
fraction 1/4 of them actually took the

376
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,760
time to manually reply to the recipients

377
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,770
inquiry the gut so they'd send this

378
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,720
phishing email the recipient would reply

379
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,550
and then the attacker would then in turn

380
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,590
respond so a quarter of our attackers

381
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,359
did this and we saw this across a fairly

382
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,850
large number of organizations 15

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,890
organizations in total now these

384
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,780
responses by the attacker vary in their

385
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,790
level of sophistication some of them

386
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,140
were fairly generic like yes have you

387
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,209
checked this phishing email I sent you

388
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,740
all those were very elaborate right

389
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,570
there was one attacker who is like oh

390
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,270
it's a document it was X Y & Z it's

391
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,000
fascinating it's safe to open you can

392
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,980
view it by logging with you on password

393
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,450
so these attackers actually are quite

394
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,620
interesting to me right we saw that

395
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,720
basically all of our attackers

396
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,310
previously did not spend the time to

397
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,140
develop this really targeted content and

398
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,670
yet at the same time these attackers are

399
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,589
clearly putting the effort to monitor

400
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,490
the inbox and reply to their victims so

401
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,650
another interesting thing that we

402
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,360
observed is that these attackers you

403
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,100
know they send these phishing emails

404
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,390
from real accounts and they receive

405
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,580
replies to the phishing emails they send

406
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,990
but they're using this hijacked account

407
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,800
that the real user is also

408
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,779
simultaneously

409
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,160
using and so this is question of what

410
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,990
about the real user no this is the

411
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,600
attack and what the implications are for

412
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,790
the attacker and what we noticed is that

413
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,560
roughly 1/5 of the attack on our data

414
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,480
set across sort of more than a dozen

415
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,279
organizations actually put in the time

416
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,170
to proactively delete and high traces of

417
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,640
activity so these are attackers that

418
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,349
would go in and delete phishing emails

419
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,779
right after they sent them they would go

420
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,640
to responses that they received and

421
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:59,920
delete those responses or any kind of

422
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,630
phishing related activity so both users

423
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,469
could simultaneously use the account and

424
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,300
the real user probably would never know

425
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,980
and it's also the case that about you

426
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,109
know a third of these attackers who are

427
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,390
being stealthy also take the time to

428
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,010
engage with their recipients and so this

429
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,870
is sort of a very interesting picture we

430
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,029
have attackers who are not really

431
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,769
putting the time to write very tailored

432
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,420
and targeted contents yet at the same

433
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,339
time they're willing to monitor the

434
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,979
victims inbox or the hijacked accounts

435
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:31,630
inbox to sort of interacts to victims

436
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,100
and then hide their activity so the high

437
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,899
level you know our paper goes over a lot

438
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,420
of details this talk is only a small

439
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,890
segment of them but overall our paper

440
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,959
looks at this new phenomenon that we

441
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,490
call lateral phishing and one of the key

442
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,380
takeaways is that we need to sort of

443
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,790
shift the way we think about enterprise

444
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,990
phishing you know there are all these

445
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,420
breaches that come from external

446
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,709
attackers it is the case though that

447
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,360
there's a significant amount of attacks

448
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:54,459
that come from within the enterprise and

449
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,720
by shifting our detection to not just

450
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,670
look at the border and not just look at

451
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,829
emails we received but also ones that

452
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,779
are sent by employees we can protect a

453
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:04,870
our employees but be users at other

454
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,070
organizations and by looking at emails

455
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,270
through a sense that actually unlocks

456
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,970
all these different features that are

457
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,709
useful and this attack is fairly

458
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,390
widespread right one in seven random

459
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:15,479
organizations suffered from it which was

460
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,709
far larger than I actually expected and

461
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,510
we observed that these attackers are

462
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,550
exhibiting interesting investment in

463
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,529
time choices and to how they're

464
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,630
executing these attacks they are not

465
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:27,490
developing this targeted content but at

466
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,529
the same time a significant fraction of

467
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,720
them are willing to respond to victim

468
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,449
inquiries as well as hide traces of a

469
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,100
bit attack so there are a ton of

470
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:37,449
additional details in the paper where we

471
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,220
have all these different fancier

472
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,689
detection strategies which you actually

473
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,640
find in our extended report which will

474
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,260
be posted in the archive as well as a

475
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,630
ton of other interesting questions about

476
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,370
attacker behavior we didn't get to

477
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,170
talk but I'm happy that take questions

478
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,449
about them or read the paper for more

479
00:15:50,170 --> 00:16:04,719
details so thank you so much for your

480
00:15:52,449 --> 00:16:05,829
time questions hi Arianna mehron from

481
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,050
the University of California San Diego

482
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,959
and also congratulations again on the

483
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,829
award and a question about two of these

484
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:20,768
statistics so you said 7% of the emails

485
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:24,638
were targeted and then similarly 19% of

486
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:26,319
the attackers responded when the people

487
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,569
they were trying to fish you know had

488
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,910
some confusion about the EEMA the

489
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:34,810
phishing email did you find are you able

490
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:38,410
to look at what types of employees were

491
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,630
the victims of these targeted emails or

492
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,699
the the other case that I mentioned so

493
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:46,209
one the reason I'm asking is because I'm

494
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:48,550
wondering if you know employees that

495
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,349
have higher status in the company or the

496
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,959
ones that were the victims of the

497
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,509
targeted email or yeah yeah so that's a

498
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,768
great question two parts to that so

499
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,170
we ain't talked about this in the talk

500
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:00,850
but is the case that most of these a lot

501
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,410
of phishing emails are actually kind of

502
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,880
math phishing it's really interesting so

503
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,069
a lot of these emails will target dozens

504
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,079
if not hundreds of recipients some of

505
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,339
whom are at the organization some of

506
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,109
whom or elsewhere so they're not just

507
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,639
targeted to the CEO it's not like

508
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,399
specific larold movement up the food

509
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,949
chain in terms of who is responding to

510
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,589
the attacks that we didn't do we didn't

511
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:23,199
have metadata about each employees

512
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,000
status or things like that and so it's a

513
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,740
little difficult to sort of go digging

514
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,299
and we never a lot of google people and

515
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,830
stuff like that so that's interesting

516
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,720
for future work and I think there's some

517
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,570
literature out there but we didn't look

518
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,450
at that in our doc thank you thank you

519
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,168
front hi um this is agent from Columbia

520
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,809
University

521
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:44,140
so you deployed a classifier for about

522
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,789
over seven months and I'm wondering if

523
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,130
you observed something like the

524
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:50,020
classifiers performance gets worse over

525
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,000
time so I should caveat that this is a

526
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,250
historical analysis so we have

527
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,049
historically emails and then we applied

528
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,470
this classifier on this historical

529
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:01,539
emails so it's not that the

530
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,039
so there is an active evasion what we

531
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,600
noticed is that we segmented our data

532
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,519
set of seven months into three months of

533
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,139
training four months of tests and we

534
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,269
would help some organizations as well

535
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:11,979
and the classifier this is not paper

536
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,019
that performance on a trained ear set is

537
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,940
basically the same as the performance on

538
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,500
the test dataset so over time and over

539
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,129
different organizations the detector

540
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,909
generalizes fairly well thanks for

541
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:24,340
explaining that

542
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:27,580
so I guess another way to phrase it is

543
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,320
even for a passive analysis I'm just

544
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,418
wondering like for example over seven

545
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,750
months did you detect the same amount of

546
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:37,960
attack across this thing like same

547
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:41,200
several months or do you detect last

548
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,269
attack over time so that's a little

549
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,889
harder to answer because the way we did

550
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,529
this is our trained as it has fewer

551
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:49,809
organizations by setup than our test

552
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:51,460
dataset so we trained on fewer

553
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,470
organizations deliberately and then we

554
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,759
test it on later data and this is sort

555
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,809
of mirrors how you would develop a

556
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,519
detector right you don't have all your

557
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,279
organization's and you don't get to see

558
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,200
future data so there are more attacks in

559
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,639
our test dataset later in time but we

560
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,029
also had just have more organizations

561
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:09,939
that we look at okay I'm one more

562
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:13,029
question hi I'm Jody from CMU really

563
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,399
great work um so how did you build the

564
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,870
ground truth for the people who reported

565
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,939
it if a lot of the attackers were

566
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,370
stealthy like I guess who reported it

567
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,190
yes so the reported attacks come from

568
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,959
both users as well as organizations so

569
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,370
organizations will say so there are

570
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,679
attacks that are not reported by users

571
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,239
but the organization after some incident

572
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,129
response has been like oh we have these

573
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,779
phishing attacks and they'll report them

574
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:36,189
to Barracuda and say hey please make

575
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:38,289
sure that we can detect these attacks in

576
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,870
the future so our reported data does not

577
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:43,019
just use reported but also organization

578
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,549
sort of security teams that report them

579
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,860
thank you thank you let's thank speaker

580
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:51,290
again

581
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,290
[Applause]
