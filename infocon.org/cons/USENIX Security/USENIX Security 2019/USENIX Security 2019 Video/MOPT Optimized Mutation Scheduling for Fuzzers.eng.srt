1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,180
thanks for the introduction Anna hello

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,400
everyone my name is usually from Georgia

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,170
University today are gonna introduce our

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,150
work named molt

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,189
optimized mutations scheduling

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,900
forefathers and as this is a joint work

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,810
with chanyoung you

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,959
cherlene G Georgia we Hanley you saw and

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,570
a remember as we all know that fighting

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,220
is popular techniques for exploring of

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,930
abilities and as they are many

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,920
innovating fathers as shown in the

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,620
slides and a mutation pencil fighting is

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,350
one of the most prevalent fighting

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,620
techniques and that is water way folks

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,500
in this paper and here is their general

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,500
workflow here's a general flow of the

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,449
mutation best Fadi and usually the

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,790
father women tends a structure named the

20
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,369
seed poor which contains the in shooting

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,920
test cases and here the in treating test

22
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,409
cases represent ones that can discover

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,610
that can discover new paths or new

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:15,060
crushes then the father will select some

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,860
seeds from the sinful and next to the

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,560
father will mutate the selected seeds

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,610
with mutation writers and to generate a

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,160
new test cases and next the father run

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,620
the target programmed with the new test

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,679
cases and the selected the interest one

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,590
and put them into the support and then

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,320
the process repeats pass on these

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,070
process but one important question is

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,240
that how to improve the funding and the

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:48,300
existing funding works has proposed many

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,250
kinds of new ideas such as improved the

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,350
initial cipro improved seed selection

38
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,590
strategies improve the code coverage

39
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,169
improve integrate with more techniques

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,700
such as the ball exclusion of improving

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,590
the testing speed but how about

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,190
improving the mutation scheduling and as

43
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,289
there is one of our motivations the

44
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,470
mutation schedule schemes cares about

45
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:15,929
how to select a mentorship writers for

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,600
improving feelings which can have

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,100
further to discover morning pants more

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,030
unique crushes or more of an bilities

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,380
then what is the myth

50
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,530
writers let's take a everything example

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,370
material writers characterized where and

52
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,380
how to meet ed miteta deceit and at this

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,350
temperature than the sum of the mutation

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,190
of writers in FL for example the

55
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,959
mutation writers a bit flip to one

56
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,390
represents flipping the to constructive

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,380
piece of where the step-over is one bit

58
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,690
and this figure presented the mutation

59
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,160
scheduling in F where there's three

60
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:02,640
mutations stages in ever and for each

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,060
stage every will use a different method

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,970
to select a mutation writers and for the

63
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,630
for the more other details you can refer

64
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,239
to our paper all the documents or other

65
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:18,959
documents of FL and here come two

66
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,970
questions there is limitation in fashion

67
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,360
see of each of writer descend in the

68
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:27,209
funding process and to figure out these

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,060
questions we can tell some experiments

70
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,910
by you the effort to file some programs

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,850
and as this and this figure showed the

72
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,799
percentages of the entry in test cases

73
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,090
produced by different mutation writers

74
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,650
in the deterministic stage of FL and

75
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,920
there are three programs in this figure

76
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,070
and the different color represents the

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,130
different imitation operators and from

78
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,170
this figure we can easily see that the

79
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,829
different mutation writers and fashion

80
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,530
C's are different and for these three

81
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,560
programs we can see that the mutation

82
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,590
writers believe y1 the beat flip to one

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
and the area state create a more

84
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,209
Encinitas cases than other mutation

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,040
writers

86
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:17,010
therefore we get that it may be better

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,599
to select the mutation of writers based

88
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,700
on this probability distribution but how

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,780
does a first select this mutation

90
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,300
writers and this figure shows that times

91
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,000
that different mutation writers are

92
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,000
selected when the ffs as is the target

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,930
one that had a program and one of the

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,479
West

95
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,389
is that the to a fashion interpreters

96
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,449
are selected for only a small number of

97
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:49,020
times and a week s that maybe not in

98
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,750
fashioned therefore a better mutation

99
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,060
scheduling scheme is demanded and in

100
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,090
this paper we simply simplify the

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,460
mutation scheduling problem as a fun at

102
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,469
funny and optimal probability

103
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,698
distribution of mutation writers and

104
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,590
following which the scheduler can choose

105
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,400
the truth next up writers who when

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,049
testing a target program and our idea is

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,780
inspired by the particle swarm

108
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,360
optimization algorithm and we propose

109
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,440
mutation schedules Kingdom that moved

110
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,729
the most aims to find an optimal

111
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,050
probability distribution of the material

112
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:30,570
writers to improve falling frost let me

113
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,660
give a brief introduction to PN so I was

114
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,960
on piers Leguizamo employs multiple

115
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,479
multiple particles to search illusions

116
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,289
myths and attentively in which the

117
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,870
position it's a candle solution and for

118
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:48,539
each particle each in the swarm it moved

119
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,820
towards the the local best position and

120
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,289
a global best position in each iteration

121
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:58,229
and here is the figure to show the

122
00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:03,150
example of the evolution of the particle

123
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:05,430
in edifice iteration pass on the persona

124
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,239
PSO algorithm and we can see that the

125
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,639
movement of a particle is guided by its

126
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,210
current local best position and the

127
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,940
created a global best tradition and for

128
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,070
each iteration the move the movements of

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,130
the particle is updated by these

130
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,289
formulas and we are the way now

131
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,180
represents the velocity of the particle

132
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,729
and the X no roof is the interpolation

133
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,400
of the particle and airburst the GPS

134
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,889
represent the local path kaliesha and a

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,370
color best position respectively and a W

136
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:41,699
is in initial world and Ariza random

137
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,639
displacement weight and the most easy

138
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,270
design of based on a customized the PSI

139
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,060
Werdum here and in psi I was on a motor

140
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,820
that

141
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,580
each particle represents mutation

142
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,909
brighter and as one represent a set of

143
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,370
mutation of writers and the pleasure of

144
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:05,780
particle represents the probability that

145
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,640
it will be selected and in most as each

146
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,729
position of the particle is updated by

147
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,690
this formula and for more details you

148
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:17,600
can refer to our peppers and the next is

149
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:21,680
the employment implementation of moved

150
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:25,490
and which contains the two parts the

151
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,760
frosting is the motorman framework and

152
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:32,930
the motorman framework consists of four

153
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,460
four modules and the first is the PSO

154
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,550
initialize dish in internal

155
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,909
initialization modules which initialize

156
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,030
the the parameters of the customer PSO

157
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,310
our zone and an axis a palette fading

158
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,590
model which employs the distributions

159
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,050
from the Marvel swarm to performs a

160
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:55,580
funny and recall the moments for

161
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,910
updating an X it's a core funding models

162
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,090
which employs the best one and very

163
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:05,140
variety by the parallel funding model to

164
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:08,539
perform fatty and recalled the mermans

165
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,700
analyzes the PS operating models which

166
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,700
updates the distribution of the swarmed

167
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:18,050
with the measurement from the Paris

168
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:21,200
study and profiling models okay and as a

169
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,480
maltese urban sauce now so you can find

170
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,849
more details and implementation details

171
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,280
in our source code

172
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,390
next is the path mackerel silent mode

173
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:35,449
and we design these dismal days because

174
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,789
that in the ever birth of others they

175
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,640
will spend more times in the

176
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,079
deterministic mutator stage and for

177
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,110
example in these figures

178
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,750
presents the percentages of times and in

179
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,470
street in test cases used and funded by

180
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,500
these three stages in airfare and we can

181
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,900
see that effort spent much more time in

182
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,000
the determining stage and we also have

183
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,930
experimenting and pepper to show that

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,860
there is worried in fashions their form

185
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,128
of the probe

186
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,079
and optimization for that for especially

187
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:12,800
for the afro birth father's name the

188
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,809
past banker for the mode the

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,868
functionality of the pacemaker father

190
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:20,839
mode is that if a mole to have not

191
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:23,299
discovered and a new unique rush or the

192
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,459
pads for long times and which can be

193
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:27,439
said by the users and it will

194
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,290
selectively disable the deterministic

195
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:33,110
stage for the following test cases and

196
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,449
motor provided two types of the

197
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,100
pacemaker for the mood forever of based

198
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:42,410
on the weather the deterministic stage

199
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:45,199
will be relabeled or not and then we'll

200
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:49,610
give the variation result of the mode

201
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:53,389
and we invited and moved on certain

202
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:56,860
real-world programs the details of these

203
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:59,660
programs are shown in this table and

204
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:04,850
then we evaluating the performance of

205
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:07,639
the mobster with the three metric the

206
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,809
frost is number of the unique crashes

207
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:15,709
and pests and this table president

208
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:19,699
number of unique crashes and has found

209
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:21,729
by the three fathers there are ever and

210
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:23,029
the move to effort time and moved

211
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,600
forever

212
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:30,049
and we can see that both efforts hamton

213
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:34,399
I will have fun can find more unique

214
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:36,499
crushes and past than ever and the next

215
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,189
the second dance a metric is the number

216
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:42,259
of abilities and this type of resident

217
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:45,170
the result of the number of are built

218
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:48,199
upon abilities discovered by these

219
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:53,929
fathers and we can see that ever of

220
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:54,889
found 33 von British and a mobile tablet

221
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:58,189
and found

222
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:04,309
88 vulnerabilities and a mocked afro

223
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:06,949
ever found 85 but abilities which

224
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:10,819
therefore this result stem traits let's

225
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:13,959
boost the most ever attempt and boom

226
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:17,530
moves ever ever can find the more

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:22,060
availability is not natural the third

228
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:25,240
metric is the discovered DVDs and this

229
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,939
figure present to the students founded

230
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,460
by is ever and ever moved here for time

231
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,680
and a movie after ever and we can see

232
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,830
that the bottom of - every time they

233
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,130
never can find the more severe than and

234
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:42,760
without Ranjit helps of with a more

235
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:47,170
average high versus than ever and the

236
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:50,260
next is the compatibility analysis and

237
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:55,030
we have to note that moti is not a limit

238
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:57,640
to FL as what flow of the mode can be

239
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,550
implemented on many mutation beds of

240
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,689
others and is therefore we combine the

241
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,699
most schemes with other fathers that has

242
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,650
ever fast and a builder to implement to

243
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:14,050
the mob say for fun times the motel for

244
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:16,150
fast ever and motor visa and this table

245
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,410
shows the number of unique ranches and

246
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:22,030
past one by eight fathers where we can

247
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,089
observe that the multi it's easily

248
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:28,449
comparable with stead of that mutation

249
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:33,270
bed fathers to improve the funding

250
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:35,680
performance the addition we also conduct

251
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,350
further analysis to provide more

252
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,599
comprehensive evaluations and which also

253
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:45,240
contains three parts and Frosty's the

254
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:49,930
studies comment with difference is that

255
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,540
the we evaluate the motif ever and ever

256
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,359
and Angerer and a builder on three of

257
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:59,140
five programs to eliminate the effects

258
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,070
of randomness we wrong as actor meant

259
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:05,110
for study trials in ten days and to

260
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,750
eliminate the effect of the different

261
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:12,520
seeds we run each experiment with

262
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:17,170
different society with a empty seed and

263
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,970
the twenty seed and a 200-seat and at

264
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,280
this figure to dance in the norm of the

265
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,280
unique crushes and funded by these

266
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,560
fathers in sorry trials and we're the

267
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,339
red box represent the

268
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,349
forever the blue box represent every of

269
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,110
the burn books represent anger and the

270
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,330
light blue box represent a wielder and

271
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,140
from this figure we can find that

272
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:43,420
observe the lights the the motif ever

273
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,370
fun more unique crunches with the

274
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:50,290
statics evidence than are the Fathers

275
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:52,089
Ennis mostly evaluations at for the

276
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,660
number of unique marks we have the

277
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:58,750
similar observations as number of unique

278
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,959
crunches and that is the we have still

279
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,800
have observe that the motor forever has

280
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,620
better performance the second is the a

281
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,459
duration analysis of the selection

282
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:16,900
probability in moved and to demonstrate

283
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:19,630
the effective moved in up ten obtaining

284
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,270
the proper proper selection probability

285
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,660
for the mutation writers were recalled

286
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:28,300
the selection probability for several

287
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,980
mutation writers as show in this term in

288
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,250
this figure and the green line

289
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,350
represents the selection probability of

290
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:39,160
each material writers the red line

291
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,050
represents its global best position and

292
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,750
the blue line represents the local best

293
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,990
position and from this figure we have

294
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,240
see that the mobster screams can

295
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,530
generally converges faster to the

296
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,160
prepare selection probability and the

297
00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:01,449
third is a long term parallel analysis

298
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,699
and will run a story instance in off of

299
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:07,330
FL and mob types of town and a mob

300
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:10,030
forever in parallel respectively and the

301
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,790
total serial times of each experiment is

302
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,370
more than seventy days and this figure

303
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,770
to dental result of the number unique

304
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,040
crunch and a pest found by these three

305
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,260
fathers and from this we can see that

306
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,810
the bottom up to effort time than ever

307
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,700
has found more unique crushes and

308
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:31,680
passage after in long term

309
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,680
parallel experiments

310
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,110
next is limitation and the future work

311
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,720
in an another field to work and in the

312
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,100
future we will

313
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:47,370
external mob - two more fathers as mope

314
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,970
- can be easily adapted to many mutation

315
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,710
best fathers and the second we will use

316
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,650
more real-world programs and a benchmark

317
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:59,040
to give a more comprehensive evaluation

318
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,650
on a mold and a third is that we've been

319
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,380
investigated better mutation writers to

320
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,650
further enhance the effectiveness of

321
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,930
mode and certain forces that we will

322
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:15,150
investigate more mutation scheduling

323
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:16,979
schemes finally is the conclusion and in

324
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,800
this paper we we investigates the

325
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,990
drawbacks of the existing mutation

326
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,229
schedule and we propose the novel

327
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:28,740
mutation scheduling skin moved and we

328
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,650
apply the moves as to a several state of

329
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,690
doubt feathers and evaluated them with

330
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,150
the extensive experience to demonstrates

331
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,850
the high fashion see compatibility and a

332
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,250
stem needs of mode and the most least

333
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,470
now of a sauce and you can find the

334
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,860
source code how to move to from this

335
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,950
website and a thank you for the

336
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,970
lessening and and I'm happy to have to

337
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:57,320
take the question now thank you

338
00:16:52,970 --> 00:17:00,320
[Applause]

339
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
questions

340
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,470
nice thought this is a home from

341
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,629
altitude hack I have two questions

342
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,790
the first one is we evaluated the

343
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,430
effectiveness of different a mutation

344
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,188
strategy do you directly use the FL code

345
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:20,370
how do you change something because as I

346
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,970
know NFL different a mutation strategy

347
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:25,679
is not independent which means if one

348
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,040
mutation can be achieved by previous

349
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,140
mutation master messer you skip it which

350
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,340
means if you perform the mutation first

351
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:38,700
it should get more good result so do you

352
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,280
consider this in your evaluation you

353
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,370
mean different material stage are

354
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,280
independent it's not independent no

355
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,540
independent yes is they are conducted in

356
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,658
order all I'm saying if you if the one

357
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,570
mutation can be a

358
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:57,489
by previous one Yakub xscape in the

359
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,019
second of one so which means the second

360
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:05,619
one we have less mutations you means

361
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:09,399
that you always choice the best material

362
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:12,939
writers for example if you can submit to

363
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:15,070
the one bit of lip first into the +1

364
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,349
something but if the plus one can be

365
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,200
achieved the result of plus one can be

366
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:22,779
achieved by for labor one bit so if I

367
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,879
will skip it in that case it's not a one

368
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:29,799
we're not to trigger new pass or

369
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:31,779
something so yeah interact the in fact

370
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,759
with each other so the result story

371
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:39,729
dependent because you didn't consider

372
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:41,919
that it moved that the mutation price

373
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:44,379
reflection is the best on the history

374
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,769
result ok you can please offline our

375
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:50,349
second question is a valid oh is a FL if

376
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,179
I have a motor-car with the option test

377
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:54,820
T which you can skip all the

378
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,769
deterministic fasting are quickly and

379
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,989
let's go to the random fuzzy

380
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:02,649
so when do evolution to use data why all

381
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:07,269
you didn't yes we also conduct this

382
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:09,789
experiment you mean that disable the the

383
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:18,309
deterministic you know we have the

384
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:20,379
results that in this part okay cool we

385
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:24,658
not in this lesson I will explain later

386
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:29,289
and in your paper we also evaluated the

387
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:31,289
effective of the past mag model I mean

388
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:33,970
that the multi is to consist of the man

389
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,609
the move to me from work and in the past

390
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,909
Mac mode the pacemaker will selectively

391
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:43,439
disable the deterministic stage is we

392
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:47,049
also evaluated zero two parts

393
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,229
spiritually okay okay

394
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:52,389
and I our parent they have it have the

395
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:53,169
extra married out okay sounds good thank

396
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:56,379
you thank you

397
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:58,440
let's thank her again

398
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,440
you
