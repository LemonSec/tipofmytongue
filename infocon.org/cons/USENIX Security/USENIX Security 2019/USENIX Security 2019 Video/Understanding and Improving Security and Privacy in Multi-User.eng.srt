1
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,460
okay thank you thank you so much for

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,619
coming to my talk my name is Eric I'm

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,420
doing I'm presenting my work

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,070
understanding and improving security and

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,779
privacy and multi-user smart homes a

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,849
design exploration and in-home user

7
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:29,359
study this is work I did with my advisor

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:32,900
Franzi Reznor who was very helpful and

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,580
did a lot of work on this project so

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,430
smart homes are an increasingly popular

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,930
technology some of Smith's say that 33%

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,580
of households in the u.s. already have

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,010
some sort of internet connected smart

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,780
home device which includes things like

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,140
smart speakers like the Amazon echo

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,539
smart locks door smart thermostats smart

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,010
lights you name it but in the security

18
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,690
and privacy community we have a lot of

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,070
concerns about smart homes because they

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,079
collect a lot of privacy sensitive

21
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,090
information about what people are doing

22
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,800
at home and if they're misused they can

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,199
really negatively impact the physical

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,429
security of the people in the home and

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,000
also the physical environment of the

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,220
home and when it comes to smart home

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,979
security and privacy there's a number of

28
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,560
angles that we can look at one is

29
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,899
network and embedded system security so

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,459
many smart home devices especially older

31
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,259
devices have serious vulnerabilities

32
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:23,509
which could allow remote attackers to

33
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,300
steal private information or to hijack

34
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:27,649
the devices for use in botnets another

35
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,959
big concern is data privacy and

36
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:32,090
surveillance there's a lot of concern

37
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,679
the about the manufacturers of these

38
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,030
devices because they can collect a lot

39
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:37,250
of data about what's happening at our

40
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,690
homes and we're not sure exactly you

41
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,569
know what what is being done with the

42
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,130
data and how securely it's being stored

43
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:45,470
but today I want to talk to you about

44
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,660
multi-user security and privacy which is

45
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,789
how a user security and privacy might be

46
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,420
impacted by the other inhabitants of the

47
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:55,039
smart home and I'll illustrate what I

48
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,009
mean by this with a few examples of

49
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:59,539
tensions and conflicts within smart

50
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,849
homes that stem from security and

51
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:04,179
privacy related issues which we found in

52
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:07,640
a lot of the related work on smart homes

53
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:08,929
so first the data collected by smart

54
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,720
home can be used to violate other

55
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,940
people's privacy in Prior work people

56
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,620
have reported feeling a loss feeling a

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,270
sense of loss of privacy when they know

58
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,460
that other people in the house are using

59
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,350
smart home to track what they're doing

60
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,180
or when information about what they were

61
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,900
doing at home was unintentionally expose

62
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,400
by the smart home software second the

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,019
smart home can be a focal point of

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,450
broader conflicts in the household so

65
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,640
maybe one common example is that people

66
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,738
have been like passively aggressively

67
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,750
changing the thermostat back and forth

68
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,519
just from their phones cuz they don't

69
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,750
want to talk about it but they this is

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
very strongly about the temperature

71
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,849
another is that parents and teens will

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,439
disagree about surveillance policies for

73
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,629
the front door so should the camera and

74
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,650
track who's going in and out is sort of

75
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:58,379
a broader conflict over freedoms and

76
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,959
curfews for teenagers lastly there's

77
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,358
often imbalances and who has power and

78
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,590
who has access in the smart home we

79
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,900
typically see that there's one person

80
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,819
who's very excited about setting up the

81
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,620
smart home and they have all the

82
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,849
accounts they have the passwords and

83
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,120
most importantly the knowledge of how

84
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,319
the smart home works and they can you

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,639
can they can leverage this power and

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,298
access to restrict other people from

87
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,780
using the home or otherwise behave badly

88
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,569
and it contributes to some of these

89
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,930
privacy and privacy issues and conflicts

90
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,518
in the home so hopefully that gives you

91
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,229
some idea of the challenges and

92
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,940
designing smart homes to meet the needs

93
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:39,510
of multiple users in that in the home

94
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,040
but unfortunately most modern smart home

95
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,280
platforms don't deal with these issues

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,870
in a very sophisticated way

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,150
for example the Samsung smartthings

98
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,000
platform doesn't have any support for

99
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,680
multiple user beyond having one account

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,449
for each user there's no permissions

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,129
model or anything in that platform apple

102
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,519
homekit is marginally better in that

103
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,798
they have remote access permissions and

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,939
editing permissions for the home

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,769
configuration and what's really popular

106
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,599
now is the Amazon echo and Google home

107
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,370
which you can use for voice commands in

108
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,228
the smart home but these don't really

109
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,199
support voice based authentication so

110
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,608
any guest or person just shouting

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,020
through the open window might be able to

112
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:26,849
control your smart home so given the

113
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,880
shortcomings in the space we sought to

114
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,169
answer two big questions in our research

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,090
first we want to investigate or

116
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,500
intentionally what are the range of

117
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,979
multi-user security and privacy

118
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,610
challenges that

119
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,980
Smart Home users face in the real world

120
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,260
and second we want to concretely

121
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,360
investigate how should a smart home be

122
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,020
designed to address multi-user security

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,000
and privacy challenges and to

124
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,740
investigate these questions we did two

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,930
things in tandem like the subtitles of

126
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,510
our paper suggests a design exploration

127
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,250
and an in-home user study so starting

128
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,750
with the design exploration our goal was

129
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,460
to develop and evaluate design

130
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,110
principles to address multi-user and

131
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,180
security and privacy issues in smart

132
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,860
homes and so we came to a set of

133
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,750
principles that we derived from prior

134
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,810
work but then we take it a step further

135
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,370
by building out these principles in a

136
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,500
concrete prototype and then

137
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,910
experimentally assessing the principles

138
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,680
and in situ study and so this in-home

139
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,540
user study also serve the dual purpose

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,460
of servicing new perspectives on

141
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,220
multi-user security and privacy in smart

142
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,380
homes because unlike interviews and

143
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,600
surveys which rely on users prior

144
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,460
experience with existing smart home

145
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,350
technology which already does not

146
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,210
support multiple users very well we

147
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,010
could elicit much richer data by putting

148
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,690
something concrete in front of them with

149
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,690
concrete security and privacy features

150
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,980
all right so to start I want to talk a

151
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,350
bit about the threat model of our

152
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,620
research so the multi-user security and

153
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,420
privacy issues that I mentioned earlier

154
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,960
can often vary in intensity and severity

155
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,400
so we might see that in most households

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,320
people might experience these issues as

157
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,700
minor annoyances or things that make

158
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,790
them a bit uncomfortable in their homes

159
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,460
but in the extremes these issues might

160
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,890
manifest as smart home enabled domestic

161
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,150
abuse or intimate partner violence for

162
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,710
example there's a great article in The

163
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,310
New York Times this year about how

164
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,500
abusers can use smart homes to harass

165
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,510
disorient or otherwise spy on the people

166
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,740
that they're abusing and so designing

167
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,240
smart homes to prevent this type of

168
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,830
abuse from occurring is a really

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,260
difficult problem because we're talking

170
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,300
about adversaries that live in the same

171
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,070
home they have physical access all the

172
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:41,230
devices and they control the smart home

173
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:43,570
and so that's it's a we decided that in

174
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,700
our research we were going to focus on

175
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,290
generally cooperative households in the

176
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,690
general case which we still think is

177
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,550
important because today

178
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,840
like today's smart homes barely had

179
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,410
scratched the surface of what can be

180
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,299
improved for the general for the general

181
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,870
case but I still want to highlight that

182
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,610
it's really important to investigate how

183
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,950
to design smart homes that can support

184
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:11,410
and protect people experiencing abuse in

185
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:13,479
their homes with that in mind I want to

186
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,220
propose a few design principles from

187
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,650
improving multi-user security and

188
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,320
privacy in the smart homes of generally

189
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,210
cooperative households we conducted a

190
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,400
systematize ation of prior work on smart

191
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,070
home security privacy and usability and

192
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,450
based on the problems and

193
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,130
recommendations that they made we

194
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,870
hypothesized that smart homes should be

195
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,060
designed to support access control

196
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,910
flexibility transparency of smart home

197
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,310
behaviors user agency and respect among

198
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,340
users and since there's not a lot of

199
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,560
time in my talk or I will just be

200
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,770
focusing on these last two for the rest

201
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,750
of the paper presentation so

202
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,280
particularly user agency we think it's

203
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,930
important to promote because Smart Homes

204
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,429
often take things that were easily

205
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,020
accessible in the physical world and

206
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,000
then when you make them smart you sort

207
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,740
of lock them behind technology and it

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,260
can make it harder for novice users to

209
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,760
understand and access and so which can

210
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,669
lead to some of the power imbalances

211
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,010
that I described earlier we also think

212
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:12,070
that smart homes should be designed to

213
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,110
promote respect among users because we

214
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,730
can to try to minimize the conflict

215
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:21,040
between users and to also discourage

216
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:22,840
inconsiderate types of behavior so we

217
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,250
built a prototype smart home app than

218
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,169
bodied some of these principles

219
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,790
it's called smarter home and it's a

220
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:30,190
mobile app that lets you control a

221
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,930
Samsung smartthings system and we

222
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,059
implemented a suite of access control

223
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,190
and notification features based on

224
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,809
recommendations from prior work and I'll

225
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,099
very briefly describe how some of these

226
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,609
features relate to far broader

227
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,080
principles so first towards our goal of

228
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,850
promoting respect among users in the

229
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,740
smart home we implemented a few features

230
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,440
that could help enforce respectful usage

231
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,810
of the home first of all we had

232
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,670
location-based access controls so one

233
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,229
possible use case for this among others

234
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,560
is you can use it to prevent people from

235
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,300
outside of the home from controlling

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,430
from surprising startling or annoying

237
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,699
you when you're at home by control room

238
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,779
only controlling the devices around you

239
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,580
another feature we implemented were

240
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,160
activity notifications which notify you

241
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,770
when a device's state changes and it can

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,600
it can also tell you exactly who is

243
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,610
doing this change or what maybe was done

244
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,560
by some sort of app or automation in the

245
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,640
smart hub and so someone's remotely

246
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,140
using the smart home in some

247
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,970
inconsiderate way you can immediately

248
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,510
tell who is responsible and start a

249
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,160
conversation about it and then we have

250
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,630
traditional role based access controls

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,219
these can be used for things like

252
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,420
setting up parental controls or

253
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,980
restrictions on guests but also for we

254
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,020
can do things like preventing other

255
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,860
people from accessing devices in private

256
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,209
spaces like your bedroom we also

257
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,730
implemented a few features that could

258
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,949
help support user agency so one of them

259
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,110
is supervisory access control and so the

260
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,910
idea behind this is like if you are a

261
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,160
parent and you want to give your child

262
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,319
to explore how to use technology use

263
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,079
parts of the smart home but you want to

264
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,000
be able to supervise them from doing it

265
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,860
so it'll block basically this will block

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,930
the child from doing things when you're

267
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,520
not around but then if you're like in

268
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,300
the same room to supervise it'll give

269
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,459
them access another feature we have is

270
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,430
reactive access control so this lets

271
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,420
users ask another user for permission

272
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,430
where they would normally be denied

273
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,079
access which might be useful if there

274
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,800
are edge cases where access control

275
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,380
rules might be too strict too strict and

276
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,390
too restrictive

277
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,070
lastly we implemented discovery

278
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,170
notifications so this is a type of

279
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,150
persistent notification that shows up in

280
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,469
your Notification Center it shows which

281
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,060
devices are near you and what their

282
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,740
state are and so if you're not familiar

283
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,689
with how the smart home works you really

284
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,180
have an easy reference to see what

285
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:50,709
devices are smart and making that a lot

286
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,449
more visible so with their prototype

287
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,670
built the next step was to evaluate as

288
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,279
part of our in-home user study and so

289
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,660
I'll describe how how we did this so

290
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,790
first we started by recruiting

291
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,130
participants via ads on Facebook they

292
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,839
fill out a quick survey and then we

293
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,250
would call them up to screen them and

294
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,170
then would select a few of these

295
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,459
participants based on their perceived

296
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,459
commitment level and also their

297
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:15,099
household composition once we selected a

298
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,630
household to participate we would we

299
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,070
would have them choose which smart

300
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,510
devices that they wanted to used for the

301
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,980
study if they were not required to

302
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,180
already own a smart home and we would

303
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,980
purchase devices necessary so once these

304
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,810
devices were shipped to them we would

305
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,610
have an in-home session where we would

306
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,310
conduct an interview and then help them

307
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,080
set up their devices they would use the

308
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,969
devices for over the course of four

309
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,800
weeks before we followed up with them at

310
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,590
the end to get their reactions and

311
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,199
feedback and I should mention this

312
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,620
protocol was also approved by our

313
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,150
universities institutional review board

314
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,570
we ended up recruiting seven households

315
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,740
in total with 19 participants we drove

316
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,330
do you have a diversity of different

317
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,090
household types so we have roommates

318
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,620
couples families with children most of

319
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,160
them did not already own a smart home

320
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,840
and we got them to use a pretty big

321
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,370
variety of different smart home devices

322
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,720
types okay so I will get into now I want

323
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,850
to talk about the results of our study

324
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,670
so again since I'm short on time I want

325
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,260
to just focus on a few findings related

326
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,610
to our design principles of promoting

327
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,920
respect among users and user agency so

328
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,930
first we found that access controls were

329
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,719
used to establish rules for appropriate

330
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:31,449
usage in a few specific use cases and

331
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,970
these included location restrictions on

332
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,750
visitors restrictions on devices and

333
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,680
bedrooms parental controls and then

334
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,430
restrictions on modifying the Smart

335
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,880
Homes configuration there's one funny

336
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,229
example of this where of the

337
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,510
configuration permissions where I asked

338
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,460
a participant who programs and controls

339
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,350
the smart home and the wife said it's

340
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,760
all me and the husband said she programs

341
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,080
it and I break it and she said that's

342
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,680
why he's not allowed to have admin

343
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,210
control read-only access and then later

344
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,219
when we set up we were setting up

345
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,620
smarter home she actually set him as the

346
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:10,720
child role because that would lock him

347
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,370
from messing up the configuration but

348
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,780
outside of those specific cases that I

349
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,370
just mentioned we found that especially

350
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,800
among the regular members of the

351
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,720
household respectful usage of the home

352
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,089
was guided much more by social norms

353
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,110
than the features that we had provided

354
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,730
them so among couples roommates and also

355
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,160
parents with kids we saw that they all

356
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,420
often trusted each other enough

357
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,779
they didn't need to use any sort of

358
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,099
access control when I asked when I asked

359
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,660
this participant about whether she

360
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,449
wanted to use parental controls for her

361
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,560
son she said if my son were a different

362
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:42,969
person

363
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,349
I might not have given him permission to

364
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,389
turn off the alerts for the windows and

365
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,100
the doors but as it is he follows rules

366
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:50,139
exactly so I was not worried about it

367
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,579
but if he had been me if I were him as a

368
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:55,689
teenager I would have turned off my own

369
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:58,449
permissions so another example of norms

370
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:59,980
regulating behavior around privacy is

371
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:01,930
that a few of the tech-savvy

372
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,579
participants were aware that they could

373
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,319
violate the privacy of others in their

374
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,540
home by listening to their Amazon echoes

375
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:10,029
logs or by looking at the camera feeds

376
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,219
but when we asked directly about it they

377
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,269
reported that they chose not to do this

378
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,819
because they didn't find that as

379
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:20,709
acceptable another interesting aspect on

380
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:22,779
that we found about the influence of

381
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,250
norms on behavior is that there are

382
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,579
certain norms that carried over from the

383
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,920
physical home or the dumb home that were

384
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,269
applied to the smart home so for example

385
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,279
participants generally didn't have

386
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:36,069
access control preferences for devices

387
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,259
and common spaces like like lights or

388
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:40,540
door locks or things like that we asked

389
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:42,910
a family about setting location-based

390
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,399
access controls on the lights and the

391
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,469
mom said I don't think we had a need for

392
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,250
them not to its kind of open in the past

393
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,769
they could control them manually we saw

394
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,779
a related phenomenon in the reactions to

395
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,639
notifications so we were worried that

396
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,889
these activity notifications could harm

397
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,480
privacy by revealing information about

398
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,110
people's activities that they wouldn't

399
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,970
have learned otherwise

400
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,060
but participants found that they didn't

401
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,139
really learn anything that they that

402
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,969
that they couldn't have learned by being

403
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:15,370
physically present in the space and

404
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:17,019
noticing it lastly I want to touch on

405
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,800
some difficulties that we faced with

406
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,750
supporting user agency so we found one

407
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,579
one untrue that we discovered was that

408
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,500
our access controls often interfered

409
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:30,399
with other use cases that people had in

410
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,259
the home and opted not to use them so

411
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,509
when we asked one participant about

412
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,129
location-based access controls that they

413
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,559
said that I want to be able to turn

414
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:39,579
things on and off when I'm not at home

415
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,199
because that's a sort of that's sort of

416
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:43,120
a benefit of having smart devices right

417
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,040
it's when you're not present you can

418
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,810
still be present

419
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,910
some ways another issue that came up was

420
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,829
that the UI for our access controls were

421
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,319
fairly complicated despite my best

422
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:57,149
efforts to make them usable and it meant

423
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,949
that most participants didn't end up

424
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,930
setting up these access controls outside

425
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:02,250
of our guided setup sessions so they may

426
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,569
not have been able to actually implement

427
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,569
rules that they might have found useful

428
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,600
all right so moving on to the discussion

429
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,009
the big attack the big takeaway we got

430
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,259
from these findings I think was that

431
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,550
among our participants positive

432
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,680
household dynamics are probably the

433
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,959
biggest factor in preventing multi-user

434
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,579
security and privacy issues compared to

435
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,160
the features that we provide in the

436
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,959
prototype in particular we were we

437
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,870
observed that our participants had high

438
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,000
trust relationships they had existing

439
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,740
positive norms in their homes they were

440
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,810
very communicative about how they use

441
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,269
the smart home and they benefited from

442
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,750
having a researcher facilitated set up

443
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,910
session and so I think it's important to

444
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,769
note that not every household will be as

445
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,839
harmonious and cooperative like the ones

446
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,790
that we recruited for the study but I

447
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,089
think an interesting question to ask is

448
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,069
how I how might we design smart homes to

449
00:16:54,089 --> 00:17:00,420
help scaffold and develop these positive

450
00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:02,250
dynamics in other households and so this

451
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,990
leads me to my rec the recommendations

452
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,030
from our work so first I think a very

453
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,339
promising direction for future research

454
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,168
is to study whether smart homes can

455
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,849
promote social norms that positively

456
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:14,760
impact multi-user security and privacy

457
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,829
so one idea we had her this is to have

458
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,240
apps and devices encourage households

459
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,730
have a meeting when setting up the home

460
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,130
where they can learn about how it works

461
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,470
and to set expectation and norms about

462
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,199
using the home another idea is that

463
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,809
instead of having strict access control

464
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,549
rules we could have the home

465
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,750
automatically detect and people might be

466
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,210
acting inconsiderately

467
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,210
until them pay maybe don't do that

468
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:42,480
we also recommend that Smart Homes use

469
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:44,100
existing existing Smart Homes

470
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,520
incorporate some basic multi-user

471
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,299
features that are usable like access

472
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,440
controls and privacy controls and lastly

473
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,908
I just want to call back to what I'd

474
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,470
brought up earlier in the talk which is

475
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,640
that designers of Smart Homes should

476
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,470
consider how to provide better

477
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,120
protection and safety for

478
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,659
live in smart homes and are experiencing

479
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,219
some sort of abuse so with that thank

480
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:06,330
you all for listening there's a lot more

481
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,980
that's I didn't have time to talk about

482
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,678
it that's in the paper but I want to

483
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,450
thank my advisor frenzy for all the work

484
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,700
she put into supporting me and working

485
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,620
on this project it's in my lab for moral

486
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,210
support and also to our participants who

487
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,239
very graciously invited to our home and

488
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:28,649
very helpful and thought I'm open for

489
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:30,200
questions thank you hi my name is Baca

490
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,129
from the University of British Columbia

491
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,559
thank you very much for your

492
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:37,529
presentation that was helpful um I was

493
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,769
very curious on why you didn't decide to

494
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:44,220
use participants we're currently using

495
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:46,379
smart home devices or participant have

496
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,480
reported facing challenges because you

497
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:51,240
mentioned that most of them didn't find

498
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,889
this useful they just wanted to do the

499
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,450
social norms so if people were already

500
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:56,129
finding if people were already having

501
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,809
challenges doing this and then they used

502
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:59,340
your prototype do you think that would

503
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:02,340
have helped them in deciding if it was

504
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:05,309
useful or not yeah that's that's a

505
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,620
really good question I think the reason

506
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,500
why we did that so is that we wanted to

507
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,120
avoid biasing our biasing our

508
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,740
participant pool to early adopters a

509
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,620
smart home technology who are generally

510
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,620
much more tech savvy and would make more

511
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,018
use of access control features like that

512
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,070
and we want to make sure that the things

513
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,870
that we were building were also

514
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,639
accessible to people who are more novice

515
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:31,080
users and were less experienced with the

516
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:32,820
technology hi thank you for your talk my

517
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,490
name is Mohammed I'm from University of

518
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,379
california-irvine I have a question

519
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,539
about the implementation of this idea

520
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:43,439
how do you differentiate between

521
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:48,019
different users especially when they use

522
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,789
an audio activating device like Alex

523
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,190
yeah that's that's a good question

524
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:55,649
that that's actually something that came

525
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,019
up in our study our implementation

526
00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:01,350
basically tied each particular user to

527
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,389
their to their smartphone and one big

528
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,590
problem is that if you used alexa and

529
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,240
amazon echo or google home you could

530
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,549
actually sidestep the access controls

531
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,750
entirely because these these are not

532
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,100
tightly integrated with our system and

533
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,960
with smart homes in general because of

534
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,809
the way they authenticate so that's

535
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,760
actually a big problem and those types

536
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:22,129
of devices should be better integrated

537
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,860
with smart homes in general thanks so to

538
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,770
not keep everyone from lunch I'd like to

539
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,959
encourage the last few question Oscars

540
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,789
to get in touch with Eric now after the

541
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,010
session and I just want to thank

542
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:39,010
everyone for coming to the session just

543
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,010
[Applause]
