00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,309
hello everyone my name is Jennifer I'm

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,950
from university Oh Chinese doctor

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,430
Michael since my presentation is about

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:26,119
understanding and the securing device or

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:31,220
ability through automated bug report

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:34,280
analysis nowadays many IOT device with

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,489
communication capability helping connect

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,670
to the internet such as camera rotor

9
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:44,120
printer and the UN so in vast country

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:47,840
system and the medical device Kitana

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,390
reported that nearly fell upon family

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,050
new out device were cutting connect

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:01:00,050
irritate and are moving toward more than

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:03,110
20 billion by 2020 and in little the

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,810
development and to the adoption or on

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,409
land IOT device where promote economic

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:13,100
crews and also improve the living

18
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:16,569
understanding of our daily life this LT

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,908
device such as smart home smart building

20
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:23,679
playing an important rule in our daily

21
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:27,380
life hype up as country and managing

22
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:29,420
device now easily and bridge in the

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,229
cyber space and the physical world

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:37,639
however this outed device also yet some

25
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:41,029
security Chinese random security

26
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:44,119
instance as a Maria port at which extort

27
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:46,429
money out a device at pata pata night

28
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,549
and the USA to perform

29
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:52,130
DDoS attack cross the internet so as

30
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:55,509
disruption across United States and

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:59,779
Europe it is also reported that

32
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:04,189
peacemaker ATM motion and the UN discard

33
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:07,630
system have been compromised as we say

34
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:10,299
this us ot device also here's some

35
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:14,000
security challenges in our daily life

36
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,120
affect our life security prepare take

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,420
and you and the results and the

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,370
environment in our research we folks are

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,260
internet connect IOT device

40
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:32,730
as camera Rooter which posts that attack

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:35,970
surface on the internet this internet

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:39,679
connects device are reported the

43
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,379
two-piece hectare outer wall ability

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,110
including those crossed by maze

45
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:48,390
measurement and miss comfurt collision

46
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,480
starless and clearly as a fundamental

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,869
cruise for this trend or Malaysia's

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,420
ality activities and how to secure this

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,849
Audi device either

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,880
oh the Chinese saying know yourself and

51
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,390
know you're an anime and the you will

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,480
never be defeated it so firstly we

53
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,140
deployed honeypot analyzed under go

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,440
under attack - case under study known

55
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,660
attack report trying to understand how a

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:25,859
virtual ability are explained by

57
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:28,200
adversary' our honeypot including real

58
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,579
oddity devised and estimated out a

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:35,780
device for collecting real-world attack

60
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:38,609
activities the red figure shows the

61
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,000
infrastructure of our real device

62
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:45,660
honeypot to increase this device IP

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,079
diversity will entropies across from

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,220
different country as real a host for you

65
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:56,130
shouted device when our an attack

66
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,040
connect to Olivia's we redirect this

67
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:02,190
request to the related IOT device and

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,168
the Ford Edge response back to the

69
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,849
attacker

70
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:11,700
each simulated honeypot is a HTTP server

71
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:14,250
whose default configuration such as

72
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,339
default page under the HDTV recent

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:22,680
response body help be modified to

74
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:27,289
simulate the real out device from May to

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:34,800
July in 2008 a our handheld geyser

76
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:41,190
about 190,000 HTTP requests from

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:44,430
four thousand at least across 175

78
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:48,750
countries by analyze this traffic we

79
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:53,039
identify nearly 2,000 algae affluent

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:59,819
attempts from sex a different country

81
00:04:53,039 --> 00:05:01,199
more importantly there are only 164

82
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,460
unknown requests

83
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:09,780
aboard slowed by arahant out young F we

84
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:13,650
assume other unknown requests are from

85
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,969
unknown security force less than 10% of

86
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:22,039
the total attack exhaust to our honeypot

87
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:26,990
as such unknown attacks in other words

88
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:33,180
more than 90% of the malicious attack I

89
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:36,270
stones the normal abilities to validate

90
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,080
the Phantom made from Hannah code we

91
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,960
folder and ice for underground attack

92
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,389
tokens and the six well document LG

93
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,479
botnet the transition own normal impetus

94
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:57,050
also access is in underground attack

95
00:05:51,479 --> 00:06:02,669
talkies and known ouch attack activities

96
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:05,669
this attack strips also public allow in

97
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:09,930
the world birthday report making those

98
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:13,258
normal impolitic is led to a point in

99
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,520
the meantime the advisories realized our

100
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:21,449
well documentary LT rip out also kill as

101
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:25,680
the new opportunity for medicating these

102
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:28,110
streets from similar ability we can also

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,289
extract the warren beatty specific

104
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:35,159
information to form a protection

105
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:39,479
signature that stop our attack under all

106
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:42,870
ability so in our research we propose

107
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:46,050
outer shell and automatic toys that

108
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,480
collect actual impelliteri reports from

109
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,510
the internet analyzed and

110
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,420
coward Zack a knowledge to film world

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:58,010
beta specifics in nature these

112
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:01,620
signatures can be easily your steam

113
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:04,070
exciting ideas and wealth to detect

114
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:10,110
exponent attempts

115
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:12,960
this slide shows the architecture of IOT

116
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,720
shell which has three major components

117
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,140
debt collection altivo ability

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,620
extraction automatic production

119
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:25,200
generation debt collection is to use two

120
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,020
colors will imperative report from the

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,599
internet the actual ability attraction

122
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,969
is used to attract out your ability

123
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,870
information from a large number of

124
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:39,810
documents including the forms plugs and

125
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,780
mail lists the signature signature

126
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,090
generation you'll strike the information

127
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,239
and the woolen palette in semantics to

128
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,239
identify all the attack related attacks

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,770
surface which helped us to form a wall

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,530
and built a specific second occurs our

131
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:03,750
crawler is implemented by scrappy

132
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,400
framework we run our crawler across 30

133
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,970
William built a rapport of assets

134
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,810
including forms mailing list and some

135
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,160
Warren Beatty

136
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:17,280
a cave obsessed over the documentary

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,650
collected by our crawler our actual

138
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,619
Delta extraction first remove the

139
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,239
textual information I'm related to out

140
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,270
Europe out such ad adore Testaments

141
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,659
navigation bar well only keeps the main

142
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,348
content of the usual page after the

143
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,900
professors will still need to share out

144
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,300
the documentary and related to the

145
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,949
Warren Beatty reports which is down

146
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:49,530
axial force the first is the person

147
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:54,540
jurisdiction Ward since a rel will made

148
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:57,180
he reported always include an amount on

149
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,599
um textual information the second is a

150
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,040
number of hyperlinks an actual ability

151
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,860
reporte is not

152
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,759
supposed to include too many hyperlinks

153
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,550
otherwise it could be a summary for all

154
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,160
the world and birthdate is closed

155
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,019
instead or specific will pellet any

156
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,170
report with the detail will embed the

157
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,560
informations to evaluate the performance

158
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,370
of these two heuristic way randomly same

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,219
to 100 a documentary being discarded and

160
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,589
menu check later results

161
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,250
Waveland are all the same for the

162
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:38,610
documentary I'm related to Lt Warren

163
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:44,209
Beatty reports let's say the false

164
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:46,009
positive is zero necked it's audible

165
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,560
Invitational generation

166
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:51,649
ultimately always include some out in

167
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,199
the day and the wall embedded in it a

168
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:58,649
the strength way to identify this IOT

169
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,680
entity as to use key words and the

170
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,279

use the regular expression to attract

174
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:16,589
the product name I was attacked two

175
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:21,589

178
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,469
this out antennas due to high false

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:41,310
the product name in - totally when this

182
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:45,029

193
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:18,589
satisfying the rule about but as now

194
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:22,399
I'll cheat us an today to suppress false

196
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,600
most specifically we search for the

attractor entity in Google and then

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,420
calculated a similarity Pitons of a

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:45,740
which are traffic log from exposure on

218
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:48,589
this wall birthday IOT will embed LG

219
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,439
shelled first locus the Warren Beatty's

220
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:56,000
man takes in this direction for instance

221
00:12:51,439 --> 00:13:00,139
the sentence command injection in Pete

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,540
ability ERP decision in teks that Warren

223
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:06,769
Beatty type it's the command injection

224
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:11,269
and the affected location it's the

225
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:14,750
pathology the CTA together with Warren

226
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,660
Beatty permits from another sentence the

227
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,180
username password and the group

228
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,219
parameters we can also identify the

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,300
world beta parameters a username

230
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:29,600
password and group ouch

231
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,630
then I'll show them purse the structure

232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:38,000
information and the deep scour the pace

233
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:42,490
a wall and all CGI and the parameters

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,490
use the truth for command injection

235
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:52,180
further from the sentence about two

236
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:56,150
other vulnerable parameters the username

237
00:13:52,180 --> 00:14:01,130
password and the group parameters we can

238
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:05,390
infer that the same we can infer that

239
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:09,290
the same injection can also happen you

240
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:12,920
eyes are and the GRP but not on the

241
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:16,219
parameters action and left him in this

242
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,040
way we can build a wall beta specific

243
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,520
signature for the injection for the

244
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,339
injection force and then transform it to

245
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,319

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,589
one rule generation we can say the data

280
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,520
collection caused us the most tape over

281
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:47,670

283
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:55,170
practice to further evaluate the

284
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,949
performance our LT showed in an IDs

researcher interview to snowed weights

288
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:16,020
and without outer shell for the snowed

289
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:19,948
with outer shell it only as 0.13 second

290
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,810
focused inspection they showing that

291

outer shell in toast

292
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:28,438
later over high through the ideas for

293
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:30,540
Alan data process finally would conclude

294
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,090
our work new discovery

295
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,830
virtual ability are public available

296
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,639
under easily to a point

297
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:42,149
and today's out attack on osseous dual

298
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,590
ability for mounting Malaysia attack our

299
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,110
funding lead to the design our G sharp a

300
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,580
simple but effective

301
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:55,030
LT will beta specific signature

302
00:17:51,580 --> 00:18:04,629
raishin system for ideas which raised

303
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:09,820
the bar for out your attack thank you we

304
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:12,100
have time probably one question all

305
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,790
right it'll be my question then so you

306
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,139
focus on the HTTP vulnerabilities here

307
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,180
what percentage of the vulnerabilities

308
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,190
you actually found where HTTP based or

309
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:31,090
they tended to be in other protocols as

310
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:33,400
well okay by analyze the outer about we

311
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,540
found that most of the actual embedded

312
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:42,430
is about other activities or and there

313
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:49,210
is later about the kernel and other

314
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:57,330
vilambit a so our attacker report it's

315
00:18:49,210 --> 00:19:00,850
about the IPTV attack so we chose the

316
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,629
actually appear on boat to identify okay

317
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,070
thank you

318
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:09,010
let's take thanks from one last time

319
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,010
[Applause]
