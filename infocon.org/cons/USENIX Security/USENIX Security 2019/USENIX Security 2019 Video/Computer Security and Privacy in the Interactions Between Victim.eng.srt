1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,459
I'm Christine Chen from the Allen school

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,990
and I'm really grateful to get to share

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,330
with you today about work I did in

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,400
collaboration with Nicki Dell at Cornell

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,098
Tech and francie.rose nur at the Allen

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,849
school on victim service providers and

7
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:27,869
human trafficking survivors to jump

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,199
right in and want to give a little

9
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,400
context around human trafficking

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,489
fundamentally human trafficking is when

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,010
perpetrators or traffickers exploit

12
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,940
vulnerable individuals most commonly via

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,440
sexual exploitation or forced labor and

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,540
in the u.s. human trafficking has been

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,390
found everywhere from construction and

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,780
restaurants to bars and strip clubs and

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,420
massage parlors to give you a visual

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,000
this is what Polaris and anti

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,170
trafficking nonprofit that runs the

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,890
National Human Trafficking hotline

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,500
created to show the concentration of the

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,170
eight thousand potential cases of human

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,840
trafficking that they encountered in

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,700
2017 you can see that we're sitting in

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,590
this band of high activity along the

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,030
West Coast running from Canada to Mexico

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,640
so thinking more specifically about

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,320
technology and human trafficking prior

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,090
work has shed light on the ways that

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,270
technology is used in recruiting and

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,490
controlling sex trafficking victims and

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,759
then work by porting off at all and

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,080
folks in the DARPA Memex program has

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,970
developed technology to aid

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,890
investigators and discovering sex

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,050
trafficking activity which helps in

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,630
removing victims from these situations

38
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,670
and just to give some context the blue

39
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,860
arrow indicates a state change so from

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,600
victim to survivor in this case and then

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,130
the gray arrow is indicating

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,649
interactions so here between the

43
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,140
trafficker and the victim and this is a

44
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:59,400
simplification but I hope it gives a

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,310
sense for the entities in the space so

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,290
as I continue to dig I began to learn

47
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,270
that when a victim is rescued or is able

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,610
to escape or leave a trafficking

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,590
situation that's far from the end of the

50
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,870
story

51
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,459
so for one the trafficker might actively

52
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,769
be trying to find the survivor for the

53
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,290
purposes of revitalization or to

54
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,940
retaliate but apart from the trafficker

55
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,470
there's a whole host of other forces

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,130
that are pulling on the survivor that I

57
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,920
wish they had time to go into

58
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:31,690
things like drugs psychological trauma

59
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,549
and brainwashing economics etc and to

60
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,320
try to help the survivor counter these

61
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,870
forces there is the victim service

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,880
provider or VSP on the front lines

63
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,220
providing resources such as temporary

64
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,650
shelter help with employment and legal

65
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,630
issues and mental health support and it

66
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,150
helps to think of this as a great

67
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,010
tug-of-war between the VSP and the

68
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,880
survivor and the trafficker and those

69
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,890
other forces that I mentioned so now

70
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,680
that I had this picture I started to

71
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,059
wonder how does technology affect

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,220
survivors of trafficking in this tug of

73
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,590
war and what are their computer security

74
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,540
and privacy needs and ultimately I

75
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,580
decided to start off by talking to the

76
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,100
BSP the folks who are on the frontlines

77
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,630
supporting survivors because they have a

78
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,489
broad perspective on the human

79
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,540
trafficking ecosystem and the various

80
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:22,240
challenges that survivors face so for

81
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,130
today's talk I want to focus on the

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,990
following questions first of all what

83
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,820
are the technology related threats that

84
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,550
BSP and their clients are concerned

85
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,799
about and then how are they currently

86
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,060
mitigating those threat and why do we

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,920
want to know about these things it's

88
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,900
because we want to know what our role as

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,130
computer security researchers is in

90
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,180
supporting DSPs and trafficking

91
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,980
survivors so before I get to the results

92
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,580
I want to briefly talk about methodology

93
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:56,290
our study was declared exempt by the

94
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:58,360
u-dub IRB we recruited four BSP staff

95
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,940
members and we had a total of 17

96
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,200
participants primarily from the US and

97
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,340
they represent 11 different

98
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,230
organizations four of our participants

99
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,110
are survivors of sex trafficking and we

100
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,760
did not directly recruit for survivors

101
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,110
but some of the advocates are also

102
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,589
survivors and they shared about the

103
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,940
study with their survivor networks four

104
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,798
of our participants are currently

105
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,540
working with labor trafficking survivors

106
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,210
and I just want to note that limitation

107
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,040
so 13 out of 17 of our participants are

108
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,260
primarily serving sex trafficking

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,760
survivors so then we did interviews we

110
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,630
did semi structured qualitative

111
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,520
interviews

112
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,350
asking our participants about their

113
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,150
experiences with technology and their

114
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,470
interactions with clients and you can

115
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,840
find the protocol in our paper for the

116
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,340
analysis we generated a set of codes or

117
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,469
themes by reviewing interview

118
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,599
transcripts and then with these codes we

119
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,770
were able to organize the raw interview

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,330
transcripts into our results so moving

121
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,010
on to results to reiterate in this

122
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,200
section I want to give a sense for the

123
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,670
technology related threats that VSPs and

124
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,860
their clients are concerned about and

125
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,700
how they are mitigating those threats

126
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,440
and the really big takeaway here is that

127
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,140
technology safety is challenging for VSP

128
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,870
DSPs because they want to keep their

129
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,740
clients safe and this is from a holistic

130
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,440
standpoint so thinking physical safety

131
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,940
technology safety etc but they have to

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,370
balance this with other important

133
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,490
factors that may be at odds with safety

134
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,010
and I will be highlighting these factors

135
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,780
in blue boxes as we go along so look out

136
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,640
for those so to understand the threats

137
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,080
that VSPs and their clients are facing

138
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,539
we first need to understand how they're

139
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,180
interacting and in the paper identify

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,400
three main types of interactions there's

141
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,490
first contact so how did the survivor

142
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,989
get in touch with the VSP and then

143
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,070
there's shelter and safety planning so

144
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,070
some of these VSPs

145
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,700
provide short-term or long-term shelter

146
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,280
for survivors a safe place to stay and

147
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,380
then this kind of like the bread and

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,150
butter of VSP is a safety planning where

149
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,980
an advocate sits down with a survivor

150
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,549
and together they come up with a plan to

151
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,050
help the survivor feel safe and this is

152
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,820
much like threat modeling in the

153
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,530
computer security and privacy world like

154
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,240
who is the adversary what are the

155
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,049
adversaries capabilities how do we

156
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,270
defend against those capabilities the

157
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,130
third main interaction is VSP is

158
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,070
connecting survivors to resources and

159
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,540
referrals and for the purpose of today's

160
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,860
talk I'm going to focus on shelter and

161
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,360
safety planning because it gives a good

162
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,650
snapshot of the most important findings

163
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,940
so let's talk about some of the threats

164
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,520
that we found in this study one of the

165
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,800
threats that we heard about was

166
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,400
traffickers recruiting survivors

167
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,710
actively seeking to

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,380
victimized so we heard about traffickers

169
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,330
physically hanging out near the bsp to

170
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,550
recruit survivors as they go in and out

171
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,430
we heard about traffickers sending

172
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,110
victims to infiltrate VSPs and recruit

173
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,160
other survivors currently receiving

174
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,080
services we also heard about tracking

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,180
which is no stranger to the security and

176
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,099
privacy community so some examples we

177
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,979
heard about traffickers putting GPS

178
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,460
trackers on survivors cars bring traffic

179
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:20,590
tracking apps on phones utilizing

180
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:24,729
government records like DMV records to

181
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:27,219
find the survivors new address we also

182
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:29,710
heard about compromised communication

183
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,580
and this is not hard because often time

184
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,198
that trafficker has account credentials

185
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,060
and one final thought I want to mention

186
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
here is online triggers and this is kind

187
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,110
of unique and it has several facets one

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
facet we heard from some of our

189
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,100
participants that sex trafficking

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,770
survivors who are still friends on

191
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,930
social media with anyone in sex work

192
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,180
whether voluntarily or not are going to

193
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,810
be seeing triggers constantly of their

194
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,560
past life and past exploitation and

195
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,300
hand-in-hand with that we heard from

196
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,889
advocates who were worried about all the

197
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,630
gunk that their underage clients might

198
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,830
stumble across on the internet that

199
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:08,590
would remind them of their past

200
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:10,570
exploitation so with that as the

201
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,159
backdrop let's talk about mitigations

202
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,810
and let's talk first about the shelter

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,789
and shelter technology rules that we

204
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,080
heard about from our participants that

205
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,030
they used to try to protect their

206
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,659
clients and the confidentiality of the

207
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,260
shelter location something heard about

208
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,449
was no photos or videos in a shelter and

209
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,070
p-1 said the following quote we have to

210
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,800
think about all our clients in their

211
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,599
privacy especially we say if you're

212
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,579
taking a photo somebody could be walking

213
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,140
behind you and you've reached their

214
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,560
privacy because somebody could know who

215
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,630
they are and quote and that goes hand in

216
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,729
hand with refraining from posting on

217
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,500
social media so if you think about if

218
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,390
you post on social media and you

219
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,450
accidentally have locations serve

220
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,220
location tagging on well now you've just

221
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,750
revealed your location and the shelter's

222
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,910
location and then we also heard about

223
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,720
rules for using technology provided by

224
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,660
the shelter and the

225
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,759
says primarily computers so @p threes

226
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,529
organization clients can set up email

227
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,670
accounts for employment but they're told

228
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,220
outright that they're not private

229
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,839
meaning the Advocate can check the email

230
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,269
account if there's cause to believe that

231
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,430
it's being used for purposes other than

232
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,300
employment like maybe the survivors

233
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,709
communicating with the trafficker and

234
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,170
among organizations we talked with that

235
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,268
work with younger clients we heard about

236
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,219
things like checking the browser history

237
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:32,860
having an adult sit with the client when

238
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,379
the client is browsing the Internet even

239
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,990
thought about installing software just

240
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:40,959
to be able to know what's going on on

241
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,699
the computer and I want to note that for

242
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,859
some of the organizations that work with

243
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:46,750
younger clients they will even have

244
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,439
their clients check in personal devices

245
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,209
upon entry to the shelter and that leads

246
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:55,560
to the first tension which is between

247
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:58,959
client safety and ubiquity of Technology

248
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,969
p14 said quote if we deprive them of

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,008
that technology they're going to do it

250
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,689
behind our back they're gonna find a way

251
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,579
to get a burner phone they're gonna find

252
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:08,800
a way and a friend and whatever to get a

253
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,079
phone whether we endorse it and give

254
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,758
them a safe way to do it or whether we

255
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,290
let them do it behind our backs and

256
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,709
potentially risk all of us

257
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,719
end quote and that goes hand-in-hand

258
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,699
with another tension which is between

259
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,160
client safety and building trust and

260
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:26,410
autonomy we heard from our participants

261
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,500
that a VSP that's too strict in terms of

262
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:34,509
rule enforcement is basically like

263
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,920
another trafficker to the client so

264
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:39,970
let's talk a little bit about safety

265
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,469
planning mitigations and here I want to

266
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,139
share what one of our survivor

267
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,970
participants said about the type of

268
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:47,589
safety planning that might be necessary

269
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,949
to mitigate some of the threats that we

270
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:53,170
talked about earlier she says quote some

271
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:56,559
people they need to create a whole new

272
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,029
social media everything change their

273
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,029
phone number and email address and they

274
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,839
need to just like literally disappear

275
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,149
that means that your accounts are

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,769
completely 100% locked down and you have

277
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,170
pseudonyms and you don't use your face

278
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:09,939
in any pictures that you post you never

279
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,250
post your location you don't have

280
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:13,870
location turned on on your phone you get

281
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,600
a brand new phone because you don't know

282
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,819
what kind of

283
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,949
truckers there are and quote so that's a

284
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:23,750
little bit of what we heard in terms of

285
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:26,359
safety planning that involves locking

286
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,220
down arming up turning off location

287
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,839
services but there were also some

288
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,550
surprises so p2 said quote we've had

289
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,569
some clients who want their location

290
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,729
services on so that I can use my iPhone

291
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,680
and find them if something goes south or

292
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,120
to get an uber sent to them in a crisis

293
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,638
or whatever the case may be

294
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,420
they want us to be able to track them

295
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,130
and quote and this is where it's like

296
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,370
this is the messy real world and this is

297
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,410
what folks do to stay alive and it goes

298
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,620
back to this tension between client

299
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,959
safety and building trust and autonomy

300
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:05,060
p15 said quote because I always bring up

301
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,130
to people you probably should turn off

302
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,989
location on your phone but I do kind of

303
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,550
leave it up to them it's not mandatory

304
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,470
that they turn it off because we come

305
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,420
from an empowering place we don't want

306
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,579
to be telling them what to do and quote

307
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,500
and like we just heard in some cases

308
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:24,500
actually turning on location services

309
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,329
may make the client safer one final

310
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,639
tension I want to touch on today is

311
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,939
between client safety technology

312
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,980
accessibility but for the client and

313
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:37,699
maintaining contact between the VSP and

314
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,439
the client so we found in Prior work has

315
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:41,389
made it clear that abusers are commonly

316
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:44,329
accessing their victims Facebook

317
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,889
accounts still for a number of our

318
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:48,649
participants the benefits of using

319
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:50,000
social media Facebook in particular to

320
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,949
communicate with clients seem to

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,079
outright outweigh the risks ptoo said

322
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,899
the following quote a client right now

323
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:03,469
has a phone it's not connected to any

324
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,329
service but she can connect to Wi-Fi so

325
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,759
she and I can use facebook Messenger

326
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,399
instead of texting that's true for a lot

327
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,310
of our clients because phones get turned

328
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,769
off and on all the time numbers change

329
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,529
all the time I can still reach them on

330
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,810
facebook on facebook Messenger you can

331
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:24,439
log in to any computer or any phone to

332
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:27,649
access it and quote no less you think

333
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:28,250
that VSP is a new client just blindly

334
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,770
accept

335
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,810
that come with communicating this way it

336
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,760
was really fascinating to see how these

337
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,619
folks develop their own security

338
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,760
mechanisms on top of existing technology

339
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,770
we heard from several of our

340
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,960
participants that they use code words or

341
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,280
code phrases or security questions when

342
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,820
they're communicating with their clients

343
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,310
via social media or SMS and this is not

344
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,410
perfect but it's something that helps in

345
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,239
situations where the survivor is not

346
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,040
fully out of the trafficking situation

347
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,230
and the Advocate needs to make sure that

348
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,089
the person they're communicating with is

349
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:07,280
not the trafficker impersonating the

350
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:09,620
survivor so now that we've seen how BSP

351
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,569
and clients mitigate threats and the

352
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,870
various issues that they must juggle I

353
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,920
want to talk briefly about some

354
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,330
opportunities for technologists and

355
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,010
computer science researchers so here are

356
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,620
some technical directions that we think

357
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,960
might be fruitful to explore given what

358
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,940
we just talked about baking security

359
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,760
mechanisms for this population into

360
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,190
popular messaging tools thinking about

361
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,780
how do we support a semblance of secure

362
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,940
communication within compromised

363
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,640
accounts where the adversary has access

364
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,530
thinking about like a hidden secondary

365
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,270
messaging interface plausible

366
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:49,670
deniability etc how do we support safe

367
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,370
technology use in the shelter going back

368
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,229
to what that one participant said how do

369
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,120
we give folks a safe way to use

370
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,770
technology rather than doing it behind

371
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,420
our backs and risking all of us and one

372
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,339
other opportunity I want to mention here

373
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,750
is providing defenses for survivors

374
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:08,270
against public records and people

375
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,010
finding services and the paper we talk

376
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,079
about the shortcomings of the existing

377
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,230
mechanism for survivors to protect their

378
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,660
public records and this is important not

379
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,610
only for survivors of trafficking but

380
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,719
also because these services can be used

381
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,520
to facilitate stocking and daxing and I

382
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,170
just want to acknowledge that these are

383
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,860
high level and I really wish I could

384
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:34,010
give more detailed technical plans but

385
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,100
this is really hard because there's a

386
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,750
lot of different goals and they're

387
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,689
sometimes contradictory like we just

388
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,439
heard in the Keene

389
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:45,299
so the question I'm currently wrestling

390
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:46,618
with that I think summarizes these

391
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,119
different tensions that I've talked

392
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:51,569
about and is really crucial and moving

393
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:53,459
forward is how do we create or modify

394
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,889
technology to support and empower

395
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:58,649
survivors without boxing in and

396
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,419
suffocating and the best way to approach

397
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,149
this not surprisingly is to prioritize

398
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,759
input from and partnership with the VSPs

399
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,379
and survivors themselves so I just want

400
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,559
to leave you that leave you with this

401
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:12,149
from p14 who says quote getting advice

402
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,919
from the people who are using the

403
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,169
technology that y'all are creating is a

404
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,059
big part of moving forward because the

405
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,949
moment y'all stop listening to those of

406
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,439
us who are on these frontlines using

407
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:24,059
this technology to help the moment that

408
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,040
that stops happening is the moment that

409
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,519
you all stop growing and being effective

410
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,108
and quote so take that from the folks on

411
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,910
the frontlines thank you so much for

412
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:36,149
your time and listening to their needs I

413
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:39,809
want to acknowledge my co-authors and

414
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:43,049
the participants who were so crucial to

415
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:45,358
making this study a success and really

416
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:48,809
glad that their voices were able to be

417
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:51,529
heard today so thank you and I'd be

418
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,529
happy to take questions

419
00:16:51,860 --> 00:17:04,849
[Music]

420
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:06,140
I would just like you to state your name

421
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,899
and affiliation before you ask the

422
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,089
question nope

423
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,490
Tom Wriston Park - Cornell Tech very

424
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,750
nice work so I know you said you didn't

425
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,939
have much representation on the labor

426
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,020
trafficking but was there any notable

427
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:23,890
kind of distinct differences in terms of

428
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,379
Technology issues for that demographic

429
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,660
yeah that's a great question so I think

430
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:33,370
the first thing that comes to mind is

431
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:38,090
that for the labor trafficking survivors

432
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:41,168
we heard a lot about low tech literacy

433
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:45,320
and that really hurting the survivors so

434
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:48,140
we heard about survivors who were like

435
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,000
oh yeah my trafficker created my

436
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,919
Facebook account for me and he was just

437
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,049
being so kind because he wanted me to

438
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,320
stay in touch with my family but not

439
00:17:54,049 --> 00:18:00,379
realizing what that really meant and we

440
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,549
also heard about survivors and

441
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,040
documented survivors who they were just

442
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:09,620
so desperate when they got out of the

443
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,690
situation that they're like well the

444
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:17,149
person who knows how to get jobs for

445
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,950
people like me as my trafficker so I

446
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,710
guess I'll just go back and ask that

447
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,360
person and it was just like a cycle and

448
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,650
so those are the first two things that

449
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,530
come to mind thanks for that question

450
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,900
drew Davidson University of Kansas so I

451
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,520
wanted to start by saying this is a

452
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,830
really great talk and I think really

453
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,570
important work so thanks for that let me

454
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:44,899
fix this my question was all these

455
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,200
defenses that you saw to what extent

456
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,270
were they like actually really

457
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,740
meaningful and useful defenses and did

458
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,320
you find anything that was just sort of

459
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,210
creating a false sense of security but

460
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,950
maybe not actually that helpful in

461
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:04,419
practice yeah thanks that's a great

462
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,419
question so

463
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,740
there's a couple different things in

464
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:16,910
there but I think to answer one of those

465
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:20,000
it was really some of the ad-hoc

466
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:24,720
defenses so what I talked about with

467
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,820
communicating DSPs and clients

468
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,740
communicating via social media or SMS

469
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,429
where they implemented their own

470
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,430
security mechanisms where they were like

471
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,560
this is really helpful and we know this

472
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,420
is doing something like because I'm

473
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,919
using this security question I know that

474
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,600
the person I'm talking with right now is

475
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:48,240
the client and not the trafficker and

476
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,340
that's where I got the sense that folks

477
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,300
were like this is actually doing

478
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:57,350
something when they're able to tailor

479
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,899
things to the particular situation

480
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,760
Thanks actually I think we're gonna move

481
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,210
on to the next book thank you so much

482
