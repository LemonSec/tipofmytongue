00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,219
hello everyone this is hojin today I'd

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,500
like to talk about operating LT signal

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,980
in

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,420
physical layer which is called a

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,140
physical signal overshadowing attack on

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,200
LTE this is a joint work with sang min

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,340
Cho hoon a professor song me and my

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:35,730
adviser young day or from Christ as all

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,070
we know LTE is everywhere it is so wise

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,769
that sometimes I feel like it is

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,199
impossible to live without their energy

12
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:46,019
in addition to basic services such as

13
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:51,769
post or data LT also supports some

14
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:51,769
special services such as emergency SMS

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,890
before getting into the tip before

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,379
getting into the details of my problem

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,129
let me explain the RT LT architecture

18
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,739
first which consists of access network

19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,440
the wires link between the UE and base

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,590
station and the core network the wire

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,130
network supporting mobility

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:17,039
authentication and data service among

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,560
this we focused on access network the

24
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:22,350
excess metal is wireless meaning that it

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,360
deployed security to avoid it dropping

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,658
or interference fortunately most of the

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,939
messages in LT are integrate protective

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,259
after the U is the UE is authenticated

29
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:40,380
authenticated to the network by sharing

30
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,210
circuit context but how about the

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,789
messages before the authentication of

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,610
course they are not secure one of those

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,710
messages is called broadcast message

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,409
which have never been interviewed

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:57,119
protected in all generations of mobile

36
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,759
communication so they are vulnerable so

37
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,820
while it's broadcast message it be first

38
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,820
messages sent to multiple us within a

39
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,149
cell at the same time messages such as

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,910
paging or SIV are included in the

41
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,799
broadcast message paging is sent by the

42
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,430
core network to establish a connection

43
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:21,180
with the UE si B contains various

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,310
information about a cell so the

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,940
broadcast message is not integrated

46
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:31,040
protective then how can an attacker send

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,590
a malicious broadcast message to the UE

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,790
the most popular way is is to use

49
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,600
so-called

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,959
fake base station fps in short in

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,680
cellular communication Yui people's base

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,020
station with stronger signal so FPS

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,470
transmit a stronger signal to attract

54
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:55,260
the Yui once the Yui is attached to the

55
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,970
fake base station it can send malicious

56
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,739
broadcast messages to the Yui fake base

57
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,520
station needs a connection establishment

58
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,440
to send the unprotect messages but do

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,860
you think this is the most general way

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,690
to exploit the unprotected message or do

61
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,110
we really need connection establishment

62
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,930
in my opinion the most generic exploit

63
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,600
is physically overwriting the wireless

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:27,600
signal over the air called civil war

65
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:31,380
death let me explain what the cigarette

66
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,290
leg is in the example here cell tower is

67
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,209
broadcasting unprotected messages with

68
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,179
saw frames in different time and

69
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,120
frequency if an attacker can precisely

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,000
operate a second sub frame so that the

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,510
Yui can decode register frames instead

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,330
of blue so frame we call it sigil attack

73
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,870
as you can see this idea does not

74
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,180
require connection establishment while

75
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,700
the idea looks simple it is not revered

76
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,340
to design and implement figaro tech for

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:08,010
LTE the challenges and questions include

78
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,040
first which part of the signal is

79
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,100
overshadowed second how to synchronize

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,130
time and frequency third how much access

81
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:22,010
is required for a malicious message to

82
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:26,010
be decoded properly first question is

83
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,810
granularity of overshadowing well but

84
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,289
let you look at the LT frame structure

85
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,169
first our LT frame consists of multiple

86
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,830
Supremes and so a soft frame has

87
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,990
multiple symbols and a message is

88
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,359
included in a soft frame meaning that

89
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,510
there are various options to be

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,550
overshadowed

91
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,490
simple level overshadowing requires

92
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,390
precise synchronization so successfully

93
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:55,330
is hard to guarantee on the other hand

94
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,599
frame revolution requires to rewrite

95
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,659
multiple saw frames or multiple messages

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,910
so it is quite natural to overshadow in

97
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:09,880
the soft frame level now let me explain

98
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,310
how I cryptid or malicious a frame that

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,969
can be successfully decoded at a bit

100
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,490
Kamui attacker puts her own pile of

101
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,880
symbols in the suffering to help the

102
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,760
victim decode the message properly this

103
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,250
addition of Pyla symbols increases

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,750
attack robustness against phase and

105
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,490
amplitude error and crept malicious for

106
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,430
encrypted malicious messages can now be

107
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:43,440
can now be included in various channels

108
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:43,440
such as PCF IC h pd c CH and pd SCH

109
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,310
earlier malicious of frame example is

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,530
here the led one is signal or logically

111
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,040
playstation and the blue one is the

112
00:05:53,530 --> 00:06:01,349
attackers as you can see tight time and

113
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,350
frequency synchronization is required

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,870
let's see time synchronization first

115
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,980
attacker cell frame and logicoma so

116
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,870
frame must arrive at the ue

117
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,900
simultaneously in order to override a

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,140
particular frame accurately for

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:24,130
simplicity let's assume that there is no

120
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:27,450
propagation delay for now the attacker

121
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,580
utilized synchronization signal called

122
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,860
psssss to get accurate time

123
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,169
synchronization because they are sent

124
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,010
period periodically from the legitimate

125
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:42,520
cell tower more concretely first thought

126
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,150
hacker listened to psssss to get frame

127
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,419
timing

128
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,630
overload roma sir meaning that total can

129
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:53,080
identify the frame timing T 0 T 1 and T

130
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:56,140
2 second once the attacker runs the

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,279
timing she can predict the timing of the

132
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,308
tracker so frame

133
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,849
because each surfing has fixed site

134
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:07,509
which is one millisecond for example if

135
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:12,039
the attacker overshadows second cell

136
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:15,399
frame or frame 566 then she can transmit

137
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:19,659
the malicious software at the T 2 + 1

138
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:22,149
millisecond now the attacker signals

139
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:25,529
arrives at the ue simultaneously since

140
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:29,139
we assume there is no propagation delay

141
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:31,269
but it in your life however there is

142
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,899
propagation delay depending on their

143
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:35,019
location

144
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:39,369
meaning that T 0 will be delayed due to

145
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:42,249
the propagation delay or psssss also if

146
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:46,419
the attacker is located far from the UE

147
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:48,789
more delay will be added the delay could

148
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:52,568
be compensated if the attacker precise

149
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:57,669
precisely locate the UE and Delta but it

150
00:07:52,569 --> 00:08:00,219
is not realistic in the wild the delay

151
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,679
is the delay is up to some maximum value

152
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:06,519
because they are they are located within

153
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:09,818
the cell radius so so yes in practice

154
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:13,089
there is a delay that cannot be

155
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,339
compensated so so frames cannot be on

156
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:20,819
line exactly

157
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:23,889
so then what we can count on the LT ue

158
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,069
LTE is designed to be reliable

159
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:29,739
especially in outer environment so we

160
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:32,469
expected that the UE would compensate

161
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:35,948
such small errors if the cell frame is

162
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,539
somewhat synchronized but not exactly so

163
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:40,750
the question is how much can the UE

164
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,120
tolerate this delay error since it is

165
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,819
chips app dependent we measure the max

166
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,329
delay tolerance of to cod smartphones

167
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:52,689
and lizard is around 12 and 11

168
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:56,199
microsecond each and both result exceeds

169
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:59,139
max delay of orbital which is around 8

170
00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:01,689
micro second so this means that the

171
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,449
attack can succeed regardless of the

172
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:07,540
location of the base station and the big

173
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:10,059
news in summary the attacker can be

174
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,449
anywhere within the cell to succeed

175
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,449
attack

176
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,570
the last one to solve is frequency

177
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,880
synchronization 3gpp specify the minimum

178
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:27,400
frequency accuracy that LTI base station

179
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,560
must have as 50 ppb so for precise

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,800
synchronization the attacker needs to

181
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,890
attack her need to use a sufficiently a

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,839
create frequency after that legendary

183
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:44,800
frequency error can be compensated by

184
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:47,500
siapro correction algorithm since the

185
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,279
Civil War was long was long on our

186
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,520
typical SDR software-defined radio we

187
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,160
keep doing an inaccurate oscillator we

188
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,560
adopt cheapest EO to improve its

189
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,900
frequency accuracy GPS do guarantee is

190
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,660
25 PPP frequency error frequency

191
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,230
accuracy without GPS antenna and 1 ppb

192
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,339
with GPS antenna lastly we can

193
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,770
compensate legendary frequency error by

194
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:20,950
psssss based the CFO corruption check

195
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:23,410
our paper for more details here's the

196
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,580
summary of main question and answers we

197
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,160
always shadow software units using

198
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,890
psssss for time synchronization and GPS

199
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,790
do and share protection for frequency

200
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,640
synchronization finally cautery is

201
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,910
generous - enough generous enough to

202
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,880
cover the entire urban air ensure no

203
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,910
tecar locate located on a cell can

204
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,080
overshadow broadcast messages to any big

205
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:55,900
team within the cell here's our test

206
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,360
environment we implement a civil way by

207
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:02,380
using open source as LT state which is

208
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,080
srs LT we use us artistries for radio

209
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,480
transmission we also verify the attack

210
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,250
against various smartphones such as

211
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,930
iPhone 10s or galaxy s 9 in the

212
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,779
remainder of this talk I will talk about

213
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,260
performance of sig / and attacks that

214
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:24,750
can be launched using silver all of

215
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,750
which were tested with these devices

216
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,000
okay so far I've shown I have shown that

217
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,400
civil can be used in practice but for

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,500
fake base station and civil can inject

219
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,530
malicious proof test messages to the UE

220
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,840
then what is the advantage of sig over

221
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:43,209
the basic advantage of civil were

222
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,000
compared with fake base station comes

223
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,400
from the fact that the civil does not

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,890
need connection establishment to inject

225
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,069
the message this has multiple

226
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,410
implications first power efficiency

227
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,570
Seagoville does not require strong power

228
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,490
because the or texting learn only needs

229
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,950
to be higher enough to cover the

230
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:07,300
original signal called kettle effect

231
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,960
it shows 98% success rate on 3 DB higher

232
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,329
power

233
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,570
however the fake base station requires

234
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,970
much stronger power than the silver this

235
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,100
is because the fake page station needs

236
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,810
to break the current connection between

237
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,890
the victim Mui and legitimate

238
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:26,469
PlayStation another advantage is that

239
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,689
the UE keeps communicating with the

240
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,290
logical implication or network during

241
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,650
the attack for example to see Goldberg

242
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:39,459
can inject a malicious message while the

243
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:42,430
victim U is on the phone however the UE

244
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,010
to not communicate with the network

245
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,829
after attaching to the fake base station

246
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,650
so the UE might fall in the denial of

247
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,720
services let me show you one possible

248
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:56,770
time using syllable but not feasible

249
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,090
using fake base station in general

250
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:02,680
signaling system occurs through a bundle

251
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:07,840
but the silver can launch the attack

252
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,479
without without using the banner the CEO

253
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,600
will exploit a broadcast message called

254
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,300
SIV one especially the tracking area

255
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,570
code but by changing the tracking area

256
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,089
code to do on the attacker can trigger

257
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:26,430
tracking area update procedure of the

258
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:29,110
BQE which is sent to the core network

259
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:32,140
all you easyness air may continuously

260
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,990
listable fake bait bait SIV one which

261
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,470
caused tracking area updated tome to the

262
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,200
coil network

263
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:44,050
fake playstation can do the same but as

264
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,630
you expected the legitimate network

265
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,000
would be safe from the attack because

266
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:53,650
the faith playstation is not connected

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,990
to the legitimate core network we

268
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,750
evaluate application factor of a signal

269
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:02,040
in stomata in normal situation or you'ii

270
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,830
send up a 45 service request message

271
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,920
responding to over 600 signaling

272
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,350
messages per hour signaling system using

273
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,160
silver can generate around

274
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,380
21k tracking area update request

275
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,610
responding to around 400 K signaling

276
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,810
messages per hour

277
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,700
in summary signaling system can generate

278
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:31,380
600 four times more signaling messages

279
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:31,380
per Yui I want to show you a demo video

280
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:40,540
the program in the screen shows

281
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:42,640
signaling messages of the Yui first toe

282
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,060
tag her inject a malicious paging

283
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,790
message this one is a is the malicious

284
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,550
paging message it is required for the

285
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:56,709
Yui to receive a new HIV one which is

286
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:59,109
fake then to attack her

287
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,300
oh boy shadows or malicious SIV moon

288
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,450
message who's tracking area code is

289
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:13,930
changed then the Yui generated signaling

290
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:19,960
to the network like this will keep going

291
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:26,530
so I skip this demo another demo video

292
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:27,760
about fake emergency alert message there

293
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:31,480
are two victims

294
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,089
PT Muys and we run the cigarette app to

295
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,810
send the fake emergency alert messaging

296
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,810
to the US

297
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,550
then

298
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,990
they'll receive the fake alert message

299
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,209
which is test message if you're

300
00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:01,709
interested please check our YouTube

301
00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:04,888
channel for more videos how about the

302
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:07,469
defense a civil war lies on a physical

303
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:10,649
layer one can consider physical layer

304
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,709
defense as shown here here we computed

305
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:17,639
call a correlation of channel magnitude

306
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:19,560
between consecutive sufferings but as

307
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,500
shown in the example of non-line of

308
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,349
sight environment which is the blue line

309
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,290
at the bottom figure it would be quite

310
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,660
difficult to detect the silver in the

311
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:36,029
physical layer when the attacker is

312
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:38,880
careful carefully adjust the power the

313
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:41,339
most secure solution against cyber

314
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,970
attack on broadcast message is to use

315
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,880
digital signature this is possible

316
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,220
because from 5g operators public key

317
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,240
will be stored in the ocean

318
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,040
in fact the dealer the digital signature

319
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,519
on broadcast message was previously

320
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,279
discussed in 3gpp but unfortunately

321
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,140
because of the various reasons this

322
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:09,569
direction is not standardized yet in

323
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,030
summary I present the Figueroa

324
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,899
physically operating specifics of frames

325
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:19,079
Segawa ism is a new exploit on unpatched

326
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,179
and insecure broadcast channel on LTE

327
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,569
compared to the attacks using fake base

328
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:27,480
station silver is much silver is cheaper

329
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,389
and stealthy also we found new attacks

330
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,630
on broadcast channel finally I expect

331
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,179
cigarette have to be used in the wild

332
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,309
therefore I strongly suggest 3gpp to use

333
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:42,510
digital signature for broadcast channel

334
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:45,780
despite its difficulty we every sport we

335
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,929
have this past plea disclose these

336
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,139
attacks GSMA an organization for

337
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:55,020
cellular carriers say this has no

338
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,570
practical implication as detected on the

339
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,139
other hand kurama's acknowledged their

340
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,340
vulnerability we found

341
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,320
we are currently thinking about making

342
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:16,919
the cigarette tab open source to push

343
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:20,309
3gpp thank you very much questions for a

344
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:23,130
speaker hey Aaron Schulman UC San Diego

345
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:25,049
so I love this attack I think this is a

346
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,980
better way of doing the cell broadcast

347
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:31,740
attack like we saw at Mobius this year

348
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,500
my question is you know we open up these

349
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,410
new set of attacks like attacking the

350
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,299
downlink scheduler so you can say that a

351
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,540
different schedule is coming to your

352
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:47,220
client than is actually legitimate but I

353
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:49,260
kind of agree with the 3gpp that it's

354
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,910
it's not obvious how that can cause

355
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,940
anything more than a denial of service

356
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,890
like do you see any potential firmware

357
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,710
vulnerabilities they're like what is the

358
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,990
potential Avenue of attack that you can

359
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:08,850
open beyond just denying service with

360
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:11,780
them actually I'll just jump in to

361
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,780
helping to answer

362
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:25,419
there are more attacks on the paper but

363
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:28,090
not described so other than the dinner

364
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,900
of services observing the advisor has to

365
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,149
jump in sometimes so so one of the way

366
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,550
so so we talked about the fake base

367
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,000
station nothing right and also you can

368
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:42,700
do people are thinking about MIT mo tag

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,430
as well and one of the things you can do

370
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:49,240
is using sick over actually you can

371
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:51,790
forcefully attach our victim phone to

372
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,250
the fake base station and that that's

373
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,800
you can make it really really sturdy

374
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:02,170
then it will be actually very difficult

375
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,700
to detect so I mean so that make sense

376
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,860
that's a cult act okay

377
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,570
so but we have not implemented it I

378
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:12,189
think there could be some technical

379
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:15,490
challenges but I think yeah I mean in

380
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:18,310
many countries actually like arterial or

381
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,520
there are people considering using LTE

382
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:24,070
for critical applications and if the

383
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,350
cell is down I think it may cause other

384
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,350
problems in IOT and other applications

385
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:33,719
so I even think the dinner service

386
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,719
uptake is a still problem thank you

387
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:49,800
okay okay I want to ask one question you

388
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:52,139
know come come flagship conflict outdoor

389
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,139
environment there are many high

390
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:59,160
buildings and many objects so there

391
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:05,160
exist much signal reflection and signal

392
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:08,910
this this fraction so it might I guess

393
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,630
it might may affect the come combination

394
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:19,440
of your attacker signal and signals

395
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:22,110
basis stations so in such case house how

396
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,500
is the success ratio we all attack due

397
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:29,209
to our experiments consider this to be

398
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,920
no reflection signal this fraction

399
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:36,330
secondary signal reflection

400
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:39,690
can you explain and signal reflection

401
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:43,169
and refraction so how I handled a signal

402
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:46,050
reflection question is correct

403
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,270
yeah he may be asking about things like

404
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,240
multipath fading multipath fading we we

405
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:55,050
put pilot symbols to hand to are

406
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,690
compared to multipath fading to to to

407
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:00,110
make to attack attacker signal to be

408
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,330
decoded at the victim properly we put

409
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,550
pala symbols in the suffering we put

410
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,560
pilot symbols so reflection does not

411
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,419
matter so fading and fading infecting

412
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,320
does BIA don't lie alongside line of

413
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:16,490
sight does matter

414
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,490
okay thank you let's thank our speaker

415
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,870
you
