1
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,230
good evening everyone thanks for

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,509
introduction start for today and I'm

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,759
vitro farmer university of Chinese

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,860
Academy of Science I'm really standing

5
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:23,200
here to present our reason to walk about

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,330
smart home security this is Rhonda

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,470
Walker operated by UCS with the CDN

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,330
University Penn State and UJ and so we

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,100
know although there's a increasing

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,110
number of smart home device try to

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,840
dominate our starboard space and has

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,360
clearly changed our lives as a DC

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,120
company forecast there will be more than

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,729
800 million smart home device only

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,280
shaping in this year so I think everyone

16
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:50,530
hair may ever use a smartphone device if

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,920
not I think you me mad at the wrong

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:58,629
track so to manage with this increasing

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,540
number LTE device just some several peer

20
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:04,989
companies lacquer smartisan like smarter

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:08,470
Google and I applaud just proposed smart

22
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,500
home platform so it just occurs about

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,658
how the IOT device works through the

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,510
interacting with the smartphone platform

25
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:19,510
and how the smartphone platform works

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:24,190
and we found typically there are three

27
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:26,320
entities LG cloud mobile device and the

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,710
mobile app transit interacts with each

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,020
other

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,259
you know real world smart home platform

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,020
so first address demonstrate how the

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,780
smartphone platform manager device and

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,199
provides several servers through the

34
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,230
three identities interactions first to

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,659
identify each device the IOT cloud need

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,570
to a sense a unique diversity to the

37
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,000
device to achieve that the IOT device

38
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,089
will first saneras unique information

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,729
like MAC address and device model to the

40
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,300
IOT cloud and out cloud will coordinate

41
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:06,100
this to to generate a device ID and send

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,649
back to the IOT device and next to Allah

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,319
to ensure the only device owner and

44
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:14,440
italica the user have access to is the

45
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,129
IOT device so user need to pound the

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,530
device before use it to achieve that the

47
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,510
IOT device will also send is a unique

48
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,830
identity information to the user

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,010
mobile app

50
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,890
the youth services credential ways in

51
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,040
which the device identity information to

52
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,730
the IOT cloud so the IOT cloud compound

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,940
is device ID with a user and next the

54
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,950
IOT cloud the transfer transfer device

55
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,370
login request and it's in pewter

56
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,200
connection with IOT device okay just

57
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,600
finish this is a you need staff

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,060
interactions so three identities of a

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,340
cable connection with each other at this

60
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,830
point the user can just normally use the

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,720
device for example again standard

62
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,900
control command to the IOT device

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,630
through the IOT cloud and the trial did

64
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,060
occur and out device will also upload

65
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,940
the is scheduled to the LT cloud and

66
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,360
alkyl cloud will transfer it to the user

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,480
and the user can also grab some average

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,480
III rules and to the article or an

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,820
erotic cloud will automatically send the

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,049
control command to the LD device then

71
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,359
the user defined rules are satisfied so

72
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,370
as we see the smart home platform was

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,739
really great just through the several

74
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,140
simple interaction requests the smart

75
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:39,160
home platform country will remove device

76
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,799
control user authentication device

77
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,880
authentication user organization and the

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,430
automation applications however we found

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,380
there are still some secrets problem of

80
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,950
three identities in the actions and

81
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,079
discovered so here a for sake example to

82
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,390
show what our our fondant is

83
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,850
contributing our substitution attack a

84
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,339
phenom device is the Java computer

85
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,920
program which have the same device

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,530
identity with the root device and we use

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,660
it to mimic some device in the actual

88
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,910
request for example imagine that you

89
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,899
know a smart home the victim has two

90
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,690
device of a fairer learn to detect Sigma

91
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:26,409
and a smartlock to control the door and

92
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:29,260
uh normally when the victim has upon

93
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,850
this device and so it an't is two device

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,289
which has a cable connection without a

95
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:37,210
cloud or to the victim and it's a when

96
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,719
normally when user tried to open the

97
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,369
door

98
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:41,649
he can send the open the lock to the

99
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:44,469
iot-cloud and I were to colada will

100
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:47,049
forward this command to the poodle smart

101
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:49,869
lock but no if we will use a fondant

102
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:52,179
device which has the similar identity

103
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:54,909
with the smart lock and it's a try to

104
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:57,308
login to the IOT cloud and the IOT cloud

105
00:04:54,909 --> 00:05:00,610
we will also build a connection with our

106
00:04:57,309 --> 00:05:04,269
phantom device so the victims command

107
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:08,529
will not forward to our fandom device as

108
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:11,559
a result that 3rd hacker can use that to

109
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:16,119
infer user victims hobbies like what a

110
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:18,669
time he can get or give the home even

111
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:21,219
worse you match that to in case of the

112
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,938
fire the victim mccr ever every rules

113
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:24,579
like that

114
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,169
if the lerm dick tag a sick move and

115
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,779
it's a he letter

116
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,808
LT cloud automatically open the open the

117
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:33,909
lock but no if videos of fundin device

118
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:36,909
transfer has assumed identity with the

119
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:39,188
smoke color and the user maintain

120
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:42,129
connection to send a fake column to a

121
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:45,969
declawed and article allah will also

122
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:47,889
open the lock and as we show now you

123
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:49,659
first come to your mind

124
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,179
maybe your single is the trans a simple

125
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,369
device or the location problem because

126
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:57,489
maybe the funding device has a some

127
00:05:54,369 --> 00:06:00,059
identities based the real device but the

128
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:03,248
way fun usually uses as a simple

129
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:07,059
precondition and their house still some

130
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:11,019
deep cause bill will cost this and next

131
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:13,300
I will show you for the evils iot-cloud

132
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:15,579
only fill to distinguish the root device

133
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,219
with the fundament of ice but how

134
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:21,059
everything else cred could our fund them

135
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:24,519
the funding to us attacker secure works

136
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:26,769
ok well the victim has bought this

137
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,929
device and a three identity strata cable

138
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:31,929
connection with each other at this

139
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:34,958
moment the user phenom device which has

140
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:37,058
the same identities of is elude us try

141
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,179
to login to the article odd but the

142
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:42,819
iot-cloud aware of either secure keep

143
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:44,919
the connection with the real device he

144
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,360
can easily just refuses request

145
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,440
so we sink the deep course maybe the

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,530
erotic laws not enforced

147
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,650
dragutin's data transfer measurement

148
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,890
okay so we try to analyze city because

149
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,229
for following these steps first of the

150
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,599
analyzing interaction message and it's a

151
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,870
we each try the state register mode Oh

152
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,330
Amanda three identities and we try to

153
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,150
identify it and causing I expect leaders

154
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,099
data transactions and the next betrayed

155
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,140
or abusing this expertise to the

156
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,310
transaction cameras terrorist attacks

157
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:25,190
and we test our funding of fair popular

158
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,140
smartphone platforms therapy emotion

159
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,650
were hired appealing device using these

160
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,229
platforms and this classroom also / also

161
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,380
products Muslim by sourcing kinds of LT

162
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:42,950
device produced by over 200 famous

163
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:45,230
device manufacturers okay before we can

164
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,530
analyzing the actions as we all know to

165
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,870
protect user privacy the smart home

166
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,510
platform usually equipped all the

167
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,760
communications so to analyze the

168
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,590
interaction message we first must to

169
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,460
decrypt the communication traffic at

170
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,510
first this is our first challenge and

171
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,000
according to different community

172
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,789
channels we just use different measure

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,590
to decrypt the communications and you

174
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,620
can check out the detail in our paper

175
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,739
and after we decrypt all the interaction

176
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,440
message and we can know the purpose of

177
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,720
each message and the term we could

178
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,710
distill a generally the transaction

179
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,040
model of three entities and among them

180
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,469
each age just each edge just dominating

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,890
interactions with the two other entities

182
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,349
which will cause estate transactions so

183
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,319
the three entities are not independent

184
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:42,080
but closely related to each other okay

185
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,089
now we just go back to see the three

186
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,089
identity interactions from a state

187
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:49,040
transaction veil at first the three

188
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,800
entities such as a young is a Unidos

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,930
working stays still one and it turns

190
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,870
wrote unit interactions the state will

191
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,510
transfer together and finally to three

192
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,880
energies before will failure to state

193
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:09,680
for and we will cabl the connection

194
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,870
and the unions is this however since we

195
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,069
can't arbitrarily change the request of

196
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:19,040
the route device so how can we just to

197
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:21,110
identify or invoke some expertise with

198
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,149
the transactions in this interaction

199
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:29,300
models to deal with that we just use a

200
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,269
phantom device a fundamental verse use

201
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,810
just to mimic the interact request but

202
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:38,389
you the consent and in your any

203
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:41,060
diversity request which has changed the

204
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:44,329
bass and the more iam hotend the funding

205
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,670
device we will not contrast a country we

206
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,269
will not give me see the better working

207
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,910
state either either concerned any device

208
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:56,420
will request no matter what the state of

209
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,600
the article owed and the mobile app so

210
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,240
just always have the funnel device we

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,509
can identify some design flaw which will

212
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,759
trigger the expertise data transactions

213
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:10,459
so I just demonstrated the first flaw we

214
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,279
found the fourth floor is iot-cloud

215
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,399
didn't destructively Carta is a working

216
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,680
state for example if the iot-cloud and

217
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,189
the device and mobile app are just

218
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,180
working at state for with fun we can use

219
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:27,860
a symptom as identity we can use the

220
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,439
fundamental bias to have the same

221
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,750
identity as a root device and the sender

222
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:35,540
device register required without a cloud

223
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,699
the IOT cloud will also accept this

224
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,099
request the even frizziness working

225
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:42,109
still for and the transfer came back

226
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,019
with the same device ID with the root of

227
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,269
s to our phantom device

228
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:49,939
similarly we found we also can't use the

229
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:52,880
fondant is to send device login request

230
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:54,889
in the young when the LT cloud working

231
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,430
in the steel floor and the fruit of mode

232
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:01,670
the IOT cloud and also to the chat it is

233
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,670
not check did not performance or an

234
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,500
addition check on this login request so

235
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:11,149
the funding device can transport the

236
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:14,510
connection with the IOT cloud and next i

237
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:18,529
will show how to use this floss to cause

238
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,930
some serious security hazards now

239
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:23,209
we just the first to replace our of

240
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,790
substitution attacks as I just

241
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:29,239
demonstrated at the beginning first

242
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,639
attacker tries to use the flow one to

243
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,569
register fundamental ice to care the SIM

244
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:38,480
device ID as a victim and now he can use

245
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:42,740
this device ID to log in the funding

246
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,930
device sir so iot-cloud will disconnect

247
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,420
the root device but just repeal the

248
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,420
connection with our funding device so

249
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,628
our funding device can open can cast to

250
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,790
victims of commands and just upload the

251
00:11:53,629 --> 00:12:00,949
figgety wasted use to misleading the

252
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:04,309
users and this table Trans Am race or

253
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:07,729
our attorney certified attacks and each

254
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:11,120
attacks just affect multiple platforms

255
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,610
and you totally have a successful her

256
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,670
daughter fell kinds of attacks including

257
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,470
remote device restitution as I just

258
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,559
showed before and the remote device

259
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:25,240
hijacking remove diversity doors illegal

260
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:29,120
diverse occupations and as a firm

261
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,509
received and a due to time limit we just

262
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,180
showed our tag to have a platform in

263
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:37,339
this Beach and the neck and for the

264
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,410
Romanian attacks and a dagger to tell

265
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,620
people at home please check out in our

266
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:46,250
paper and next I will show remote device

267
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,199
hijacking attack before I transit em

268
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,600
straight the device hijacking attack I

269
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,819
need to introduce another two design

270
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,850
flaw at first as we mentioned earlier

271
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:58,399
the three identities are not independent

272
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,339
but the close released other so for

273
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,800
example normal when normally when user

274
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,230
don't want to use this device he can

275
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,639
send abandon request and the reset

276
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,920
device at the same time

277
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,389
so the Alta cloud mobile app and the

278
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,569
device will Tran SPECT

279
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:16,699
to the initial stem and other symptoms

280
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:19,099
but in truth you may fall if user

281
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:21,620
transition the device and body requests

282
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,339
but forget to reset the device to

283
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,470
iot-cloud

284
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,290
and the mobile app will transfer to the

285
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,689
initial steps but IOT device will secure

286
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,339
in the working still for and he still

287
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:36,180
keep the connection without a cloud

288
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,980
and the even at this point our attacker

289
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,469
can send the device bonding request

290
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,840
without a cloud the LD cloud will accept

291
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,970
this request and send the bags at the

292
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,040
control panel to our attack and also

293
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,890
transfer to the working still flow and

294
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,069
and no three identities are obviously

295
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:55,160
the fraud but the ownership of the root

296
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,630
of s has given to the attacker and the

297
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,140
furthermore the LD divisor to keep the

298
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,820
connection with iot-cloud in addition we

299
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,189
also found that the device and burning

300
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,920
requests can also treat the as a device

301
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,290
set so the attacker can you'll also use

302
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,529
the following device to tor tray with

303
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,170
diverse and pending requests so no

304
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,910
address the thymus to treat our

305
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,829
developer changing attack this attack is

306
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,439
the chance to continue with a device a

307
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,140
petition attack after the some phantom

308
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,020
device has login the IOT cloud and a

309
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,720
beautiful without a cloud and fundaments

310
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,210
can send the unbounding request to the

311
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,130
other cloud and iot-cloud the adjuster

312
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,490
and binding this request with a victim

313
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:41,880
so at this point the attacker can't just

314
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,100
abandon the root of s and because it

315
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,030
route us to to keep the connection with

316
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,760
the LT Claus

317
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,620
so as this and at this point the

318
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,280
attacker can directly control the

319
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,920
victims device just as shown in this

320
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,560
figure after complete the device

321
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,660
hydrating attack the attacker just can

322
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,890
control the device through his device

323
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,600
control panel just like odds of victims

324
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,990
so the finale we just propose on

325
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,930
mitigation suggestions and extra fat boy

326
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,030
you can figure it out like a carry out

327
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,089
most tracker device other occasions or

328
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,850
comprehend some organizations and wave

329
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:25,070
on to Ambersons that is used to enforce

330
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:29,010
subtracted state emotion enforcement

331
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,810
because when the IOT cloud and fund

332
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,819
imperious and mobile are interacting

333
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,520
with each other in the eating needed to

334
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,560
sustain equal the state at first so in

335
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,439
the command to the state so how to

336
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,410
unique the state we try to use handle

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,960
shake up particles to to keep the three

338
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:49,170
identity States always you know you go

339
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,840
the combinations for example if we found

340
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,780
out a cloud and mobile opinion still won

341
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,420
a battle so Ltd we're trading in the

342
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,579
state for we will force the LT cloud

343
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,569
they were forced LG device try to

344
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:06,000
compare to still one sin we can continue

345
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,230
in addition because this sensing equals

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,360
estate the LD clause can be aware of

347
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,010
either you two working in the state for

348
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,530
and still keep the connection visual

349
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,710
route device so either contrasted easily

350
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,810
refused other device requires nothing in

351
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,000
these days so to finally we just

352
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,800
conclude our paper they analyzed the

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,080
interaction models from us to the

354
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,839
transaction view and identify some

355
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,150
expertise real transactions and the user

356
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,760
combination of this flow to travel some

357
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,699
new attacks and we also proposed some

358
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,950
defense suggestions and I think this is

359
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,980
in my time and thank you all I'm happy

360
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:48,200
to take any questions

361
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:55,620
[Applause]

362
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:58,110
thanks very much looks like you found

363
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,360
some vulnerabilities have you had any

364
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,010
interaction with vendors about these

365
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,680
vulnerabilities and getting in fixed

366
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,640
yeah we have we have all tell them the

367
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,580
tapana bit here and someone ability is

368
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:18,420
see how fix but but uh still have some

369
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:20,909
measure variability working on Facebook

370
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,920
very nice work I have a question so I

371
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,050
just come here I have more than ten LT

372
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,850
device inside my home so what can I do

373
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:33,060
now to provide these is happening this

374
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,980
is a interesting interesting questions

375
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:41,250
and also we have show some was some

376
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,780
attacks to our device to to to it to

377
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,430
this IOT device but normally it's used

378
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,310
to attacker try to carry out our phenom

379
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,550
device she forced an ear to to carry

380
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:57,360
some device information as a you device

381
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:59,010
strategy used so to that attacker may be

382
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
near to a Buddha fools a booth for

383
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,850
summer

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,570
identity information like in your homes

385
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:09,360
and normally to attack another will not

386
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,120
to be targeting you but if you want to

387
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,240
defenses but you want to define that you

388
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,590
are you probably - I think you probably

389
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:23,580
- need to track or check all your device

390
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,879
all the time - to you officer some you

391
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,710
go today's because for example you just

392
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,600
normally use the device and you check

393
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:35,250
your device and not just connecting and

394
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:38,520
you you meet you you may - immediately -

395
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,320
are to help device manufacturer was it a

396
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,660
native your tracks you will track for

397
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,159
you and in the future I think the smart

398
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,950
home will be better and the most murder

399
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,040
and I can't defend this attack all right

400
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,080
thanks we got time for one more question

401
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,270
hi been on this Feliciano Clara

402
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,399
University so it seems that the main

403
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,920
reason that these attacks happen is

404
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,870
because you can just look into those

405
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,330
apps and basically extract the

406
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,300
certificates right from those mobile

407
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,510
apps or look into the fever you know so

408
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,970
my question is that have you what range

409
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,610
of devices did you look into and for

410
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,950
example did you look into ring devices

411
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,340
nest or philips hue devices were you

412
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,770
able to also extract the certificates of

413
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,580
these kind of devices or you are able to

414
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:28,940
you know just you know perform this kind

415
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,120
of attacks really a small set of devices

416
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,910
okay

417
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,110
first our attack is you know the device

418
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:40,440
of a specific attack or attack is the

419
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,139
platform specific because auto the

420
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,000
different device used also there are

421
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,130
some different device but for the

422
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,500
similar smartphone platform they will

423
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:52,200
use similar interaction models

424
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,240
so our target rather affects all the

425
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,400
other devices in the sim smartphone

426
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,710
platform and and for your suggestions

427
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:06,120
our test platform as just showed before

428
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,070
is the small since use a smart summer

429
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,340
sound system artisans and for the real

430
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,929
either use our future either our future

431
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,510
work and

432
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:19,270
for the sim for the month a smartphone

433
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,270
platform we just test our three kind of

434
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,600
device and for your next questions is

435
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:27,600
you me how how because credit the device

436
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,409
credential from the device

437
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,929
yeah that's right yeah sure keys yeah

438
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,210
first waitress on user device identity

439
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:40,380
information since identity informations

440
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:43,330
as with has the Sun platform is not used

441
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,970
device a credential hug holding in the

442
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,070
analogy device so to ask identity is the

443
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,590
Chandler is a chatter generated from the

444
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,960
cloud you can send a summer like MAC

445
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,970
address as just add some target device

446
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,730
and you can catch the SIM identity

447
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,920
informations and also you for you refer

448
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:04,960
to device I teach as a hawk holding in

449
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:07,780
the device and be a the imagine said you

450
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,090
know run home the attacker may wants to

451
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,280
access his home bus and a freaking gases

452
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:16,030
information and it's a finger Cariad

453
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,190
this attack and anywhere it and you can

454
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,350
check out motive health your paper I

455
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,830
have discussed used a whole section your

456
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,240
paper

457
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,270
alright thank you all right let's give

458
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,279
way another round of thunderous applause

459
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,279
[Applause]
