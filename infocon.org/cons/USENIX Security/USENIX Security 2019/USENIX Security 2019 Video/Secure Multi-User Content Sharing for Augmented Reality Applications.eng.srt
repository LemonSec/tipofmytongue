1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,590
hello everyone my name is Kimberly and

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,360
I'm very happy to be here today to talk

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,490
to you about our work on securing

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,340
multi-user content sharing for augmented

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,169
reality applications so you've probably

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,700
heard of augmented reality or mixed

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,080
reality for the purposes of this talk

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,538
I'll stick with the term augmented

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,189
reality these are technologies that have

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,930
been hitting the news on platforms

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,800
ranging from smartphones to head mounted

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,830
displays to even car windshields with

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,290
coming out from small companies and

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,150
large tech giants like and with

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,430
applications ranging from gamers gaming

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,989
to commerce to enterprise and what all

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,909
of these technologies have in common is

18
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,680
that they continuously process sensory

19
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:53,019
input from the user surroundings and

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,570
overlay digital content on top of the

21
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,890
users perception of the world so

22
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,120
conceptually we can think of this as a

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,820
pipeline in which an air application

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,070
takes some sensory input and uses that

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,210
information to generate digital output

26
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,890
to then give to the user and because of

27
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,259
the power that air applications have

28
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,970
over users perception the security and

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,460
privacy community has done some

30
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,259
important work in trying to apply good

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,298
security and privacy principles to the

32
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,130
scenario some prior work for instance

33
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,859
has looked at the risks of feeding a our

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,500
applications raw sensor input and has

35
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,689
proposed filtering his input before it

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,170
reaches the application other work has

37
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:34,148
looked at the risks of unregulated

38
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,369
output going straight to the user and

39
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:38,289
has proposed applying policies to that

40
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,920
output that may be malformed or

41
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:44,070
misbehaving before it reaches the user

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,409
and this is all very important work and

43
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,570
it's a great first step towards being

44
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:52,240
able to have a more secure and private

45
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,008
kind of reality space but the future of

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,170
augmented reality is likely to look more

47
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,179
like this where multiple users are

48
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,240
working together maybe in the same

49
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:04,719
physical space maybe not to collaborate

50
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,068
on some shared virtual content and the

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,169
solution to modeling this from a

52
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:11,080
security and privacy perspective is not

53
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:13,059
simply to replicate this pipeline this

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,620
doesn't capture the interactions between

55
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,140
the users and the virtual space that

56
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,519
they inhabit so we have to instead look

57
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,869
at these interactions and ask ourselves

58
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,720
what could possibly go wrong

59
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,580
now the answer

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,390
question I'm gonna abstract this diagram

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,380
away a bit so we can see what's going on

62
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,359
suppose that while these three users are

63
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,160
working together a message pops up for

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,800
one of them that's publicly visible but

65
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,720
really should not have been and suppose

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,880
another user comes along and decides to

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,220
draw some virtual graffiti on the model

68
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,630
that everyone is working on or decides

69
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,520
to play a prank on another user by

70
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,700
attaching a sign to them that they were

71
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,740
not expecting or an apology to anyone

72
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,839
who is very afraid of spiders creates a

73
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,360
giant arachnid that everyone can see and

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,500
nobody can get rid of these are all

75
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,940
potential problems and if we're not

76
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,709
careful we're going to build a world in

77
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,270
which they're commonplace in fact we're

78
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,760
already starting to see precursors of

79
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,080
these issues and technologies today

80
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,519
virtual reality which is a step ahead of

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,320
augmented reality and penetrating the

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,440
consumer market has been grappling with

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,750
issues of harassment between players for

84
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,459
years and in smartphone augmented

85
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,240
reality we're starting to see cases of

86
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:22,250
vandalism and other such misdemeanors so

87
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,750
we have an opportunity as a security and

88
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,270
privacy community at this critical time

89
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,070
to work on these problems and work to

90
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,070
mitigate them before they become more

91
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,320
widespread which brings us to our goal

92
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,350
which is to design multi-user AR

93
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,359
security and privacy primitives now this

94
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,799
is a pretty broad goal and in order to

95
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,080
make this more specific and formalize

96
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,330
this we formulated a case a set of case

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,350
studies that sit in several strategic

98
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:51,739
positions in the design space of

99
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,260
possible air applications we've looked

100
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,970
at applications where sharing is an

101
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,679
opt-in procedure versus an opt-out

102
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:04,340
procedure and we looked at those where

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,959
the users are co-located versus ones in

104
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,150
which users are not necessarily in the

105
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,560
same physical space and the three case

106
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,070
studies that are relevant for us here

107
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,470
are people in which multiple users can

108
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,168
shoot virtual paint at each other no

109
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,978
mess multi team whiteboards in which

110
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:24,349
multiple users can work potentially in

111
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:27,110
same or separate spaces alone or

112
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,020
together to write content on virtual

113
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,479
whiteboards and community art in which

114
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,859
users can create freeform virtual

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,849
content and place it around the world

116
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,849
for everyone to see

117
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,270
and from these case studies we were able

118
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:43,430
to build out our threat model in a more

119
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,930
specific and formalized way we look

120
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,349
specifically at multiple users of a

121
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,849
single application who may attempt to

122
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:52,759
share unwanted air content with other

123
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:55,400
users to see private air content

124
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,439
belonging to another user or to perform

125
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,159
unwanted manipulations on air content

126
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,930
belonging to another user so now we have

127
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,699
more specifically we want to design

128
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,009
multi-user air security and privacy

129
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,069
primitives that protect users from each

130
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,020
other but we're not done so we remember

131
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,569
this example and we remember that this

132
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,490
is a good use case of air technology we

133
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:18,319
want to still enable this to happen we

134
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,000
want to enable application developers to

135
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,669
easily build this kind of an application

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,849
without inviting the problems that we

137
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,859
introduced earlier which means we need

138
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,430
to design our to achieve our goal in a

139
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,719
functionality friendly sorta way and to

140
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,819
give you a sense of why this is hard I'd

141
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:38,150
like to contrast the kick me sign from

142
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:39,560
before with a paintball case study both

143
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,318
of these involve attaching virtual

144
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,419
content to users but for the sign it's

145
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,190
bad and we want to prevent it for

146
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,620
paintball it's good and even necessary

147
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,150
for application functionality and the

148
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,979
difference between these critically is

149
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,620
dependent entirely on application

150
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,568
semantics which means that if we're

151
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,819
building a general-purpose solution we

152
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,370
cannot distinguish good versus bad a

153
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,620
priori in this case we have to loop

154
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,060
application developers in and give them

155
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,680
a voice and what makes sense in their

156
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,539
application so what we need to do to

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,729
achieve our goal is to help developers

158
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:17,419
to achieve our goal and to give them the

159
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,068
power to choose the primitives that make

160
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,628
sense for their application without

161
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,370
overwhelming them with options and

162
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,610
without making them reimplemented out of

163
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,439
code so that brings us to the full form

164
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,389
of our goal which is to design

165
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,339
functionality friendly multi-user

166
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,560
AR security and privacy primitives that

167
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:37,430
help developers to protect users from

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,839
each other our approach to achieving

169
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,419
this goal is to build an application

170
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,800
level developer toolkit one benefit of

171
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,870
this approach is that by packaging

172
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,449
controls behind an API we can reduce a

173
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,270
developer burden for the same reasons

174
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:53,150
that inap is is usually a good idea

175
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,039
by not relying on OS support we

176
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,620
facilitate the ease of deployment and

177
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,849
practice we make it easy for us to share

178
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,520
our toolkit with developers through

179
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,599
standard channels and we also open the

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,299
possibility of cross-platform

181
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,400
compatibility that does mean that we

182
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,349
can't protect and misuse or abuse by an

183
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,789
application developer but we consider

184
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,500
this to be a reasonable trade-off in

185
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,930
light of the other benefits and of the

186
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,509
state of the technology and we also note

187
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,780
that operating systems support is

188
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,550
necessary but not sufficient to protect

189
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,440
against malicious app developers at any

190
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:30,050
rate so we leave that to future work in

191
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,210
order to achieve our goal and to in to

192
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,740
build our design we break down our

193
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,020
design components along two major

194
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,960
dimensions first the locus of control

195
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,669
and second the type of control for the

196
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,229
locus of control we have outbound

197
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,479
sharing controls which are those that

198
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,360
pertain to how content belonging to one

199
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,650
user is shared with other users and

200
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,639
inbound sharing controls which pertain

201
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,979
to how a user's reality is augmented by

202
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,110
content coming from other users for type

203
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,120
of control we have what and with whom an

204
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,190
object is shared where an object is

205
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,919
shared and how much information from

206
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,060
that object is shared we have design

207
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,680
points for each of the entries in this

208
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,599
table and the ones that I've highlighted

209
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,060
in blue are the ones where there is the

210
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,219
biggest gap between the precedence of

211
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,810
existing technologies and the

212
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,030
requirements of this new augmented

213
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,130
reality setting what they all have in

214
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,229
common is that they hinge on the tight

215
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,870
integration of virtual content in

216
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,568
augmented reality with users physical 3d

217
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,250
space this is what's new about AR this

218
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,930
is what's driving a lot of the

219
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,570
innovations that we need to make in

220
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,260
order to adapt to this very physical

221
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,520
sort of a setting and for the sake of

222
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,809
time I'm only going to be able to talk

223
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,539
about one of these which is private

224
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,039
content in a shared world and I choose

225
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,149
this one because it highlights the

226
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,890
difficulty of achieving both

227
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,959
functionality and security at the same

228
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,870
time and the considerations that we need

229
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,969
to take into account in order to do so

230
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,130
so what is this problem the problem is

231
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,870
effectively that we are human and we are

232
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,240
accustomed to seeing the same things in

233
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,190
the same places this is natural we

234
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,990
scaffold our behavior around this shared

235
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,770
world understanding for instance we

236
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,260
don't stand for

237
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,329
the TV when someone's watching it but

238
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,510
augmented reality doesn't have that kind

239
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:15,380
of physicality unless the content itself

240
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:18,650
is also shared between users and so what

241
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,480
this means then is that there's a

242
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:23,060
problem when we consider the simple

243
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,180
solution of making private content

244
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,949
private just by making it private let's

245
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,390
take our earlier example of this message

246
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,390
that popped up for only this one

247
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,550
particular user if we decided that only

248
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,810
this user should see this message we

249
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,430
could run into a case in which another

250
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,040
user can walk in front of or through

251
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,780
that message and at the same time not

252
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,339
have any sort of a behavioral cue that

253
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,100
they're doing anything problematic and

254
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,930
this disconnect is severe enough that

255
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,420
one air headset manufacturer has

256
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,829
explicitly told developers that all

257
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,969
content should be made publicly visible

258
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,560
to all users all the time which solves

259
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,120
the issue of a shared world but brings

260
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,699
us right back to where we started in

261
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,860
terms of trying to manage private

262
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,610
content in this world that everyone can

263
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,640
see so the seams on its face to be an

264
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,290
irreconcilable tension but it is not and

265
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,030
in fact in our design we're able to

266
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,089
solve this problem with a technique that

267
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,920
we call ghosting this technique

268
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,810
effectively separates out the sharing of

269
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,640
the location and physicality of an

270
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,229
object from the sharing of other

271
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,080
sensitive information that object may

272
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,940
contain so in this example for instance

273
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,280
the message that only should be shown to

274
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,110
one user may appear in full to just that

275
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,959
user and may appear to other users

276
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,150
simply as a gray box which aivalis

277
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,530
traited here with an icon but in

278
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,770
practice we give developers the

279
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:45,620
flexibility to choose what kind of ghost

280
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,270
object makes sense for them in the based

281
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,860
on what applicate what information that

282
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:55,250
object is conveying and so in doing so

283
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,080
we are able to give all users a shared

284
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,230
cue as to what's going on in their

285
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,390
shared virtual space but we also have

286
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,890
the benefit of protecting the private

287
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:08,330
content only for the user who should see

288
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:09,830
it and so in doing so we're able to both

289
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,580
achieve functionality and security at

290
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:16,790
the same time we built an implementation

291
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,510
of our design that we called share AR is

292
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,089
an application

293
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,470
library written for microsoft hololens

294
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,360
we make some minimal assumptions about

295
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,700
the development environment most notably

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,410
that it's unity based and although we

297
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,680
use microsoft's mixed reality toolkit

298
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,600
sharing its layer to connect between

299
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,849
devices we've made our design modular

300
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,290
enough that developers can easily swap

301
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,330
that out for another inner device

302
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,959
connectivity method or even develop try

303
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,540
another platform we evaluated or design

304
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,190
along several dimensions first we looked

305
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,380
at compatibility with existing design

306
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,000
recommendations and we showed that

307
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,700
developers don't have to choose between

308
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,890
using our toolkit and being able to

309
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,840
adhere to their chosen set of guidelines

310
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:00,199
with regard to multi-user augmented

311
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,670
reality interactions we also constructed

312
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,800
representative case study applications

313
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,969
based on the case studies that I talked

314
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,819
about earlier here are some screenshots

315
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,680
from them and this shows that our design

316
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,270
is flexible enough to support the

317
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,849
functionality needs of a range of

318
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,380
different use cases we also looked at

319
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,390
the security and privacy properties of

320
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,860
these applications to check that we are

321
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,830
able to actually enforce them in

322
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,420
practice and finally we conducted a

323
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,400
performance measurement that show that

324
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,270
the cost of using our toolkit is very

325
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,400
reasonable we're continuing to evaluate

326
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,930
this in practice the summer we have two

327
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,449
undergraduates working to build

328
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,400
applications using share AR to continue

329
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:40,100
to vet the toolkits practicality here

330
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,079
they are the toolkit is also available

331
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,880
for other developers and researchers to

332
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,050
download and play around with and we're

333
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,240
looking for further feedback from

334
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,319
practical use of this toolkit and if

335
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,610
this is something that's interesting to

336
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,500
you we'd love for you to visit err

337
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,460
sharing toolkit comm to try it out for

338
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,260
yourself so in summary multi-user air

339
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,340
security is a topic that needs the

340
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,069
attention of the security and privacy

341
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,960
community but security is not enough in

342
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,940
order to actually build practical

343
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,830
solutions we have to build security

344
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,300
salute and privacy solutions based on

345
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,650
the functionality requirements of the

346
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,560
applications and systems that we're

347
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,420
building for in this work we contribute

348
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,910
a set of goals that a multi-user air

349
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,530
security framework should meet a design

350
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,329
that meets those goals and an

351
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,829
implementation that helps multi-user air

352
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,630
app developers and practice to achieve

353
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,060
functionality and security in their

354
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,710
applications I'd like to thank my

355
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,018
collaborators including my mentors and

356
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,339
the new members of this area our team

357
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,809
security and privacy lab as well as the

358
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,399
project's funders please visit our

359
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:36,730
website and try our code and I'm happy

360
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,730
to take questions

361
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,899

363
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:54,229
with Apple I'm curious how you've

364
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,569
weighed the benefits of obscuring this

365
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,819
content versus just removing it all

366
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,709
together from a shared space because if

367
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:02,569
we're engaged in a discussion like this

368
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,329
I could get a notification on my watch

369
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:08,089
on my device you wouldn't know and we

370
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,279
wouldn't be interrupted but if some sort

371
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,929
of thing pops up in a 3d space everybody

372
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,649
is aware that this user is being

373
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,749
interrupted

374
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,129
they might not pay attention or maybe

375
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:19,850
even the fact that there is private

376
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:21,319
information consent so it's an

377
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,089
interesting question and thank you for

378
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,199
that one thing that I would say is that

379
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,709
when you get a notification on your

380
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,540
phone

381
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,368
people can see there's a phone people

382
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,439
can see that there's a watch with

383
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,939
augmented reality the only thing that

384
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:34,099
you see is that they have some sort of a

385
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:36,529
device that you know that's being used

386
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,720
but if they're trying to manipulate

387
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:39,920
something that is out you know ten feet

388
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,199
in front of them or something like that

389
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,139
all of a sudden that physicality is gone

390
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:48,079
and there's only a limited amount that

391
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,850
we can do you know it's there's lots of

392
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,019
potential future work forth bystanders

393
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,879
for instance who don't have an air

394
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:57,529
device and so what we what we're trying

395
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,860
to tackle specifically is the problem of

396
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:04,999
what when multiple users of the

397
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,920
application we can at least mitigate

398
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:08,869
this this problem from the perspective

399
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,878
of multiple users of the of the air

400
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,869
application so I do think there's future

401
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,069
work but there is something that's

402
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,569
fundamentally different about when the

403
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:16,729
content the arak interacting with is

404
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:22,368
separated from a very clear sort of a

405
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:25,009
screen Elizabeth Mills Microsoft

406
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:27,439
research in Princeton and they send

407
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:29,449
research evidence that AR and VR

408
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,429
developers come from less traditional

409
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:33,559
development backgrounds and I was

410
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,749
curious how you thought about training

411
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,939
developers to use the resources you're

412
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:39,209
creating or how in the future you might

413
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,709
do work on

414
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:43,709
usability of these kind of resources

415
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:46,439
yeah and that's also a great point and

416
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,819
it's important that we don't only make

417
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:49,410
this toolkit available but that we also

418
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,089
make it easy to use and that's something

419
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,368
that we've thought about a lot in the

420
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,660
design of the API and it's something

421
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,300
that future work should definitely

422
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,540
continue to look at in practice for our

423
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,769
part we're doing our best to put forward

424
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,360
documentation that explains in very

425
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:04,790
clear language what exactly is the

426
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,309
problem that we're trying to solve and

427
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,490
why this toolkit is important and we

428
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,679
hope that way by getting the word out

429
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,629
that this is something that means

430
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,420
looking at the developers will be able

431
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:25,069
to pick up these ideas and and run with

432
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:25,069
it great thank you so much Kimberly
