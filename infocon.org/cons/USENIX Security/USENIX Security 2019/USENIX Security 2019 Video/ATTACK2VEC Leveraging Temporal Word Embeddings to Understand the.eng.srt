1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,400
I talked about the our research on

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,080
leveraging the temper over the inviting

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,660
to understand the evolution

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,080
this is a joint work with Gianluca and

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:28,520
this is his Twitter handle it's pretty

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,839
short write it down anyway so for the

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,269
outline of the talk is pretty

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,510
straightforward I will cover four parts

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,230
the motivation the co idea due to time

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,390
restraints

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,730
I will only cover some evaluation routes

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,129
and that will focus on the limitations

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,730
what we didn't do well whatever the

14
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,349
shortage

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,349
I mean business basically the

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:51,110
shortcoming of this method so that would

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:57,260
be transparent and foster some

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:01:00,470
discussions the summary of our research

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,439
that the NGO is priestly forward we try

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:06,890
to understand how the explanation of the

21
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:10,250
vulnerabilities evolve over the time as

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,810
part of the multiple step attack at the

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,140
same time we're hoping to provide

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:18,799
insights into how the attackers operates

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,980
a same time offer human and an assist a

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,790
new perspective when analyzing ideas

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,130
alerts talking about the motivations

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,430
let's start with the example regarding

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,800
the CVE 2018 7602

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,840
it's about the true power remote code

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:42,080
execution suppose we have the ground

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,020
truth we would be able to get the script

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,880
or with the binary from the attackers we

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,950
get every single strategy that we can

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,110
actually see a brown check this use

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,740
properly straightforward to observe that

37
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:58,039
is a recon face scanning branch used

38
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:03,408
attacking different content management

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:06,200
systems and trying to exploit over the

40
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,820
time we get another ground truth we get

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,848
another script from the same attacker

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,650
group we extract another branch you will

43
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:16,040
see that is the same one and rapidity

44
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,000
will be leveraged in a different context

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,099
is more surrounding this tuple ecosystem

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,099
by exploiting the PHP then the security

47
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,388
injection and the last one is special

48
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,730
because a lot of people talking about

49
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:32,189
the micro G in the cold fusion

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:37,170
to Drupal so that's why they're just

51
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:39,900
trying to do this kind of exploit if you

52
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,689
piss everything together and go back to

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,280
the tenement three bola you got it you

54
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,500
will actually see how the same is

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,420
reflected in the tenement tree you can

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,609
understand the operations you'll be able

57
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,059
to tell that how many endpoints being

58
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,780
exploited the challenge is pretty

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,180
straightforward

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,730
we don't have the ground choose and for

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,650
the tenements a level yes if you want to

62
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,328
study how the vulnerability being

63
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,329
exploited that's where you highlight it

64
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:11,310
the rest of things just remain in the

65
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:14,790
Douglas to make sense even worse the

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,590
challenges there are two challenges the

67
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,870
first thing is that we don't have

68
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,870
obvious even relationships when we

69
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:30,659
actually explore looking at the

70
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:33,260
telemetry data and the context all the

71
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:37,440
security vent and its relationship

72
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,228
matrix that at a certain time there may

73
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,019
be two different attack branches will be

74
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:44,849
used together and it is a transition

75
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,970
period maybe the attackers are looking

76
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,939
for how to use this exploit more

77
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,459
effectively more efficiently so there's

78
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,870
a transition period and make you look at

79
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,870
the telemetry you will get confused

80
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:04,339
whatever we can do we can actually look

81
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:07,500
at the tournament you did here's our

82
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,379
observation so the left-hand side is

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,629
attack that is something that we won't

84
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,268
be able to get from the point of view

85
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,000
ground shoes and in the middle you got

86
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,668
an IPS system through protecting the

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,419
customers and towards the right-hand

88
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:29,008
side you have the telemetry data that's

89
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:31,289
what we get from that point on usually

90
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:34,470
we will leave reach the time series

91
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:37,200
based on the frequencies so for example

92
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,560
for the same exploit we can actually

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,640
plot how this exploit being used in the

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,220
wild

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,830
it is useful I have to admit this one is

96
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,130
very useful but it is not easily exploit

97
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,229
in isolated way you will see that the

98
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,860
time series of the frequencies that's

99
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,120
all you get

100
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,370
but how these attacks are used as a part

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,410
of the complex cyber attacks you won't

102
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:08,440
get that from this picture over when we

103
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,030
put multiple time series together for

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,880
example this one you will see actually

105
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,369
four exploits relating to the web

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,190
servers we're putting them together

107
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,100
trying to understand how these exploits

108
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,140
are used in a wild so we have a big

109
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,169
picture how the web servers are

110
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,960
exploited it's pretty difficult to

111
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:32,590
compare the time series especially when

112
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,200
you see the Apache suits exploit is out

113
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,560
there and dominating the rest of the

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,659
time series unless you zoom in even you

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,340
zoom in like in the internet you

116
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,250
probably won't be able to observe much

117
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:50,469
information our co idea is pretty

118
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,070
straightforward we will see the action

119
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,750
from the attackers it is not observable

120
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,590
logging out the stress on this point and

121
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,610
then we have the IPS system and we will

122
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,820
actually see the reflection of attackers

123
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,550
action so that's the very key

124
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,270
observation for us to make some is

125
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:17,080
simple we think that per security event

126
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:19,510
which is it as a word per endpoint

127
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,669
telemetry data which written as a

128
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:27,010
sentence putting them together we have

129
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,719
billions of endpoints and you treat the

130
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,229
attackers they're writing their

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,229
histories in the endpoint you have the

132
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:38,370
documents you have the author's so we

133
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:40,750
can actually leave a reach possibly

134
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,260
natural language processing techniques

135
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,570
to do some processing and understand if

136
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,110
it is possible to leverage these

137
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,390
techniques to understand how these

138
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,130
security events actually evolved over

139
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,669
the time

140
00:06:54,130 --> 00:07:02,920
one thing we have to deal with is the

141
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:06,020
laws that because of the concurrency and

142
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,470
also the system recording the security

143
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,729
events the order may not be preserved

144
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,090
that is something that we need to bear

145
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,820
in mind so we propose a symmetric

146
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,479
context window surrounding the event

147
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,909
that is supposed to investigate to deal

148
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,580
with the a noise incurred by concurrency

149
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:31,210
so that is the context window you center

150
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:35,300
around e 11 you'll be able to capture

151
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:39,340
the security events that may occur at

152
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:44,060
the same time with this security event

153
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:47,450
from there we would be able to get the

154
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,780
co-occurrence tapas or the security

155
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:53,360
events that are surrounding let's say

156
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:59,030
even 11 will peak at all these topples

157
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,150
out move on from the co-occurrence tapas

158
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,450
we leverage the positive point wise

159
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:08,210
mutual information basically these three

160
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:11,240
equations there to generate the ppomi

161
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,650
matrix so we'll be able to generate how

162
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,240
the security events co-occur with others

163
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,820
so we can actually quantify the

164
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:27,200
likelihood two security events co-occur

165
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:29,480
in the context window furthermore we

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,169
will be able to actually do the matrix

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,570
factorization to get a tense

168
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:39,710
representation about the each security

169
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:44,510
events note that this is a t dimensional

170
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,950
vector and it is way smaller than the

171
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,990
number of security events you are

172
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,210
investigating so you have a tenancy

173
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,970
vector so we'll be able to further

174
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,520
reduce the noise and capture the events

175
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,730
with high order occurrence the high

176
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,040
order occurrences meaning the security

177
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,010
events appear in similar context you

178
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,118
don't need to be the exact context just

179
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,529
similar context

180
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:11,859
from the methodology perspective of

181
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:13,839
course it is just one timestamp since

182
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:16,420
we're going to understand how the things

183
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:24,040
evolve we have to deal with the temporal

184
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:27,279
changes so front / x time that this

185
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,349
vector space will actually use this

186
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,109
equation here to consider all the

187
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,540
embeddings across the whole opposite

188
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:37,509
version period and we'll be able to

189
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,019
autumn eyes how the scenes are embedded

190
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:43,149
in the vector space so the one advantage

191
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:46,389
is that since I've already mentioned the

192
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:49,899
vector space we would it transform the

193
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:53,199
Eventide ease into let's say T

194
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,989
dimensional space from there we have

195
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:59,738
fast and good algorithms to evaluate

196
00:09:55,989 --> 00:10:02,649
this vector data so what we can do will

197
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:04,449
be limited by our imagination since the

198
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,919
vectors that's what we'll be able to

199
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:10,540
operate from architectural perspective

200
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,119
I've already talked about the upstream

201
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,079
method basically we convert the raw data

202
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:19,749
into temporary embeddings / security

203
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,388
event and then I will move on to talk

204
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,519
about the downstream analysis tasks

205
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:29,379
there are three of them change detection

206
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:31,149
trend identification and the evolution

207
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,980
evaluation basically how the context

208
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:38,499
change for the point of view data set we

209
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,360
use the anonymized security even data

210
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:43,959
connected from the semantic entry in

211
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,949
prevention system in the data we

212
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:53,109
connected it contains around 80 100

213
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:55,628
unique event IDs from there per day we

214
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,230
get about 190 million security events

215
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:02,079
per day from billions of endpoints we're

216
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:07,480
connected under two days data between

217
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:09,488
2016 and 2018 note that we do this just

218
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,100
for to understand from a long-term

219
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:16,689
perspective how the vulnerabilities

220
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,100
evolve from the protocol perspective you

221
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:18,760
don't need to go through the two years

222
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,190
you can

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,569
just say half a year you will be able to

224
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:29,380
observe a short term evolution so the

225
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,510
first for the change detection we talked

226
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,900
about how we can identify the changes

227
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,990
per security even change so this one is

228
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,959
a PHP myadmin RFI CBE

229
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,150
you'll be to say that before the CPU was

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,540
disclosed the embedding is pretty stable

231
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,610
that means our method is working because

232
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:53,500
the context doesn't exist

233
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:59,860
they're supposed to be stable after that

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:00,490
you can see that our similarity actually

235
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,720
changed

236
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:07,000
you will see a swift diversion from the

237
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,220
long existing context means therapy some

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,740
contacts there so that's the difference

239
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,290
that's where you see where the drift

240
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:19,930
happens at the same time there is a gap

241
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:23,530
between where the contacts starting

242
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,109
drafting to the disclosure date this one

243
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,890
has already been documented by a paper

244
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,650
in NDS 2015 so we will also be able to

245
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:41,590
capture that kind of small difference

246
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:44,079
here the second and it analysis task is

247
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,360
trend identification so to the left hand

248
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,150
side that's the frequency pi is the time

249
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,300
series analysis you will see a spike I'm

250
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:56,079
probably not the second spike over the

251
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:59,199
time and atactic vector will be able to

252
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,350
leverage the vector norms to identify

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,160
the securities even usage in a more

254
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:09,130
meaningful way you will see the spike

255
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,439
from here up there you will be it's

256
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,439
actually correct corresponding to the

257
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,630
spike here and the usage will be

258
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,150
reasonably stabilized because our

259
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:23,050
purchases has been a very popular attack

260
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,850
vector comparing to the time series this

261
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,790
one is more stable and show you the

262
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:31,840
trend how it is used to this stable

263
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,730
strenght ignoring all the velocity from

264
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,860
the

265
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:40,500
frequency side another example is

266
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,390
regarding when you're trying to compare

267
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,490
different security events how they

268
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,620
actually been chained I mean how they

269
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,310
actually used in different trend even

270
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,020
they are actually different magnitude to

271
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,479
to the left hand side you will see that

272
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,260
the internet that's where you can

273
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,260
actually zoom in you still see the spike

274
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:05,020
you cannot tell whether or not the green

275
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,510
line is still used or not so to the

276
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:12,850
right hand side that activator will be

277
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:15,310
to enhance based upon the usage and show

278
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,230
you more meaningful change so security

279
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:22,569
analysis can see that the Green Line is

280
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:27,280
still being used okay so for the last

281
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,930
one is about the event evolution so that

282
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,670
back to the very beginning of this

283
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,640
example when you see actually two

284
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:37,300
campaigns like for example for the first

285
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,760
campaign is a recon recon attack right

286
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,219
and gradually migrated over the time it

287
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,200
is more talking to the tuple itself so

288
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,600
that's supposed to branches suppose we

289
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,210
have them so in the middle you will see

290
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,750
the figure that we capture such kind of

291
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:55,150
drift from the beginning to the end so

292
00:14:52,750 --> 00:15:00,580
basically the blue lines at the top

293
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:05,980
three associated attack vectors we stupa

294
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:07,990
and red lines are the top three attack

295
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,110
vectors associated with Drupal towards

296
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,550
the end of the observation period so

297
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,910
from there we can actually see a clear

298
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:20,349
trend that crotchety the attackers they

299
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:24,250
just migrated is the tuple RC ii c ve

300
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:26,230
from a part of the recon phase into a

301
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,440
more targeted attack because you can see

302
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,190
the similarities the red line is keep on

303
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,670
growing up and the blue line is clearly

304
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,680
dropping over the time okay

305
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,479
i would spend a couple minutes on the

306
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,390
limitations what we didn't do well

307
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,959
regarding its method just for

308
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,949
transparency

309
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,290
so for this one you will see that the

310
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,349
frequency based timer series and all

311
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,569
these attack vectors from the point of

312
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,829
view of elementary it drops almost to

313
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:06,769
zero what was reflected in the octet

314
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:10,790
vector is a job of the trend the trend

315
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:13,999
values the vector loan itself it is not

316
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,429
ideal so that's the part that is not

317
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:19,399
ideal for this method to be sensitive to

318
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:22,939
such change however the good part is

319
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:25,509
that the the trend is not dropping to

320
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:29,660
zero comparing to the frequency part and

321
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:32,209
it will recover quite quickly once we

322
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,910
get the telemetry data back so that's

323
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:39,498
the the part that we didn't do well so

324
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:41,600
it is a sensitive to a case when the

325
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,819
telemetry I mean basically the security

326
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,559
even dropped to almost zero so that's

327
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:52,128
part we didn't do well the second part

328
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,889
of the imitation is that our method is

329
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:59,029
data-driven so it cannot deduce and

330
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:01,579
insights before not even was detected so

331
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:04,130
you can only tell you how these threats

332
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,569
actually changed once you know the

333
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,159
security even do you know the signature

334
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:11,168
then you will be able to see how it is

335
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:14,419
change it and the last part is for our

336
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:16,630
evaluation method its self referential

337
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,029
so basically if you look at all the

338
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:24,350
analysis tasks based on the assumption

339
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:26,179
that this method is correct so that's

340
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:29,629
something that we didn't do well however

341
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:32,390
the one of the things that we can do to

342
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,270
quantify if this method is correct or

343
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,980
not will be based on the assumption we

344
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,639
get at the ground truth so for example

345
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,860
if you get the attack let's say the

346
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,289
script from attackers and you will be

347
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,600
able to extract the multiple attacks

348
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:50,658
then you can go back to the telemetry

349
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,500
level hold out the attack part of the

350
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:56,600
tag as grant choose and predict if I

351
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,870
given this security event when I'm

352
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,530
looking for I'm able to predict

353
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:05,439
the context based upon the ground shoes

354
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,930
we extracted from this script so that's

355
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
one of the things we can do but we

356
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,350
didn't do that in the paper so to this

357
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:22,120
point I will conclude my talk and open

358
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:27,459
the floor for questions all right

359
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,750
any questions hi lovely I have a

360
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,970
question I'm very interested in this

361
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,250
sort of co-occurrence of events and you

362
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,390
had a very nice story on slide earth in

363
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:40,960
39 I just was wondering how common

364
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,900
stories that make sense in exploitation

365
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,580
events that happened in the same window

366
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:50,590
how frequent it is they make sense

367
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:54,179
that's a good question mean to quantify

368
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:57,010
if the observation makes sense or not

369
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:00,130
will be depending on if you have the

370
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,230
ground shoes especially if you don't

371
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,930
have the ground shoes then what you can

372
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,600
do is to induce from the data I have to

373
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:11,500
stress that this method is purely

374
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,139
data-driven so we can actually see if a

375
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,840
given security event kind I mean the

376
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,810
context surrounding it drift or not over

377
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,040
the time so from that point we we will

378
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:26,080
be able to see if the context based on

379
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,649
the context window size you will be able

380
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,820
to see that context really change or not

381
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:35,560
right but I mean as I said I mean unless

382
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,800
you have the ground choose to verify

383
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:44,889
this observation it stays as a data

384
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:47,409
driven perspective yeah I mean yes but I

385
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,000
mean on that you had a very nice story

386
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,400
right I'll show the attacker arrives

387
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,680
with like reconnaissance and then it has

388
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,810
a privilege escalation on that run some

389
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,180
code and then quits something like that

390
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,310
and this was a story that was clearly

391
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,410
showing that attacker had a purpose and

392
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,780
was sort of doing something meaningful

393
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,110
to reach a target that without that

394
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,690
story wouldn't get there but do you also

395
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,429
have evidence of like attacks that don't

396
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,680
make any sense all together

397
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,860
as in it's always the same kind of

398
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,590
attack so I launched all the remote code

399
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,330
execution exploits that I have because

400
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,070
they are all embedded in my exploit kit

401
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,780
and then in just a stupid attack and

402
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,480
throws all the time

403
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,639
twelve attacks that are identical and it

404
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,790
just the attacker being sloppy that's

405
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,090
what I meant by story to make sense it

406
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,250
is possible I mean if you look at the

407
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,689
the security attacks will be done by

408
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,610
amateurs they'll be done by

409
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,490
professionals I'm not sure assuming

410
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,860
actually just let's take the explore it

411
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,470
and just wrong a script it always stays

412
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,090
like that alright can we chat after

413
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,090
maybe yeah I mean we can actually have

414
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,550
it after that sounds good let's thank

415
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:02,300
you in one last time

416
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:02,300
[Applause]
