1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,780
so um as mentioned my name is Haroon and

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,759
i was speaking about how we trace

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,549
transactions that went across cryptic

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,369
cartilages this work is done by myself

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,669
George Capas and Sarah Mahajan all of

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,779
our from University College on so as

7
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,490
obviously we speak about printer

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,390
currencies we shall first start with

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,150
Bitcoin

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,770
so Bitcoin was at many as they said many

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,400
times before the first winter coffee

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,450
that was created in 2009 12 2008 she

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,870
then first you did 2009 waited by one of

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,420
the synonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,410
now with the system he was designed with

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,210
the issue of having pseudonymity without

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,870
by users who transact with each other

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,810
have addresses which are unique and with

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,970
that add a layer of anonymity but within

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,519
this year they also mentioned that there

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,200
are some issues with the system first

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,900
being that's only anonymous if you keep

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,659
your your coin your addresses private

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,780
and the second is that if you leak your

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,030
key then the transactions I have leaked

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,799
can be perhaps been linked towards you

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,840
and for them going backwards and going

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,859
forwards but what they also don't

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,509
mention is that if you were to other

30
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,640
people were to leak your information

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,789
would leak their information that could

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,109
then also be used to target you so

33
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,689
they're not more than five years later

34
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,490
we see a large plethora of research

35
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,699
which looks at attacking back when I

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,048
mean of MTI provides many of these of

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,630
these systems use techniques like

38
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,119
address tracking address tagging and

39
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,189
also address clustering in order to

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,319
identify the antecedent system how they

41
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,770
interact with each other and the overall

42
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,170
flow as well as this we've also seen

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,969
many crimes that no Bitcoin which then

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,380
used these techniques in order to

45
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,908
determine where the coins when and how

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,770
and if they can't float the crimean

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,759
process or the one of the most famous

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,380
ones was the amount GOx hack which the

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,030
very was the biggest exchange back in

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,008
the day for tea they were hired to lost

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,480
many of their coins but but using these

52
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,739
tracking techniques will be able to find

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,010
that these coins actually went to

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,510
another exchange

55
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,879
very recently another exchange balance

56
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,679
was hacked and they they eight million

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,380
dollars worth of bitcoins was stolen

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,200
these are however been

59
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,280
very closely monitors in case say what

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
to move to an exchange with it could be

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,210
prison Bitcoin isn't the only kind of

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,280
currency as you honor there are many

63
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,320
others in the space um there are some

64
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,680
privacy once was almost the cash and

65
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,019
Monaro a Volusia use next and the

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,300
privacy audiology symposium they were

67
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,300
attacked sour the that were shown upon

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,860
these to anonymity wait so I'm trying to

69
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,700
say here that the attacks are not only

70
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,000
supposed to pick one they're also

71
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,100
specific to anonymity coins now all of

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,440
these systems alone these attacks occur

73
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,070
on unchanged that occur within the same

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,450
ecosystem

75
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,160
well the Bitcoin attacks occur in a

76
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,250
Bitcoin or the Zika attacks occur within

77
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,470
Z cash so that's one change seems to be

78
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,960
very studied and very looked into your

79
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,320
amigo system but we've also seen a trend

80
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,290
of crime going across chain this is

81
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,720
where users move their coins from Bix a

82
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,489
Bitcoin and they're backed by a theory

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,990
when the most famous ones ones happen

84
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,760
recently was the one a crack attack

85
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,280
which was a ransom which affected many

86
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,079
hospitals and a do so they were able to

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,820
get one hundred forty two thousand

88
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,590
dollars worth of Bitcoin which they then

89
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,840
laundered through cross currency

90
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,840
exchanges so the question now is can we

91
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,880
track exchanges that allow you to do

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,500
cross currency trades so there are a

93
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,910
couple of exchanges which do this two of

94
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,530
which we will speak about shape-shift

95
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,329
and change Li focusing mainly on

96
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,340
shape-shift what the doggies are

97
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,140
exchange try to do cross currently

98
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,480
trades so they're like a lightweight

99
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,829
exchange they allow user to exchange

100
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,540
multiple coins you're gonna shake bacon

101
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,940
for a 30 mm for bicker whatever point

102
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,780
you have and well the coins support you

103
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,640
can crush it over in currently custom we

104
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,590
have arrived 2000 cryptocurrencies but

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,269
they combine the right to convert over

106
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,500
140 so why would you do cross trade war

107
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,720
there's many reasons that I said before

108
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,430
it's very easy to use which I'll

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,810
demonstrate perhaps give us some

110
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,120
protection and Amity which won't explain

111
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,019
they're not custodial and that means

112
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,610
that you don't need them like you

113
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,020
already need to have your coins in or

114
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,650
account you just go to the website do

115
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,640
the trade

116
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,799
you've got your pointer back are

117
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,969
straight away and also simply cheaper

118
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,390
because you also do a single rate of

119
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,979
change so how do you do a shift with is

120
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,990
very very straightforward you go to a

121
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,938
website and you say yeah I got Bitcoin

122
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,129
and I want to get some thorough

123
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:43,139
the next thing you do is you then say

124
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,520
okay I've got this is the ones I want to

125
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,169
confirm you give them the address that

126
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,128
you want your coins to be sent to it's

127
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,419
not a case we want to give them an

128
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:53,069
ethereal address because we want to get

129
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:55,198
thrown from our trade after that we then

130
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:57,180
send them a bit quick to adjust that

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,039
they specify once they confirm their

132
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,199
bitcoins and they validate transaction

133
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,789
they then will give us an alluring and

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,629
that's it the trade is completely done

135
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,949
you're not gonna cross a cross chain so

136
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,449
what this looks like here on the tube

137
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,770
block changes we've got a queen a which

138
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,120
you're not kiss was Bitcoin and calling

139
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,049
B which you can say is the transaction

140
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,360
flows of ethereum now in point a we said

141
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,500
that we've gone from our case to perhaps

142
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,870
of shifting service that we might know

143
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,759
the address of but in coin B we don't

144
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,680
know where that changes and with that

145
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,490
trades and a dot which no did a go -

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,050
hardly propagate afterwards so the aim

147
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,969
of our research is to indeed find the

148
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,560
link which can allow you to connect the

149
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:39,180
currency which go across chain these are

150
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,279
some of the contributions that we did in

151
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,000
our paper now go through most of them as

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:48,150
we progress through this talk the first

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,310
one being the analysis that we did and

154
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,560
how we obtain the data set in order to

155
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,180
perform our attacks of course to do to

156
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,069
do this attack you first need data and

157
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,500
there was a sensor one much it available

158
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,389
we're gonna get ourselves do this so for

159
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,729
this we just went to the urology see at

160
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,069
the bottom and we scraped they can't the

161
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:10,529
API for a number of month for 30 months

162
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:13,050
no to obtain a large mass of

163
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:15,569
transactions well this will give you is

164
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,699
the following you've got a very simple

165
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,129
JSON which contains full acidic piece of

166
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,199
information the currency inputs are the

167
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,000
personal carts you want to send the

168
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,870
output point to the person the currency

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,610
that they wanted

170
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,189
you've got the amount that had sent and

171
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,289
you've also got the timestamp with these

172
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,389
simple things we cannot figure out what

173
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,710
was the transaction the person did on

174
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:36,810
the first chain so in our case just with

175
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,789
Bitcoin so we know we've got Bitcoin

176
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,710
which is fine here we know we've got a

177
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,080
value of zero point five one and lots of

178
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,279
other digits so we go and chain can we

179
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,550
find a transaction with this specific

180
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,830
output value and this specific time give

181
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,460
or take some blocks was on Bitcoin and

182
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,990
in fact we

183
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,169
did fine and this is an example

184
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,520
transaction that editor now we have this

185
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,039
transaction what do we get we got the

186
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,109
user who did the exchange we also have

187
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,080
the exchange shape-shift which was

188
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,810
platform the use used now funny of this

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,430
the shape-shift exchange actually allow

190
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,780
actual give you information about the

191
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,759
exchange done if you give them an

192
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,059
address let's say this address able to

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,289
use a seconds to you they will then tell

194
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,000
you if this is correct and if it was

195
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,789
quite that will return the full

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,560
transaction that happened so here we see

197
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,110
the user got Bitcoin cash here 2.7

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,810
Bitcoin caches and the transaction hash

199
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,220
that was available I'm just going to

200
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,590
blockchain check this if this is real if

201
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,020
this is real we now have the full data

202
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:37,500
of the exchange and the user and when

203
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,120
they receive the money that's just a

204
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,699
very simple three-step process Script

205
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,470
API find the transaction and then look

206
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,180
at the look again Ali p8 confirm this is

207
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,280
correct although there are ways to do

208
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,759
this without using the API but you can

209
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,419
read that in the paper so now we just

210
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,669
shown you is how to link currencies and

211
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,139
exchanges that go across chain I mean I

212
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,430
found the link and we found the shift

213
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,080
that's to call it so now we know how to

214
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,210
do how to do this attack

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,280
we looked into some of the heuristics

216
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,409
that we could understand to figure out

217
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,059
how users interact

218
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,740
of course we first offer some results we

219
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,500
scripted for 13 months so this as I said

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,509
you've got two point eight million

221
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,669
shifts in total and from need to pick

222
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,449
top eight coins which are around 2.3

223
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,240
million transact

224
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:26,520
transactions to do this we also have to

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,139
go into that run a full node download

226
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,280
all the data and then pass all the data

227
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,180
in order to be able to look into the

228
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,978
chains ourselves so how do we do so

229
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,478
before we were able to try 1.3 million

230
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,909
transactions that weren't completely

231
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,469
cross chain but give us the input

232
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,809
transaction and the upper transaction

233
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,250
duck and so the best case for Z cash we

234
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,529
obtained run 90% of who those

235
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:51,420
transactions for the worst case which is

236
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:53,579
Bitcoin we obtain 76% so we now we know

237
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,959
how to go through the chain what about

238
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,310
what bars people try to be clever why

239
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,560
they try to you know move their coins

240
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,290
around try to be small try to obscure

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,089
what they're doing so that we came up

242
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,199
with two extra heuristics the first one

243
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,910
was called a u-turn now

244
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,370
it's very straightforward as you see in

245
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,680
the picture the two shifts which are

246
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,120
very close in time and proximity the

247
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,250
first case said the person fix something

248
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,920
he can't they have Bitcoin they do one

249
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,510
trade and they go to Z cash after some

250
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,060
time they wait maybe like half an hour

251
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,459
etc then then do another shift and they

252
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,989
go back into Bitcoin question is how

253
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,229
many users did this kind of transaction

254
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,990
and of these can we figure out the

255
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,579
values all if they had perhaps you the

256
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,399
same coins I've gone using different

257
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,510
addresses and then what this allows us

258
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,040
to do is figure out the movement of

259
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,240
coins wants to use a cell money to the

260
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,339
exchange what did they do then after

261
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,380
that so we found over one hundred and

262
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,709
seven thousand transactions which

263
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,089
matched our heuristic of these we found

264
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,189
ten thousand with a person whose exact

265
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,829
same address that they had received quiz

266
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,750
from I was so and of these these a

267
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:56,489
thousand of them actually the exact same

268
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:02,940
coins meaning they did a complete trade

269
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:05,190
going full circle so another case is

270
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,720
round trip what if a use used it went

271
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,690
through the circle but in fact he did

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,980
something in the bottom here between the

273
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,370
trade was kind of obscured what he was

274
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,529
up to you so that is bracing to the

275
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,079
u-turn is two shifts both in close time

276
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,360
and in close value well we're looking

277
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,370
how here is if the first if the value of

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,930
the first shift is similar to the value

279
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,660
of the second shift or if they return to

280
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,399
the exact same input address did this

281
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,630
user go from Bitcoin to Z cash do

282
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,000
something that we weren't sure of and

283
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,910
then go all the way back through back to

284
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,680
the original dress and the advantage

285
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,069
over the original one here is that the

286
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,029
identity of the person of the original

287
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,140
initiator is actually known because you

288
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,970
know this person did a Bitcoin

289
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,560
transaction here and he did something

290
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,430
and then he went through Z cash back

291
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,859
again to his version address now from

292
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,880
from that we find around a hot 10,000

293
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,339
100,000

294
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,740
transactions which which one where is

295
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,850
your stake and of those 10,000 actually

296
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,069
went full circle and use the same

297
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,470
address so this another reason is the

298
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:09,449
point is because it helps us to identify

299
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,459
users who perhaps used the cross chain

300
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,529
system as a way to mix their coins

301
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,010
around and attempt to obscure the

302
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,010
transaction

303
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,829
so now you know how work you know some

304
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,899
of the attacks that we did also look

305
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:25,569
into some real world scams or a real

306
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,920
world scam where someone in fact did use

307
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,959
this question you know to get away with

308
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,939
the crime so um Russia in lost year late

309
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,189
in early January the fan came up caught

310
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,890
starscape capital what they promise is

311
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,750
that if you invest in our fund who in

312
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,220
fact give you a guaranteed 50% return

313
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,829
and our special trading boat which does

314
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,470
lots of magic machine learning and

315
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,910
generates a big income blow up or okay

316
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,440
obviously this is a good deal they look

317
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,180
like legit company let's give them money

318
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,860
and so they did and they raised their on

319
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,219
two point two million dollars in Gerry

320
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,810
2018 then of course you know you can't

321
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,120
even get 50 percent of stock market so

322
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,010
this is of course a scam and soon off

323
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,880
the disappeared the removed got rid of

324
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,370
the coins and moved it to a different

325
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,779
address they moved the website the

326
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,110
Ramudu social media they had completely

327
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,459
gone off the grid but by looking to a

328
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,630
more into more detail using the

329
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:15,670
techniques we showed before we

330
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,990
identified that they actually a quarter

331
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,930
of their theory and they shifted

332
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,779
straight into manera because from that

333
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:29,439
they it can email it to my burner

334
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:30,579
addresses that received these coins so

335
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,050
there are more scammed in the people

336
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,029
which you can look into such as many

337
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,189
scams on ethereum DB which actually go

338
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,890
question but I will leave that out for

339
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,079
the talk when the last time things we

340
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,640
looked into is how it uses make use of

341
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,349
privacy coins you do they use proper

342
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,620
sequence you know to augment the fact

343
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,269
that they can do a crushing so for this

344
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,740
we use two currencies which we know very

345
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,350
well with the first ones that see cash

346
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,699
and the second one was - so Z cash you

347
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,140
have this feature called the shielded

348
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,969
pool and where does it you put your

349
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,769
coins into the pool and then it become

350
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,630
completely hidden or on the chain you

351
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,850
can move senator on the user you can

352
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,620
split your Queen and do everyone but

353
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,459
they will be the addresses and the

354
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,579
values that you thought would be

355
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:11,589
completely hidden so okay for in Z cash

356
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:14,040
how many people send money from the pool

357
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,600
directed to this crushed in exchange

358
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,360
this would mean the exchange refused

359
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,440
coins from a place it cannot

360
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,470
legitimately identify this an unknown

361
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,020
area from that we found our 3800 turns

362
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,399
action which is quite significant which

363
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,540
Kim which are today's money is there are

364
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,390
three quarters of a million dollars

365
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,339
worth of coins

366
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,960
another case we looked into was - sure -

367
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,000
and I shouldn't do something called Co

368
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,860
enjoyed when you makes your transaction

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,330
with many other people and doing so you

370
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,990
try to hide who you are sending your

371
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,070
Queens to fourth man - all the inputs

372
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,270
that you do are similar to the same -

373
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,370
the outputs it makes it very very

374
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:52,300
difficult to determine who had sent

375
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,950
coins to whom that we thought okay how

376
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,390
many people do a quaint join and of

377
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,390
those how many then send them money to

378
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,250
shape-shift from this we found our two

379
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,830
thousand transactions of those one point

380
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,340
of the value is currently 1.2 million

381
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,680
dollars worth this may seem seem like to

382
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,320
be significant Oh - of the volume of

383
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,520
both of these coins over this issue

384
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,810
doesn't agree we don't find that this

385
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,199
kind of music doesn't provide anonymity

386
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,670
it specifically in these two points we

387
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
have to go back and use our u-turn here

388
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,069
so you figure out how people in these

389
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,310
ecosystems

390
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,830
use their addresses on the coins

391
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,180
fortunately people in - it seems to use

392
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,680
the same address quite or not and in

393
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,699
fact with an R you tell you find it was

394
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,620
a 64% of them if I use the same address

395
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,590
and easy cash we found that those who

396
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,930
had done a u-turn 54% of them use the

397
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,520
same address and of this 28% of them

398
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,560
actually use exact same coin you mean

399
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,180
the dinner obviously obviously obtain

400
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,040
any anonymity from using these two

401
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,209
systems the reason for that are clear

402
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,430
paps they don't know to use the system

403
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,630
or perhaps they just weren't sure what

404
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,979
what was happening

405
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,910
perhaps today I want an M and an empty

406
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,650
in the first place the summary these

407
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,959
were our contributions we looked into

408
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,120
transaction of cross chain some of our

409
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,290
heuristics there's a relationship

410
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,030
heuristic which you can look into in a

411
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,740
paper which shows you how entities

412
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,680
within the cross unique system operate

413
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,060
and who are the big plays they're looked

414
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,310
into some real-world scams are also more

415
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,589
in the paper we also looked into how

416
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,260
people trade within the system and if

417
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,430
any of them you for transactions protect

418
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,560
your obtain money i'm chris from

419
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,859
arbitrage all other ways to obtain

420
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,420
profit I will also show some demos and

421
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,520
how people who use privacy queens

422
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,680
interact with a cross chain system for

423
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:43,639
that I am nothing thanks

424
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:47,628
[Applause]

425
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,629
as you have questions we go for lunch

426
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:51,629
hey Dave great talk

427
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:54,749
artemiy from the University of British

428
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,279
Columbia I have a question for example

429
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:58,199
if you have you consider or have you

430
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,629
seen transactions where they possibly

431
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,789
change let's say Theory m2 Bitcoin and

432
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:05,879
Dan used tumbling services or other

433
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,959
privacy-preserving techniques so we we

434
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,049
didn't actually look into whether or not

435
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,399
they use mixing surface often but I mean

436
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,959
we have data so there's no reason why

437
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,249
people couldn't have this there's no

438
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,179
reason that prevents this from happening

439
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:19,979
I did a shirt people did use obtain

440
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,179
Quinn from like for example using Susie

441
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,470
from Zeke I should then from them they

442
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,749
didn't move their money into the pool

443
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,549
this is in the paper people did obtain

444
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,109
went from shape-shift and then do a coat

445
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:29,848
went straight after but I we found will

446
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:31,939
be significantly lower all right thanks

447
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:31,939
so much

448
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:44,740
okay any other questions for her own

449
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:47,139
yeah one thing I didn't quite understand

450
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,699
is with Z cache as I understand the

451
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:53,260
addresses and values are concealed how

452
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:54,579
did you know the total amount and volume

453
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,279
that was being transferred into these

454
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,630
services so Z cache in fact multiple

455
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,339
types of transactions you can do within

456
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,689
the pool one of them is a very private

457
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,610
one which you can't reduce doesn't or

458
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,250
anything which exchange does not allow

459
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,589
you to do but it doesn't like to do an

460
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,169
extra additional transaction where you

461
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,549
go from the pool into the exchange when

462
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:14,740
you do this you do not reveal who you

463
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,599
are but you do reveal how many coins you

464
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,189
send and then from W able to type and

465
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,659
tally the total amounts thank you yeah

466
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:25,929
okay so you have a brief question that

467
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:30,520
you're the way you find transactions

468
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:32,919
realize and timing and on values so what

469
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,168
would be a good attack against your

470
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,110
approach if the attackers willing to get

471
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:40,600
smarter could could they split this over

472
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,840
multiple smaller transactions or wait

473
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,000
you know longer time in order to do the

474
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,500
transfers so there are few ways you can

475
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,850
through when we've done one of them is

476
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,280
students not review the transactions

477
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,110
like the the exchange is very very

478
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,178
transparent just one of the big

479
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,040
advantages if they didn't do this and be

480
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,750
very difficult to track setting up the

481
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,639
second way would be to just look into

482
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,980
how the blockchain operates I try to

483
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,210
mimic other users like this a lot of

484
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,160
people like for example a Bitcoin we

485
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,809
when we found out that there are much

486
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,130
lower accuracy in determining the

487
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,110
transaction but this is because beacon

488
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,880
at such a high throughput that's a lot

489
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,559
people do those values it's hard to

490
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
figure out who was who so they were to

491
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,970
try make that they could obtain more

492
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,440
privacy but the issue then last one was

493
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,090
a very advanced users will they have

494
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,929
time to be able to look into this and is
