1
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,730
thank you hi everyone my name is vector

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,710
from UC San Diego today I gonna talk

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,480
about our work reading the tea leaves a

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,029
comparative analysis of threat

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,649
intelligence this is a joint work from

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,599
multiple institutions so what is threat

7
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,239
intelligence it is a knowledge that

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,760
allows organization to understand and

9
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,360
mitigate cyber attacks and this

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,498
knowledge involves a broad set of things

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,350
it can be malware or run ability report

12
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:47,820
it can be some IP or DNS blacklist where

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,210
we can to actually use them to block

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,670
traffic or it can be some on-the-ground

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,789
forum thread where we can see what the

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,339
bad guys are discussing all those

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,719
knowledge can help secure experts to

18
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:06,390
better understand the threat and

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,760
therefore defend against it among this

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,640
broad set of threat intelligence formats

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,969
one of the most common formats is what

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,860
we call indicator of compromise these

23
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,839
are the forensic data that identify

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,450
malicious activities in a system or

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,229
network and these are the data that are

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,750
directly actionable they can be IP

27
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,740
addresses of malicious actors or

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,070
compromised hosts file hashes that

29
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:38,850
identify malicious malware or domain

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,969
names or URLs of malware command control

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,859
server of some fish sites and we can

32
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,710
directly use this data to let's say

33
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:51,869
block malicious traffic or identify

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,570
malicious files on our system and this

35
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,390
data is surely delivering a form of a

36
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,279
data feed where the consumers subscribe

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,789
to a feed and the threat intelligence

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,119
provided regularly update the feed and

39
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:08,009
some of the commercial threat

40
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,240
intelligence provider will charge fees

41
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:15,750
for providing such service and this is a

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,490
thriving industry the global market the

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,200
global threat intelligence market size

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,390
was estimated about three billion

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,549
dollars in 2016

46
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,940
and this number will go beyond 13

47
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,320
billion

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,270
in 2025 based on market prediction here

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,190
I give some example of the commercial

50
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:37,290
strategies providers but beyond the

51
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,030
commercial scientist provider there are

52
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,310
also many many public data sources

53
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,330
managed by individuals or organizations

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,340
which we can access the data for free

55
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,800
now with so many data sources floating

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,390
around assume we are personally in

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,140
charge of protecting our company's

58
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:01,529
network there's an immediate question

59
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:04,290
which product should we choose we need

60
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,610
an objective way to evaluate the quality

61
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,760
of threat intelligence products

62
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,670
so we can do reasonable comparison more

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,160
specifically we need a set of metrics

64
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:17,910
for free comparison and the techniques

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,680
for calculating this metrics however

66
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,470
there isn't such a standard in the

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,070
community and this is what our work try

68
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,320
to address we define six basic threat

69
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,930
intelligence metrics for feed evaluation

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,200
and we demonstrate the techniques to

71
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,940
calculate this matrix and we folder

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,209
collect a broad set of three internal

73
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,550
data and analyze 47 IP feeds and eight

74
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,620
malware hash feeds yielding these

75
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,060
metrics and we try to answer the

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,100
question can we make a reasonable

77
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,050
decision about which product should we

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,910
choose our data collection include both

79
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,610
commercials by intelligence data and

80
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,180
public threat intelligence data our

81
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,250
commercial data comes from three source

82
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,650
Facebook's right exchange a paid IP

83
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,620
reputation service and a paid feed

84
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,550
aggregator here we anonymize the last

85
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:15,030
two due to our agreement with provider

86
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:19,859
and our data collection period starts

87
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:23,400
from December 1st 2017 to July 20 s was

88
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:27,510
an 18 and we collect all our data hourly

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,909
and for the IP data we further

90
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,979
categorize the data into different

91
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,130
category based on information provided

92
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,719
by a fee themself and conduct analysis

93
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,280
within each category

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,160
here we need to do this characterization

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,559
because different IP have different

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,540
meanings if we just clack a bunch of

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,300
feeds and start comparing each other we

98
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,950
might end up comparing apple orange so

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,360
we want to do a fair comparison and

100
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,780
that's why we have this characterization

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:05:04,660
stage and for the following experiment

102
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:07,869
we Forks on the six most popular we

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,690
focus on the six most popular category

104
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,560
in our data set

105
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,230
they are scanners prefers IPS that have

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,260
come down offers logging attempts

107
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:23,530
malware IPS that serve as malware

108
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,289
command control server ball net hosts be

109
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,940
known to opponent exploit the host I

110
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,510
have conduct remote or an ability

111
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:36,370
exploit and spam IPS that involve in

112
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:40,090
sending spam emails and now we present

113
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,760
our six metrics they are volume which

114
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,320
measure the size of a fee differential

115
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,969
contribution which measures the

116
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,450
additional data when if we can provide

117
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,730
over another feed exclusive contribution

118
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:55,289
which measures the exclusive data one

119
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:58,270
fee can provide among group of feeds

120
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:01,240
latency measured how fast a feed can

121
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,630
report threat and accuracy measure the

122
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,910
false positive rate of each feed and

123
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:12,420
finally coverage marathon well a feed

124
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:15,490
covers the intended threat so among this

125
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,920
six matrix the first three are

126
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,480
quantitative metrics it doesn't involve

127
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,200
the meaning of the indicators so they

128
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,890
are easy to calculate but the last three

129
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,159
are qualitative metrics and because it's

130
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,590
very hard for us to get the ground truth

131
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,390
of the underlying threat it is very

132
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,099
difficult to comprehensively evaluate

133
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:41,200
this qualitative metrics so we need some

134
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,660
external data to help us estimate these

135
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,219
metrics and in the falling of this talk

136
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,750
we're going to demonstrate some of these

137
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,520
techniques and more specifically we're

138
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,190
gonna

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,008
about our experiment and result under

140
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,919
these three metrics and we will only

141
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:04,610
talk about the experiment we did on IP

142
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:06,599
feeds so first differential contribution

143
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,310
differential contribution of one feed

144
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,740
with respect to another is the

145
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,009
indicators that the first we have has

146
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,050
that the second field doesn't have a

147
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:19,500
measure the additional value one we can

148
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,659
add on top of another and we usually

149
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,030
quantified this by calculating the

150
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:27,120
complement which is the intersection

151
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,419
between two fields and we define the

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,090
intersection rate as the overlap of two

153
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:39,180
feet divided by the size of the first

154
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:43,318
feed and this diagram shows the pairwise

155
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:48,479
intersection rate of all our 47 IP feeds

156
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:51,360
each cell represent a intersection rate

157
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,169
between two feets the darker the cell is

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,340
the higher the intersection rate is the

159
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:01,020
cells that are marked as red are the

160
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,599
comparison between fields within a

161
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,870
category and the ones that are in blue

162
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,789
are the ones that for the two feeds from

163
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:14,159
two different category and if we look at

164
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,560
the diagram we can see that the feeding

165
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,840
skin and blue firs category have good

166
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,490
amount of pairwise intersection which is

167
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,289
pretty good but still above three corner

168
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,310
of their pairwise comparison have an

169
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:31,590
intersection rate less than 15% and for

170
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,450
all the other four category they all

171
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,909
have over 3/4 of their pairwise

172
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:40,229
comparison with the intersection rate

173
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:43,770
less than 1% this means most of the feet

174
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,890
are collecting different stuff and that

175
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,899
brings us a problem if all its feet are

176
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,420
collecting different indicators then

177
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,880
which one should we choose should we

178
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,390
just get them all but how do we know

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,880
that's enough but still remember this is

180
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,260
a student easy case we haven't

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,540
considered the legitimacy of these

182
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,080
indicators yet and that is what we're

183
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,770
gonna talk

184
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,520
next accuracy which estimate the rate of

185
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,860
false positives in each feet false

186
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,260
positives are the data that should not

187
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,350
belong to a feed based on its definition

188
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,120
and it is very difficult to

189
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,510
comprehensively calculate false

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,150
positives with our ground truth data so

191
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:30,980
what we did is we took a conservative

192
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:33,990
approach we calculate a whitelist of IPs

193
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,960
that either should not be included in a

194
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,530
feed or if included will cause

195
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,320
significant disruption and we check how

196
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:48,000
much of our IPS in our feeds overlapped

197
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,250
with our whitelist our wine list

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,130
IPS come from three different source the

199
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,140
first is unrolled by piece where we use

200
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,480
the IPS that were PGP unwrought poll

201
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,390
when they first appeared in a feed and

202
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,440
we get on the daily PGP gospel data from

203
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:06,720
the raw view project the second source

204
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,940
is the laksa top domains where we check

205
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,090
whether the IP in our feeds actually

206
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,610
belong to Alexa top domains and the

207
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,370
things Alexa top lists can churn over

208
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,120
time we only use the domains that are in

209
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,800
the Alexa top 25k for the entire a month

210
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,140
of our experiment period the last source

211
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,569
are the popular cydia networks where we

212
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,150
check whether the IPS in our feeds fall

213
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:37,590
into the IP range of the five popular

214
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:39,510
CDN networks and for the unroll abode

215
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,630
data in most cases they should not

216
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,880
appear in a feed and for the second true

217
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,770
source if they appearing a feet they

218
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,870
will cause disruption because they might

219
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:54,710
hurt legitimate traffic and we compared

220
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,990
all our scan feeds with three different

221
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:01,410
wireless sources and here we give six

222
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,690
example of this extract result the first

223
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,790
column is the feed name the second

224
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,580
column is the percentage of IPS in a

225
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,250
feed that are inaudible the third column

226
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,850
is the number of IP using a feed that

227
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,010
are belongs to top Alexa domains and the

228
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,550
last column is the number of IPS in each

229
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,400
feed

230
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:27,060
belongs to the Sevilla networks in

231
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,699
general among 47 feet 33 feet have at

232
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,030
least one on rollable data and the 13

233
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:37,140
feet have over 1% of their address being

234
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:39,480
on routable and we folder fund that 12

235
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,390
fees have at least the one reserved IPS

236
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,240
the IPS that shall only be used in

237
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,460
private network and in some cases fees

238
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:53,700
can have over hundreds of such reserved

239
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:56,670
IPS and for the other two source 21 fees

240
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,440
have IPS from top black Satomi's and we

241
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,640
have seen some cases where feeds have

242
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:06,900
IPs of github.com dropbox.com or

243
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,840
bing.com and 14 feats have IPS from

244
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,760
popular city and networks and as we can

245
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,040
see from the example some feeds can have

246
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,790
over thousand of IPs belong to severe

247
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,380
networks this implies that potential

248
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,140
false positives in the feeds are

249
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,090
relatively common and we have to keep

250
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:29,430
that in mind when we use this for

251
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:31,410
intelligence data the last matrix we're

252
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,780
gonna talk are the coverage which

253
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:37,469
measure how well our feed covers in 10

254
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,300
days red a perfect coverage will means

255
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,600
it will cover all the indicators that

256
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,120
belong to a threat category but as you

257
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,030
can imagine that's unrealistic for us to

258
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,000
get ground truth for all the threat

259
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,939
activities on internet so we need some

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,140
external data to help us estimate the

261
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,630
coverage and in our experiment we use

262
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,970
the scanners collected from the

263
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:07,110
telescope to estimate the coverage of

264
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:09,270
our scan feeds we use UCSD internet

265
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,060
Haskell which is our monitoring a slash

266
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:15,689
a network and we collect three months of

267
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,599
data from the telescope and we folder

268
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:22,650
use the role ids default configuration

269
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,410
to detect scanners note here that the

270
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,290
telescope doesn't carry any legitimate

271
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,870
traffic so for scanner that have scanned

272
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,430
many telescope eyepiece they are high

273
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,779
likely

274
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,339
indiscriminately scanning the IP space

275
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,800
so we're using the scanner we collected

276
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,620
from the telescope as a base and check

277
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,520
how well our scan feeds covered the

278
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,279
scanners from the telescope and in total

279
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:54,860
we collect over 20 million scanners from

280
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:57,230
the telescope in swing mouse so this

281
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,250
diagram shows the coverage of each scan

282
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,560
feed on different sizes of scanners here

283
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,690
scanner size means the number of

284
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,079
telescope eyepiece the scanner have

285
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,620
scanned within a day so tense all that

286
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:15,380
IP scanner size 10 Sultan will means the

287
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,100
scanner have scanned at least 10,000

288
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,080
telescope eyepiece within a day and we

289
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,630
can see from the graph the detailed IP

290
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,450
feed I'll perform all the other feeds in

291
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,439
the coverage metrics which is pretty

292
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,990
good however if we look at a big picture

293
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,990
the union of all scan feeds add together

294
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,900
only cover less than 2% of the telescope

295
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,330
scanners and even if we only look at the

296
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,720
big scanners the scanner will size over

297
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:48,850
than 10 solvent we still have overall

298
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,830
coverage around 10% this implies that

299
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,230
having a large list of fly intelligence

300
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:57,040
feed doesn't necessarily guarantee a

301
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,040
good coverage

302
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,580
so now it tooks step back we we conduct

303
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,250
our analysis on the threat intelligence

304
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,250
product and we observed low intersection

305
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,339
and low coverage this could be because

306
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,290
several non-exclusive reasons it can be

307
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,480
that the underlying space of indicators

308
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,329
is just so large so each feed can only

309
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,270
stand for a small fraction of it

310
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:24,770
it can also be because different

311
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,199
collection methodology even for the same

312
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,140
cadaveric allegory and up slack a

313
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,620
different sub distribution it's also

314
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,260
possible that not all the threat are

315
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,329
experienced uniformly across the

316
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,459
internet so different people on a

317
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:43,189
different part of internet will observe

318
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,689
different threats and we think the

319
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,920
future research work should look

320
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:53,060
more was actually going on for the

321
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,099
underlying threat landscape and by

322
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,500
analyzing the data we also realized that

323
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,080
blindly using scientist data is unlikely

324
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,090
to provide good coverage and it also

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,730
prone to collateral damage caused by

326
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,880
false positives we think each

327
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,280
organization should fine-tune the data

328
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,830
for specific use cases when they using

329
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,410
threat intelligence data and the future

330
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,870
research should explore more ways to use

331
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:21,670
threat intelligence data other than just

332
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:26,360
use a simple way for the network defense

333
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:29,300
and that's all of this talk and we only

334
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,820
cover a tiny amount of the result we get

335
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,469
from this experiment and for the whole

336
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,510
results please welcome to check our

337
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,510
paper and thank you very much

338
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,570
all right we've a few minutes for

339
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,670
questions

340
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,220
hello my name is Bobo I'm from Facebook

341
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,500
thanks this was super interesting work I

342
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,370
may have missed this while I was trying

343
00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:00,030
to take notes but did you look at the

344
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,930
impact of deletions or removals do feeds

345
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:06,030
regularly prune what they are putting

346
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,369
out because their estimate of the

347
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,050
maliciousness of that IP has changed or

348
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,199
they've acknowledged it's a false

349
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,839
positive how do you deal with that

350
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,540
yeah we we handle that that was actually

351
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,260
under our volume metrics which I didn't

352
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,079
talk in a talk so we check how the

353
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,599
different feeds handle this exploration

354
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,500
exploration and the different fees

355
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,350
handle this differently some fees will

356
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,450
give us straight three months window so

357
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,070
all the data will delete from the feet

358
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:45,030
after three months and some feeds will

359
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:46,830
use a virus expiration window which we

360
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,100
don't know how they decide but we

361
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,889
observe different xvalue window for the

362
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,980
indicators and there even some other

363
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:59,070
feed which don't do this at all they

364
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:02,610
just tell you this is the malicious IP

365
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:04,980
we found last week and it is up to you

366
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,469
to decide when you need to expire your

367
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,030
data and so how did you control for the

368
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,680
false positive rates when you were

369
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,770
finding that with these different

370
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:17,750
expiration policies yes so we only look

371
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:21,950
at the data that shows up first time

372
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,960
yeah so we handle that thank you yeah

373
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,150
yeah nice talk my name is shir brown

374
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,340
from USC I have a question with respect

375
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,710
to your ground truth evaluation and

376
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,990
false positive estimates Vitalik sir yes

377
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,370
sir I was wondering like don't you think

378
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,920
that there might be some cases where

379
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,050
there are actual malicious websites

380
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,040
which get into that Excel top 25k and

381
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,669
they're getting loose in the blackness

382
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,230
did you observe any yes I mean it's

383
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,350
possible that there are actually

384
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,780
malicious and it's hard for us to argue

385
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,649
like is this comprehensive enough

386
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,350
so that's why what we did here is we use

387
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,040
the domains that are staying the Alexa

388
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:04,830
top list across the entire a month to

389
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,889
ensure that this is indeed a popular

390
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,870
site so even if this is a Malaysian site

391
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,680
they are definitely popular sites and

392
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:17,129
that's how we minimize the potential

393
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:20,100
force caused by this experiment hi a

394
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,290
great great talk and very relevant South

395
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,570
Sudan from Columbia University so just

396
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,120
to follow up on that question so we've

397
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,040
also often seen attacks where people in

398
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,429
bed let's say malware on a file-sharing

399
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,480
site like a Dropbox or than many other

400
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:36,240
competitors which are gonna be in the

401
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,250
25k or they take over you know they

402
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,920
compromise a specific page in an

403
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,770
otherwise legitimate website so how do

404
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,190
you control for that yeah so that's why

405
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,050
we say this is like collateral damage

406
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,900
this will cause collateral damage

407
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:56,190
yes those file sharing like senior

408
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:59,610
networks kind of thing can be be abuse

409
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:03,060
with malicious well if you just blindly

410
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,699
use the IPS to block traffic you might

411
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,159
block legitimate traffic so in this case

412
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,320
you cannot just look at the IPS you need

413
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,450
more information to fine-tune your data

414
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,550
and that's well why we said in the end

415
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,830
we need to find him for specific use

416
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,450
cases

417
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,659
all right let's think better one more

418
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,660
time

419
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,100
you
