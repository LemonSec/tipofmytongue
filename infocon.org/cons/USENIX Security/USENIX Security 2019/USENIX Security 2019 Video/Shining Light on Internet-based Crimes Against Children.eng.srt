1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,880
this talk is gonna discuss some pretty

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,369
frank topics if you wandered in here not

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,220
knowing what's coming you might want to

4
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,779
consider leaving in the next few slides

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,790
so I work on internet-based crimes

6
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:28,009
against children I have since about 2008

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,799
I've been in the field of networking and

8
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,540
network security since well I graduated

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,950
with a PhD in 1999 and ever since then

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,700
I've been at UMass and so this talk is

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,910
gonna try to have a conversation that's

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,340
not been had so let's do that so here's

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,468
an outline of my talk I'm gonna give you

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,579
a pretty frank and deep background on

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,929
internet-based

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,460
child sexual exploitation I'm gonna talk

17
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,410
about the tension I mean I can't do this

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,510
especially at this venue without talking

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,358
about the as as Alissa said the privacy

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,309
owed to victims and free speech right as

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,250
I'm gonna talk in depth about this is a

22
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:07,730
huge dilemma I don't have a solution I

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,550
don't think I don't think we can address

24
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,960
this without a frank discussion about

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,030
the limitations here and put everything

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,679
on the table so I'm also going to tell

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,790
you ahead of time that this is an invite

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
to talk and so I get to have an opinion

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,850
so my opinion is that torrent and

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,979
services are not on balance a win okay

31
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,619
and so let's put out some caveats here

32
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,600
the first is let's be careful to

33
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,460
distinguish tor onion services from the

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,229
tor browser so I'm going to try and be

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,059
really careful about that in my talk and

36
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,210
I hope if you have questions for me at

37
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,509
the end you might you might do the same

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:43,610
okay some some other caveats are all

39
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:46,399
opinions here are solely my own not

40
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,380
anybody else's I work with a great team

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,670
of very talented people but I'm kind of

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,649
leaving their names out on purpose so

43
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,539
that if you disagree you can disagree

44
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,180
with just me I'm gonna show you as many

45
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,250
statistics as I can in this talk for any

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,109
slide that I have up I'll put a URL in

47
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,189
the corner and that there's no paper to

48
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,350
go along with this talk I thought that

49
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,508
might help provide some source material

50
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,269
but there's no statistics here that are

51
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,800
official releases I'm not I'm not a

52
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,660
member of any agency I'm not law

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,830
enforcement or anything like that and I

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,910
wouldn't reference them in any sort of

55
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,650
meaningful manner but I think they're

56
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,160
going to inform our discussion so just

57
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,540
to repeat you know the big trigger

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,130
warning right I mean this is going to be

59
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,840
the most candid talk you've ever seen on

60
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,640
this topic because it's

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,989
ever done ever and I think people

62
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,149
especially in this community don't

63
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,830
really know what's out there it's just

64
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,900
kind of a topic it's a topic that's very

65
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,180
painful and really nobody wants to talk

66
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,790
about in general like outside of this

67
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,540
room outside of this community it's some

68
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,040
horrible stuff

69
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,379
okay so let's begin here is child sexual

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,780
abuse material actually illegal not

71
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,579
universally it turns out there's a great

72
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,670
group called the International Center

73
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,470
for Missing and Exploited Children for

74
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,750
well over a decade since 2006 I guess

75
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,430
they've been doing great surveys of

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,049
legislation that exists among the let's

77
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,420
say what I think it's 196 countries

78
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:09,260
around the world their first edition was

79
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,109
in 2006 and at that point they looking

80
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,239
around discovered that only five

81
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,640
countries had what they call strong

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,290
legislation whereas twenty-seven of them

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,879
at the time had what their labeling

84
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,870
sufficient they were sort of missing an

85
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:26,179
important law and actually 95 countries

86
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,639
had no legislation at all which is just

87
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,230
really wonderful 136 of them didn't

88
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,730
criminalize possession but did

89
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,319
criminalize distribution

90
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,420
okay so there's some there's some

91
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,458
subtleties here and if you're into

92
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,230
security because of policy this is a

93
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,900
great area to look into things have

94
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,179
really changed I sort of made this bar

95
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,069
chart myself or I should say line chart

96
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,049
just looking through the editions of

97
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,638
their report on things have changed

98
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:51,739
quite a bit I mean it's not that great

99
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,750
according to their metrics 21 countries

100
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,389
only 21 I mean that's better than five

101
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,849
have strong legislation at this point 38

102
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,069
still do not criminalize possession 16

103
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:03,168
still have no legislation at all but at

104
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,569
least 118 I've met this sort of minimal

105
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:07,220
viability that they've put together okay

106
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,910
but certainly in the u.s. it's

107
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,290
definitely legal illegal and let's talk

108
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,450
about what happens here

109
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,820
so I also want to be clear I'm not

110
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,250
talking about sexting between teens I'm

111
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,719
not talking about first-year college

112
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,530
students going back and dating their

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,750
highschool boyfriend or girlfriend

114
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,219
police law enforcement investigators of

115
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,130
this crime are concerned about the

116
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,680
youngest of children and images and

117
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,360
videos that are created from their rape

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,830
and abuse and I mean the youngest I'm

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,700
talking

120
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:42,070
infants and toddlers okay so if you're a

121
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,440
perpetrator of this crime you will

122
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,180
create this material and that's where

123
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,340
the problem begins right possession is

124
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,440
you know really the start of this and

125
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,989
the Internet has made this more

126
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,340
distributable than ever before it's a I

127
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,710
mean we all know this right it's a

128
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,780
global network and things start to

129
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,430
exacerbate from there there's plenty of

130
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,200
public forums to share this in what's

131
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,710
happened more recently and I'll get into

132
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,539
depth about this is that perpetrators

133
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,760
have organized themselves into pro

134
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,160
offending subcultures they found

135
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,900
themselves online and they're training

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,030
each other and how to do this they're

137
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,810
training each other and how to avoid

138
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,599
detection

139
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,580
training each other on how to how to

140
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,710
perpetrate this crime and then they're

141
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,630
normalizing the the behavior among

142
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,640
themselves right like if you feel like

143
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,740
you're something that nobody else is and

144
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,810
then you find somebody who believes that

145
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,920
you've normalized the behavior and you

146
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:42,490
feel good about it okay so so technology

147
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,710
distributed systems that enable a pro

148
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,960
offending subculture to bound to bind

149
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,510
together are a force multiplier for this

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,430
problem okay so now that that's there

151
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,890
those things together cause another

152
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,010
problem and that's persistence images

153
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,780
that are placed online stay there right

154
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,580
like people who do this there's various

155
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,020
reasons that they do this there's deep

156
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,210
psychology here that I'm certainly not

157
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,330
an expert in some people are obsessed

158
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,989
with collection collecting these images

159
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,490
in a way that mimics almost hoarding in

160
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,230
a way I don't I'm not a sociologist on

161
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,330
you want to label it in any way but in

162
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,800
any case that coupled with the very

163
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,120
resilient I mean we're really good at

164
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,710
what we do right we've built very

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,050
resilient storage systems distributed

166
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,000
systems and these images tend to stay

167
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,430
online okay and so that's going to be a

168
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,100
problem so also the offending as I

169
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,380
mentioned or as I alluded to the the

170
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,090
organized subculture of offenders have

171
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,190
taught each other how to groom children

172
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,349
so what does that mean I mean you need

173
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,880
to normalize this behavior not just not

174
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,500
just to yourself as an offender but you

175
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,659
need to make it normal to a child you

176
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,890
need to show them images that makes it

177
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,850
seem like people do this all the time

178
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,890
don't worry about it it's very normal

179
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,840
so what happens once you've been groomed

180
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,370
I mean not only you abused and then

181
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,719
you're gonna be back in I don't want to

182
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,480
call it a cycle but you're back to

183
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,370
creation creating your your you know

184
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,760
these crimes against you are some of

185
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,620
what gets created here your infrared

186
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,620
ease have shown a life of pain right I

187
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,140
mean ongoing psychosis very difficult to

188
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,690
recover from and then you might end up

189
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,880
being trafficked as a child or as an

190
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,370
adult and then the cycle continues so

191
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,350
this is kind of the ecosystem here it's

192
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,300
not just about hey you've got this

193
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,860
picture how horrible you have to put

194
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,130
yourself into perspective of the victim

195
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,690
here okay so to really drive this home

196
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,580
because this is not going to be an easy

197
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,740
talk to sit through I want to read this

198
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,210
statement which was submitted to a court

199
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,650
case so this is a public document I

200
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,780
didn't actually provide the URL for this

201
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,190
because I I still feel a little bit iffy

202
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,619
about it the URL at the bottom is to a

203
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:43,760
really really excellent article by Emily

204
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,810
Bazelon who's this fantastic writer in

205
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,289
part for the New York Times Magazine

206
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,330
there's a URL there but anyway so this

207
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,860
says my uncle started to abuse me when I

208
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,390
was only four years old at first he

209
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,830
showed me pornographic movies and then

210
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,080
he started doing things to me right what

211
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,109
is this this is grooming where are those

212
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,580
images from online there's a lot I don't

213
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,170
remember but now I can't forget because

214
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,640
the disgusting images of what he did to

215
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,740
me are still out there and the internet

216
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,140
that's persistence this is from an adult

217
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,780
right this is surviving the abuse into

218
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,430
adulthood every day that I live and that

219
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,960
every day of my life I live in constant

220
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,370
fear that someone will see my pictures

221
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,380
and recognize me and then I will be

222
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,670
humiliated all over I mean I think we

223
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,500
all share our notion being at this

224
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,060
conference in this particular field it's

225
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,890
uncomfortable to socialize with people

226
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,960
right like sometimes at this conference

227
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,010
or wherever you are you're not really

228
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,659
sure who's in the room and whether you

229
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,159
want to talk to them imagine like every

230
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,690
day of your life every time you went to

231
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,280
a room wondering whether these strangers

232
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,760
have seen these pictures of this

233
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,500
horrible crime I often Icona sometimes

234
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,210
wonder about like we care so much about

235
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,190
medical records and the fact that they

236
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,350
don't get out what if the video of your

237
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,330
session with the doctor was online what

238
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,100
if a video of like you being abused was

239
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,740
online I mean this is such an amazingly

240
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,530
hard problem this is you know a show of

241
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,510
pain and you know I do not choose to be

242
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,770
there but now I am there forever I want

243
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,600
it all to be erased I mean this is

244
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,260
someone who needs our help and this is a

245
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,690
privacy

246
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,240
sensitive community this is a privacy

247
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,330
issue right child abuse child sexual

248
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,890
abuse and the inseparable notion of what

249
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,510
the Internet has provided to that is a

250
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,580
privacy issue that we should all care

251
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,130
about okay so what can we do about that

252
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,300
so another sort of little secret that

253
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,620
doesn't I don't know if it's a secret

254
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,569
but another thing that really doesn't

255
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,720
get written up at all is that anytime

256
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,540
you put up a social network of any kind

257
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,040
big or small anyone you are allowed and

258
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,480
you give out free services because you

259
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,280
want to drive up the number of users

260
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,290
people are going to use that for various

261
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,480
things I mean we all know that criminals

262
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,730
are early adopters for everything so

263
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,620
every tech company out there has a group

264
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,120
of people quite honestly I don't think

265
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,070
they publicize this because they don't

266
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,600
want their products to be associated but

267
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,180
that group of people looks through

268
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,040
pretty much required by law for child

269
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,810
sexual exploitation images and takes

270
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,370
them down and then reports the people

271
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,380
that are out there so Facebook has an

272
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,460
amazing group on this Microsoft has an

273
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,290
amazing group Microsoft has done

274
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,870
fantastic work especially with Hanif or

275
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,959
Reid who's really um just amazing work

276
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,600
to help this issue and then they filter

277
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,310
right so I don't recommend you do this

278
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,760
at home but this is what happens if you

279
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,349
google child pornography on Google and

280
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,420
you will not find child pornography they

281
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,160
will filter the results out and then I

282
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,719
love this somebody took out this ad I

283
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,459
wonder if this is someone actually paid

284
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,870
for this or Google just puts it up there

285
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,310
child abuse imagery is illegal if you

286
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,140
see it report it right so a little bit

287
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,660
of a warning there so filtering helps

288
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,500
right helps prevent a community from

289
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,569
being formed

290
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,580
who else filters well it turns out that

291
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,860
the Pirate Bay org filters right this

292
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,330
first bastion of free speech that we're

293
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,850
gonna get into if you search for the

294
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,800
term child porn on the Pirate Bay you'll

295
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,840
end up with this infamous case which

296
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,400
let's not get into that but you won't

297
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,310
get torrents that involve child

298
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,660
pornography where else can we go we

299
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,520
could go to Reddit right so this is

300
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,980
again URL at the bottom here these are

301
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,439
comments from the general manager of

302
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,390
Reddit number of years ago talking about

303
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,840
some of the difficulties they have in in

304
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:03,020
organizing a site that has such loose

305
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,300
free speech policies and what that

306
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,250
person talked about was well you know

307
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,900
sometimes we have more morally

308
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,480
questionable reddit's like jailbait

309
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,800
jailbait is the name of the reddit there

310
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,970
and that's part of the price of free

311
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,949
speech right that's often a

312
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,600
argument we as technologists will say

313
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:18,740
we'll say I'm doing this great thing

314
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,569
it's really important

315
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,310
I'm giving people good performance good

316
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,540
security but you know there's going to

317
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,339
be a cost that's just part of the game

318
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,889
right we'll solve it down the road or

319
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,509
don't don't hamper my technology it will

320
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,040
work out in the end don't want early

321
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,480
regulation things like that well it

322
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
turns out that for various reasons at

323
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,930
some point reddit changed their mind

324
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,250
right some of this had to do with there

325
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,050
was a maybe we weren't following this

326
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,269
but there was a lot of talk at some

327
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,269
point about what is it called revenge

328
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,670
pornography right putting up images of

329
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,170
someone you've dated and then you know

330
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,459
to take revenge on them and so they

331
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,599
changed the policy I think it parts of

332
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,160
that but I honestly don't know when they

333
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,740
changed it but this is the new policy

334
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,779
and of course not of course but now

335
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,540
suddenly they specifically list no

336
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,250
involuntary pornography but also you

337
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,529
can't have sexual or even suggestive

338
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,209
content involving minors so maybe not

339
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:07,519
this but varies people at various times

340
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,410
have been upset with reddit's filtering

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,149
of the content that's on there and they

342
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,379
formed various communities maybe not

343
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,180
even read it but people have formed

344
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,620
other communities out there one of them

345
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,540
is gap if you're familiar with that

346
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,220
turns out the gap actually filters

347
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,649
obscenity and pornography part of their

348
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,389
terms of use who else why don't we go

349
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,819
over to vote vote is pretty permissive

350
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:27,740
what turns out no illegal content there

351
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,559
how about what everyone no the next one

352
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm gonna go to 4chan 4chan it's like a

353
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,610
free-for-all for free speech but what's

354
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,040
the policy if you don't know those terms

355
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,319
that's little and I mean little boys and

356
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,029
little girls so no child pornography and

357
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,709
then they even raise the bar from there

358
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:44,209
I mean I love that they even use these

359
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:46,399
terms like they just expect that their

360
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,739
users are apparently you know understand

361
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
that but anyway no absolutely no

362
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,670
underage content under 18 of any sort

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,769
and then where's the last place you can

364
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,339
go it's not quite the last place we'll

365
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,740
get to that

366
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,129
hñ right do we all know HN it's been in

367
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,660
the news lately what do we know about hm

368
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:05,540
free speech community very serious about

369
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:08,240
it why were they in the news because

370
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:12,439
someone took a gun in New Zealand and

371
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,660
shot 51 people in a mosque what did that

372
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,639
person do first they post it there

373
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,059
whatever whatever they had to say they

374
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,980
posted it to a chant okay a little while

375
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:23,540
later somebody went to a synagogue I

376
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,470
believe this was in San Diego if I have

377
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,829
this correct posted to a chan before

378
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,740
they did

379
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,810
that very recently a couple weeks ago

380
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,030
maybe not even a lot of people were

381
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,670
killed in El Paso what did the person do

382
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:41,180
post it to a channel at a time okay so

383
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,520
HN is really in the news lately kind of

384
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,530
having a lot of problems and what could

385
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,210
be done right because ISPs are not

386
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,610
responsible for the content of the

387
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,070
forum's that they are supporting right

388
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,240
definitely i speeds gonna stay away here

389
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,310
because they don't want to get into

390
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,520
editorializing what takes place on their

391
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:01,910
forums but what happened finally an isp

392
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,280
had enough right so this is p CloudFlare

393
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,780
said after from what I can read I don't

394
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,600
know anyone a CloudFlare it I certainly

395
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,189
don't know this gentleman who's the CEO

396
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,900
but seem to have really deliberated this

397
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,760
internally as far as I can tell and then

398
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,280
at some point decided to stop supporting

399
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,840
HM why and I want you to pay attention

400
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,709
to why here because this will come up

401
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,470
later in the talk

402
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,930
because HN ignored warnings and by the

403
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,520
way I'm here today for well I'm here to

404
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,140
tell you as a friend right this is like

405
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,870
everything I'm saying today is like what

406
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,040
everyone outside of this community and

407
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,520
I'm not pointing to anyone in particular

408
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,260
I'm just like it's as if nobody everyone

409
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,150
else in the world knows this but other

410
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,090
people don't okay so anyway ignored

411
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,770
warnings and tolerated hate and what's

412
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,160
tolerance by the way tolerance is not

413
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,720
advocating hate right it's tolerating it

414
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,370
saying well if you're gonna hate that

415
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,170
I'm if you're gonna be involved in hate

416
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm not going to stop you okay so that's

417
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,760
why they pulled their support they said

418
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,010
that they that 8chan seem to be willing

419
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,990
to ignore laws against violence incite

420
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,050
men in order to avoid moderating its

421
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,620
platform that realization along with

422
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,689
multiple mass murders tip the scale at

423
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,280
CloudFlare and then I love this quote if

424
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,530
we see a bad thing in the world and we

425
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,360
can't help get and we can help get in

426
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,829
front of it we have some obligation to

427
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,540
do that and so they pulled their support

428
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,130
and so this is like a huge deal this

429
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,449
starts the dilemma that we're gonna go

430
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,980
down right I mean this is where it's

431
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,990
gonna start to get hard because this is

432
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,610
a free speech issue and so there's lots

433
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,800
of articles I put up here could have put

434
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,150
up here about free speech problems but

435
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,469
I'm gonna get to this later in the talk

436
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,160
I didn't want to bring up this other one

437
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,260
I love this

438
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,939
the 8chan people were like what can we

439
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,250
do now we need a new ice P and by the

440
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,320
way they found one but in the meantime

441
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,120
they started using a peer-to-peer

442
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,450
network to host themselves and then what

443
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
happened

444
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,470
the hn users were very disturbed because

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,970
they noticed that the site they were

446
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,460
using actually had some boards that

447
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,440
clearly hosted child pornography the hn

448
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,090
people freaked out and then they got off

449
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,440
that site okay and it turns out that if

450
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,570
you look into it what are the rules of

451
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,460
hn there's only a couple rules one of

452
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,020
them is no obscenity in fact they're

453
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,470
quite proud of this they've deleted and

454
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,630
banned rooms that /cp Wright taught

455
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,690
stands for child pornography slash pedo

456
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,430
pedophilia globe I love this globally hn

457
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,080
has had an average turnaround time of

458
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,630
only one hour for deleting obscene

459
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,520
images from from minors this is forty

460
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,630
eight meaning 48 hours normally for Nick

461
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,760
Nick which is the National Center for

462
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,070
Missing Exploited Children fantastic

463
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,150
organization by the way and then they

464
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,830
even warn you if you're thinking of

465
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,660
posting illegal content to H n please

466
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,690
think again we will not protect you okay

467
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,260
so yeah H n has its limits too all right

468
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,790
so where do we go from here how do you

469
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,260
solve this problem how do you address it

470
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,640
right we're going to get into other

471
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,080
issues that come up but you may be

472
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,900
wondering like what do you do about this

473
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,220
well this is a law enforcement issue

474
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,500
right like you have to if you want to

475
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,930
protect children like what do you do so

476
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,940
very coarsely and this is a very I'm

477
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,109
really making things very simplified

478
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,850
here but there's kind of just two

479
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,620
strategies let's just say two classes of

480
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,110
strategies you can go with you can have

481
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,370
a passive strategy as a law enforcement

482
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,320
investigator and that's where you wait

483
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,750
for tips to come in you rely on the

484
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,880
community to report things to you if you

485
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,560
know of a particular child who's being

486
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,290
abused you can go for example in the

487
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,240
u.s. to cybertip org that's a government

488
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,970
or I think maybe it's Nick Nick but it's

489
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,460
a put out by the anyway it's a place you

490
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,630
should go there's cyber tips and other

491
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,270
countries as well if you're from another

492
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,980
country and this can be because you've

493
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,119
discovered your neighbor maybe you're a

494
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,650
teacher and you recognize something

495
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,169
about a child maybe it's someone in your

496
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,670
family and this has been wildly

497
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,470
successful this is the latest data I

498
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,850
could find put out by the government you

499
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,830
can see the number of tips that they've

500
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,580
received from this website and other

501
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:39,889
ways local and state and federal

502
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,600
agencies in the u.s. work really hard so

503
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,010
on these cases they're completely

504
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,070
understaffed we'll get to that in a

505
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,320
minute under fund it you can see this

506
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,570
tremendous rise in 2015 which was many

507
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,189
years ago ninety thousand cyber tips

508
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,360
came in specifically for child sexual

509
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,780
abuse okay

510
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,969
so what's

511
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,440
problem with this it doesn't work for

512
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,450
children who have yet to be discovered

513
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,400
it doesn't work for children who have

514
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,050
been silenced by fear that's definitely

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,030
part of the grooming process don't talk

516
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,440
about this right that's definitely one

517
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,600
of the first things you'll hear and it

518
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,340
doesn't work for kids who don't yet talk

519
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,959
or are unable to speak okay so what else

520
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,370
can you do is law enforcement how do you

521
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,030
solve that well what you do is you take

522
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,409
on proactive investigations okay so I'm

523
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,879
really gonna simplify a lot of stuff

524
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,420
here this is you know how you actually

525
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,650
do this is really you really have to be

526
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,540
careful about this there's a lot of

527
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,730
policies there's a lot of US law

528
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,379
involved here this is forensics this is

529
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,580
digital forensics there's a science to

530
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,780
it you got to do it right I don't have

531
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,149
time to get into that into this talk

532
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,800
well let's just say broadly you get in a

533
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,180
public forum I mean this is how you bust

534
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,850
people and drugs if you wanted to go

535
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,710
down to the park late at night wait for

536
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,360
people to offer you drugs right get on a

537
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,940
public forum and say does anyone here

538
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,100
have child child sexual abuse material

539
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,750
you wouldn't say it that way and then

540
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,969
someone says I've got it and you say

541
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,470
well can I have it and they say sure why

542
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,760
don't you download it for me and then

543
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,400
they'll say by the way here's a

544
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,810
cryptographic identifier that ensures

545
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
that you've got the right thing I mean

546
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,540
there's no way to mess up here but in

547
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,649
any case you download it you can

548
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,770
visually inspect it as a law enforcement

549
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,380
officer and this will again a lighting a

550
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,000
lot of process here will be what goes

551
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,340
into among other things a search warrant

552
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,050
you'll visit their house and ideally

553
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,870
you'll actually rescue a child right I

554
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,190
mean you know there's a funny thing here

555
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,870
if you don't find a child there's a

556
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,640
viewpoint that like you got there before

557
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,500
the child was abused before the person

558
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
escalated beyond just looking at

559
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,520
pictures to actually abusing a child but

560
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,920
the other viewpoint is well at least you

561
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,290
rescued a child okay so why would you do

562
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,390
this as I'm sort of intimating here

563
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,100
possession is correlated with contact

564
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,770
offenses there's studies that back this

565
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,810
up I've done a study that looked at at

566
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,300
the time of arrest what percentage of

567
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,230
those arrests involved people who were

568
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,700
contact offenders which means they were

569
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,140
sexually abusing children they had

570
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,900
physical contact with the child and not

571
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,370
just images and it's something let's say

572
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,150
15 percent I'll come back to this for

573
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,850
one slide later

574
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,290
now Michael bork and his collaborators

575
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,389
have done much better work than I have

576
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,120
really fantastic work they looked at

577
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,720
offenders many years after arrest which

578
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,000
is fascinating because many years out

579
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,710
to rest there's time for people to come

580
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,990
forward who might have been hesitant at

581
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,789
first right the child will finally come

582
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,320
forward right other things will be on

583
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:20,140
earth the the person will come to terms

584
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,210
with counselling in prison about what

585
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,610
they may have done in some cases so

586
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,679
Bork's studies have found that you know

587
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,689
these are the rate so I said you know at

588
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,429
the time of arrest 15 percent his

589
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,590
studies find that depending on the study

590
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,690
it's north of 50 percent at times I

591
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,340
believe it's a 87 percent of the people

592
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,429
he investigated these are among people

593
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,350
who have been arrested okay so this is

594
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,150
great because this strategy allows you

595
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,918
to rescue those infants and toddlers

596
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,340
those who are silenced those who can't

597
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,710
speak and you and you know I'm sorry for

598
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,549
this one but this is this is this is

599
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,990
gonna okay so in San Diego 2006 before I

600
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,100
got involved in any of this so I'm not

601
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:05,409
responsible for any of this but some

602
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,418
some great investigators are wayneb

603
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,919
laylee I think his name is was an

604
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:11,590
employee of the San Diego Children's

605
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,150
Hospital for health our Hospital and

606
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,209
Health Center where he worked in the

607
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,260
convalescent facility for ten years

608
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,450
those patients and we're talking

609
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,299
children here generally can't feed bathe

610
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,390
or dress themselves and so he was caught

611
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,679
molesting children in this ward and you

612
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,150
know in New York he was looking at the

613
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,980
window and the invested the investigator

614
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,270
said you know how many children did you

615
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,250
molest and he was looking out at the

616
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,990
snow and he said how many snowflakes are

617
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,760
there out there later he admitted to

618
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,260
abusing about two kids a week he

619
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,210
specifically chose children who were the

620
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,158
most brain-damaged most comatose most

621
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,840
nonverbal children who could never say

622
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,909
anything about it how was this guy

623
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,740
caught he was caught because someone did

624
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:49,929
a proactive investigation on a public

625
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,179
forum and found his IP address and found

626
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:53,980
their way to his home like this was

627
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:58,150
never gonna be found right this guy's I

628
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:00,760
think it's 45 years in prison okay I got

629
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,020
involved in 2008 I I can't fit

630
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,330
everything into this talk so I'm really

631
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,129
gonna kind of leave out my stuff but

632
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,830
we've worked really hard in my lab I

633
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:11,350
work with just the best people and we've

634
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,740
created forensically reliable tools to

635
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,539
give we don't sell anything but we give

636
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,679
it to law enforcement we help provide

637
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,179
the training I work with another

638
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,620
organization that provides the training

639
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,130
they're among the best people I've ever

640
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,530
met

641
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,000
and we train people appropriately we

642
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,830
work with prosecutors and we catch

643
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,990
people they catch people I provide the

644
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,060
tools my group provides the tools so

645
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,970
this outstanding gentleman was found in

646
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,220
Wyoming he was sentenced for possession

647
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,150
of at the time the largest collection of

648
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,290
child pornography forty-seven terabytes

649
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,540
nineteen point five year sentence

650
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,760
seventeen million files prior conviction

651
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,800
and sexual assault on a child he was

652
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,940
topped more recently by this gentleman

653
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,800
and he this has not gone to trial yet

654
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,840
but in any case when he was arrested he

655
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,180
had 58 terabytes related to child

656
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,770
pornography that's a lot of that's a lot

657
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,150
of images okay which also gives you a

658
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,530
sense of the scale of what's going on

659
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,870
here it's not like one or two kids or

660
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,350
something this guy is from Jersey County

661
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,449
Illinois

662
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,820
he's only been charged hasn't gone to

663
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,980
trial yet he was recording himself in

664
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,290
sex acts with a seven-year-old boy okay

665
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,220
spent decades more than a decade anyway

666
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,629
doing this in online forums okay so you

667
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,610
might be thinking well Brian just giving

668
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,010
anecdotal examples one of the things

669
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,600
that our research has done this is a lot

670
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,030
of this is very public so we got out

671
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,189
there and we measured this I mean that's

672
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,780
what computer science are good at so we

673
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,730
did it and so in the US I can tell you

674
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,560
for a subset of the venues that are out

675
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,290
there this doesn't include any darknet

676
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,990
traffic it's something like on the left

677
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,840
here it says grids and the bottom here

678
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,880
is over time and grids is a grid and so

679
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,040
it's not an IP address we did some

680
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,380
estimation here for how you convert this

681
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,510
into unique computers unique computers

682
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,650
are still not people so I think your

683
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,450
computer scientists you can kind of

684
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,940
understand that so this is something

685
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,620
north of 40,000 per month unique

686
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,270
computers involved in known child

687
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,159
pornography just in the US doesn't

688
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,710
include forms we can't see publicly

689
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,110
doesn't include unknown or as yet

690
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,310
unknown as yet until you know child

691
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,919
pornography that's unknown to law

692
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:17,320
enforcement that's a lot why is this

693
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,790
going down I wish I'd love to say it's

694
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,960
going down because the excellent and

695
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,420
very difficult work that law enforcement

696
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,660
do I mean this is a very hard crime to

697
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,960
investigate I'm fortunate I'm I have no

698
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,910
special ability to possess or view or be

699
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,980
in receipt of child pornography so I've

700
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,030
I've never seen any of it but law

701
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,000
enforcement have a difficult

702
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,430
psychological time

703
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,110
with this and they do a fantastic job

704
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,450
doing with it so why is it gone down

705
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,649
maybe they're doing great work here and

706
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,720
people are being pushed off these

707
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,160
networks but I think people are just

708
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,020
going elsewhere unfortunately cuz

709
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
there's only I didn't actually bring a

710
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,780
stat on this but it's something like

711
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,560
three to five thousand arrests per year

712
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,860
in the u.s.

713
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,300
okay so forty thousand three to five

714
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,800
thousand it's not it's not really good

715
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,840
so here's another this is all just

716
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,639
publicly available data the each one of

717
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,230
these points is an IP address and it's

718
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,610
just geo located it's not like someone's

719
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,490
home or anything it's just the center of

720
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,350
some zip code estimated by some service

721
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,420
or something but this is unique IP

722
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,219
addresses in 30 minutes and public

723
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,280
venues sharing known child pornography

724
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,720
this is one hour this is six hours

725
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,430
there's some tension here if you know

726
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,860
one person may have their IP address

727
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,020
reassigned so that's why there's the

728
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,429
time thing there if you're not from the

729
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,379
US or maybe if you don't know and you

730
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,600
aren't from the US this is just actually

731
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,370
the population density of the US right

732
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,699
this is where people live I mean a lot

733
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,350
of people are doing this all the time

734
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,060
okay worldwide this is not just a

735
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,480
massive problem it's a massive global

736
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:44,000
problem so this is again us updating

737
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,820
statistics from an old paper but eighty

738
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,620
eight hundred thousand grids worldwide

739
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,139
sharing known child pornography in

740
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:56,239
public forums right this is a massive

741
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:58,580
massive problem okay so what do you do I

742
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,720
mean you you get online you're a cop and

743
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,919
there's just eight hundred thousand

744
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,210
people I mean most of them are not in

745
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,540
your jurisdiction but what do you do

746
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,920
next

747
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,389
do you need some method of triage you

748
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,630
need to decide who's the most dangerous

749
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:11,000
person that I'd like to spend my time

750
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,440
investigating to make a case for to go

751
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,320
in front of a judge to have a search

752
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,060
warrant to have proper legal process and

753
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,500
so on so one of the things we did for

754
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,450
example is we looked at the least severe

755
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,620
child pornography I I love how I would

756
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,390
only have terms for this I'm not

757
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,330
comparing an adult pornography to child

758
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,800
pornography also by the way it's it's

759
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,750
not even pornography right it's really

760
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,970
child sexual abuse material but anyway

761
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,550
we compared arrests we did this very

762
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,510
carefully with this wonderful

763
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,940
sociologist named Janice Wallach who's

764
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,220
incredible and what we looked at is like

765
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,929
for arrests if you were arrested and

766
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,150
online what you shared was the least

767
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,740
severe child sex abuse material which

768
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,200
involves just nudity masturbation or

769
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,080
adolescent sex of minors again very

770
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,850
young children then 15 percent of the

771
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,949
time those people were either at the at

772
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,409
the time found to be contact offenders

773
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,680
or in their past but the cases of people

774
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:07,770
who were sharing the most severe child

775
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,120
sex abuse material that involves sexual

776
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,000
assault of infants and toddlers or

777
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,280
sadistic acts it jumps to double 30%

778
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
right so that gives you a clue I mean

779
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,980
there's some more science to be done

780
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,449
here like was it the case that those

781
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,480
people who were found with the most

782
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,070
severe files were the cops sort of

783
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,660
frustrated and we're like I'm pulling

784
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:29,189
out all the stops like one of the things

785
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:30,570
they could do is work harder and you

786
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,980
know interviewing the person I mean

787
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,419
there's lots of stuff that could happen

788
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,940
here that would influence the behavior

789
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,290
of the investigator so anyway again I

790
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,730
want to point to Michael Bork doing some

791
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,770
great work that really separates out

792
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,970
some of the issues here like you know I

793
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,200
don't want to claim that this is done

794
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,790
yet but that's some of the things you

795
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,830
could do is develops forensic techniques

796
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,930
and methods for law enforcement in a

797
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:52,139
rigorous scientific way to help them do

798
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:54,860
this cause okay all right so now let's

799
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,300
switch a little bit and talk about

800
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,409
darkness right dark nuts a little bit

801
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,649
different than the venues I've been

802
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,840
talking about so there's a lot in

803
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,320
academia but the deployed ones are

804
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,760
really free net tor and let's say i2p

805
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,740
let's talk about free net first here's a

806
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,180
view on free net some of you may have

807
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,740
never heard of free net it's an academic

808
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,560
paper that came out in the year I think

809
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,900
2000 or 2001 it still exists it's been

810
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,139
kicking this whole time why is it out

811
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,540
there

812
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,980
well let's you know if you're not

813
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,129
familiar with free net it's very much

814
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,390
like a hidden service or I guess it's

815
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,550
now called an onion service right so

816
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,260
it's not a proxy to the internet it's

817
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,960
just things you can get that were

818
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,940
previously inserted into free net it's

819
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,250
it's sort of there's a lot to say here

820
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,680
but it kind of supports other

821
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,700
applications so one of the things that

822
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,710
supports is a newsgroup

823
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,390
like application you can see the

824
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:50,580
wonderful news groups on there on the

825
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:53,010
left including where is it

826
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,159
toddler CP they're near the bottom tor

827
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:58,080
child porn is a category there and this

828
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,250
is the offender community I was talking

829
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,070
about this is actually a completely

830
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,630
textual site this purse

831
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,789
says are there any videos to go with

832
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,500
these pics especially the last one I

833
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,940
think these are Kelly videos right I

834
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,350
mean this is a particular series that

835
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,149
this person is trying to collect and

836
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,678
then they're there asking for help right

837
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,809
this is the community talking to one

838
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,899
another free nuts enabling this here's a

839
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:20,918
particular very cropped bottom of a site

840
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:23,360
on Freenet these are called free sites

841
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,279
there's an average of 60 photos per

842
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,168
gathering we update every week and this

843
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,200
is all free by the way totally free the

844
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:32,000
product is the content I mean like this

845
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,850
is this is what's there's nothing for

846
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,529
sales just completely free definitely

847
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,330
not your average studio stuff enjoy the

848
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:39,950
extreme beauty and talent of this ten

849
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,809
year old star right and so then there's

850
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,389
some some links there and so on you can

851
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:48,200
click on okay so what do we do we

852
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:49,758
stepped in and we harvest it publicly

853
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,379
posted and manifest which are really

854
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,960
kind of I don't know some cross between

855
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:55,039
a dot onion and a dot torrent file or

856
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,529
just a torrent file like I should say

857
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,820
and we gathered these from forums that

858
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,710
were dedicated to child sexual

859
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,809
exploitation law enforcement confirmed

860
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:05,059
to us that the manifests which had

861
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:07,070
overlapping I mean you know at Orion is

862
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:08,720
sort of a collection of files so there

863
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,149
was overlap in the content among these

864
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,220
manifests but you know to give the

865
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:16,250
tortoise the analogy thirty one thousand

866
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,960
known images of child pornography images

867
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,340
and video nine thousand of the thirty

868
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,470
one thousand where of infants and

869
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,590
toddlers Freenet because it's different

870
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,539
than tor actually enables you to without

871
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,980
breaking its anonymity know what people

872
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:29,450
are requesting like it doesn't try to

873
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,100
protect that it's just trying to protect

874
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,919
who requested it not what they're

875
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,509
requesting so we looked and it's thirty

876
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,789
five percent of the free no traffic was

877
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,289
for just these manifests with the known

878
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:42,129
images of child pornography never mind

879
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:45,169
what we didn't know about that's a lot

880
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:47,209
okay so what did we do well law

881
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:49,100
enforcement and observe this trading on

882
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,960
free nough we carefully deployed or

883
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,330
developed and deployed a forensic Lee

884
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,669
sound method we did this well with in

885
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:59,000
case law for in Fourth Amendment law

886
00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:00,529
there's a lot to know here we did it

887
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,110
with a quantifiable error rate which by

888
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:04,460
the way was near is near zero we worked

889
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,769
with law enforcement to train them

890
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,389
develop training programs we published

891
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,889
our approach and appear reviewed venue I

892
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:14,449
apologize it's not on the slide it was

893
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:16,310
on the previous one and then there were

894
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,990
arrests made and then I went to court

895
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,370
and defended it it was upheld twice two

896
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,400
independent judges two separate courts

897
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,219
two separate circuits federal this was

898
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,670
one of the cases that I was involved in

899
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,460
this guy this guy travelled the world in

900
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,140
order to teach Java and he went all over

901
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,540
the world one of the places he went was

902
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,500
the Philippines where he had sex with a

903
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,899
number of young girls a couple of them

904
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,250
were 12 years old he took pictures of it

905
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,420
as camera I brought it back to the

906
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,020
United States the camera and the

907
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,550
pictures were found in his home he is in

908
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:54,020
jail for 25 years okay so what's Freenet

909
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,940
stance on this well as I said before

910
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,830
there are a nice P they clearly can't do

911
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,830
anything how people this is from their

912
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,480
website how the question is I don't want

913
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,949
my node to be used to harbor child

914
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,850
pornography offensive content or

915
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,130
terrorism what can I do

916
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,959
well how people you choose to use the

917
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,760
tools their sole responsibility as a

918
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,620
communication medium Freenet cannot be

919
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,110
considered responsible for what people

920
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,340
use it for just like ISPs telecoms or

921
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,000
postal services cannot be held

922
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,439
responsible for their users either okay

923
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,870
and so I want to say at this point like

924
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,390
I get it I totally get it right I live

925
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:28,040
in this world to Facebook everyone

926
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,420
Google every major tech company

927
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,520
especially the large ones are under

928
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,170
pressure because they're doing bad

929
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,360
things to our privacy the New York Times

930
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,490
has a wonderful privacy project where

931
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,260
they talk about for example you know if

932
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,700
you're someone who can be discriminated

933
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,580
against for a variety of reasons maybe

934
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,260
you're part of the LGBTQ community you

935
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,879
need certain protections they read

936
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,560
privacy policies they were example I

937
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,390
completely agree it just so happens that

938
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,780
part of the problem is we have no

939
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,800
federal privacy law of any meaningful

940
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,170
design right like I mean that would

941
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,700
really solve a lot here I think it's

942
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,530
also ironic by the way that the New York

943
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,560
Times and putting up you know their

944
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:06,350
website I went to built with calm these

945
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:09,080
are the 66 separate organizations that

946
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,310
the New York Times wants to know wants

947
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,960
to let know that you're on they're

948
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,820
reading you know the New York Times and

949
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,190
so on I mean this is like a complete

950
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,330
disaster right so we need this

951
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,190
protection there's lots of other things

952
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,590
that go on and you know this is a well

953
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,660
funded community Mozilla NSF DARPA

954
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:27,860
Department of State we all know tor

955
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:29,360
originated with wasn't the name

956
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,490
right I mean you know so this is a

957
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,870
well-funded community but you know at

958
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,340
the same time and let's start to get

959
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,899
into the dilemma here and I don't have a

960
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:41,449
fix but let's look at the ACM code of

961
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:43,250
ethics as members of the ACM as

962
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,929
professionals we're obligated to undo or

963
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,269
mitigate the negative consequences as

964
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,740
much as possible one way to avoid

965
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,360
unintentional harm is to carefully

966
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,649
consider potential impacts of all those

967
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,870
affected and decisions made during

968
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:56,239
design and implementation I Triple E

969
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,489
similarly has similar ethics disclosure

970
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,080
or all sorts of things okay now let's

971
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,149
look at what other communities have had

972
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,120
when they faced dilemmas like this this

973
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:07,100
is a slide from the machine learning

974
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,239
community who are just you know outraged

975
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,830
that staples the company they on their

976
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,489
website priced things differently

977
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:19,219
someone was charged 1579 for stapler but

978
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,479
just a few miles away was 1429 I'm gonna

979
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,009
making light of this a little bit the

980
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,449
deeper issue here of course is it's a

981
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,679
very interesting topic of machine

982
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,629
learning how it can actually learn

983
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,609
unintentionally the bias that's

984
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:31,219
historically happened there's a really

985
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:32,389
great article about how well it's not

986
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,859
let's not get into tangents and I'm not

987
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,290
planning to okay and so they're outraged

988
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:37,429
by these staples and and obviously much

989
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,779
more deeper things involving

990
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,810
discrimination and so on and what did

991
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,159
the m/l community do they they got

992
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,299
together and said you know what it's

993
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,190
really important that fairness

994
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,990
accountability and transparency be

995
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,060
involved in machine learning let's get

996
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,609
together and solve this problem Bitcoin

997
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,429
is another disaster I work in this field

998
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,680
full disclosure you know we've all seen

999
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,550
reports a Bitcoin uses more energy than

1000
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,640
Ireland

1001
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:04,010
I think then Denmark in fact takes more

1002
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,299
energy than mining gold lots of opinions

1003
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,400
about how it's a huge waste of energy

1004
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,050
just so happens though it's a lot easier

1005
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,060
to solve things in Bitcoin you can just

1006
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:14,690
switch to proof of stake right doesn't

1007
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,859
it's just proof of stake is I don't

1008
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,210
think this is fair to say about let's

1009
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:18,890
just say it's applying known concepts

1010
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,570
from distributed computing to get rid of

1011
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,879
the whole proof of work concept and save

1012
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,099
a lot of energy it's an easier road here

1013
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,170
right like if you're in ml you're in

1014
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,270
Bitcoin the trolley problem is a lot

1015
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,400
easier you see bad things are coming and

1016
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,470
you just gotta switch tracks right it

1017
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,270
takes a lot of effort a lot of things a

1018
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,250
lot of problems come from that but it's

1019
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,560
an easier problem to solve it may be

1020
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,030
harder to make those solutions we have a

1021
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,390
much more difficult problem in what I'm

1022
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,250
here to

1023
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,710
to you about today right like darknets

1024
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,450
are wrestling with a lot of issues it's

1025
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,920
it's a zero-sum game you're gonna hurt

1026
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,149
one community or the other because

1027
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,579
there's a lot of people that need this

1028
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,440
protection and I would submit to you

1029
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:56,000
that like I don't really have a correct

1030
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,880
answer but we can start to analyze the

1031
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,740
case here so some of the analysis I

1032
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,829
think we should do is I my personal

1033
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,180
belief is that if some technologies

1034
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:06,799
those technologies should not be pursued

1035
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,359
if the societal costs outweigh the

1036
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:10,309
benefits and we can ask in pursuit of

1037
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,259
greater privacy are we sufficiently

1038
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,119
considering the cost to society and are

1039
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,559
we overestimating the benefits of these

1040
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,299
technologies and not considering

1041
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,069
alternatives and answering these

1042
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:20,509
questions we can really start to answer

1043
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:22,009
that this is the video that I put up at

1044
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,450
the top I I don't have time to play the

1045
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,069
whole thing but I encourage you to

1046
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,038
google phoenix 11 this is a group of

1047
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:29,329
victims who have bound found themselves

1048
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,039
and made a video and are trying to

1049
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:33,289
advocate for themselves to get out from

1050
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:38,599
under this right and so there's a real

1051
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:41,269
cost here that we have to consider now

1052
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,490
let's let's go into question two here

1053
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:44,660
what are the benefits well so just in

1054
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,419
case you don't know and you're randomly

1055
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,828
au snicks you know what's the point of

1056
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,390
this what's the point of onion services

1057
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:51,920
for example well so normally bob would

1058
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,509
go to the new york times and in doing so

1059
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,980
he would reveal his IP address and

1060
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:56,900
that's how most of the world operates

1061
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,339
but some people would rather have some

1062
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,539
privacy here right so they're gonna or

1063
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:00,710
at least anonymity and the way they're

1064
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:02,690
gonna do that is they're gonna use the

1065
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,509
tor browser which again is a separate

1066
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,789
item and by using the tor browser and

1067
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:09,980
i'm really if you know how tor works

1068
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:11,690
these little too blue gears that I made

1069
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,400
and some colored lines really don't do

1070
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,430
it justice but the idea is that you're

1071
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,140
going through very well Multi proxy

1072
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,058
system out to the New York Times site

1073
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,920
and they don't know your your IP address

1074
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,930
now that's very distinct from the onion

1075
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,759
services product and the goal of that is

1076
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,848
to not reveal the IP address of the

1077
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:30,859
website itself and from within tor you

1078
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,619
can contact the website and everyone's

1079
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:35,450
anonymous and that's great okay so when

1080
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:38,990
do you need to set up a your own server

1081
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:40,759
using onion services the answer might be

1082
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,019
that you're a newspaper your Facebook

1083
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,890
and you would like people to be able to

1084
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:45,799
contact you

1085
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:48,049
no that's not true right like you can

1086
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:50,599
you can put New York Times in face book

1087
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:53,240
out there on the web and have people use

1088
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,019
tor browser to contact you it's not

1089
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,799
necessary

1090
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:56,450
there's

1091
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,550
formitz reasons you might want to be an

1092
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,589
onion site or a hidden service but it's

1093
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:03,200
not necessary and so secure drop is not

1094
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,730
to me a good example of why onion

1095
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,950
services are helpful because you could

1096
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,120
provide it without them it's slightly

1097
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,319
different but you can provide it do you

1098
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,210
need it if you want to be involved in

1099
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,050
hate speech no turns out you can

1100
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,880
anonymously

1101
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,920
contribute to the hate speech community

1102
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,020
there's plenty of them out there you can

1103
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,390
use tor browser to do that ok so here's

1104
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,470
another obvious example what if you're

1105
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,029
involved in things that are illegal

1106
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,230
perhaps you're involved in illegal drugs

1107
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,760
or maybe you've stolen some of the

1108
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,020
credit cards of people who've paid their

1109
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,370
way to get inside this conference

1110
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,570
maybe you've stolen their PayPal

1111
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,549
accounts or you've hacked into their

1112
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,380
systems maybe you're selling malware to

1113
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,580
invade their privacy maybe you're

1114
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,890
involved in human trafficking including

1115
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,480
child sexual exploitation well that's a

1116
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,830
good reason to hide your IP address ok

1117
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,330
and so don't take my word for it there's

1118
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,759
several studies for this here's a great

1119
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,560
one there's a reference there to the DOI

1120
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,090
in the bottom some of the things that

1121
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,430
are said in the scientific article the

1122
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:52,100
most common uses for websites tor hidden

1123
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:56,690
services on tor hidden services are

1124
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,069
criminal money-laundering yeah I was

1125
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,390
going to say surely Bitcoin base there

1126
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,640
you go Bitcoin base money laundering

1127
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:04,460
stolen accounts variety of drugs illegal

1128
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,230
and so on websites dedicated to

1129
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,730
providing videos purporting to depict

1130
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,230
because they weren't allowed to go but I

1131
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,820
can tell you this is true purporting to

1132
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,700
depict rape bestiality and pedophilia

1133
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,220
were abundant including other problems

1134
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,750
ok so they say legitimate sites almost

1135
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,939
always choose to identify their

1136
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,010
operations legitimate hidden service

1137
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,260
sites while illicit hidden services

1138
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,850
almost always choose not to do so they

1139
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,710
have this interesting conclusion here

1140
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,819
even I'll say this again later even if

1141
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,860
you don't agree with anything I'm

1142
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,960
talking about this is what you have to

1143
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,490
think about to save tor and certainly to

1144
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,040
save towards reputation it may be

1145
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,020
necessary to kill hidden services not

1146
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,880
tor browser to kill hidden services at

1147
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,340
least in their present form ok this

1148
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,500
isn't a an Achilles heel of the Tor

1149
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,250
project which I'm not a part of so it's

1150
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,720
just my opinion

1151
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,560
here's a separate article which got a

1152
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,970
lot of press you may have seen it let's

1153
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,310
see take out the automated malware

1154
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:58,189
traffic in 83% of the visits to tor

1155
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:01,460
hidden service websites are child abuse

1156
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,840
child sexual abuse material he says

1157
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,070
before we did the study it was certainly

1158
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,840
in my view that dark net was a good

1159
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,330
thing okay and so the the Tor project

1160
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,740
responded in a couple different places

1161
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,569
saying that we'll wait a minute this is

1162
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,549
totally your you can't don't be careful

1163
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:16,520
not to misquote this you know over 80%

1164
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,770
but only 2% of the total traffic is part

1165
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,100
of Tours anonymizing network which to me

1166
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:24,020
is like really so more than 98% or let's

1167
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,730
say 98 percent of the total traffic is

1168
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,580
for tor browser but you want to support

1169
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,410
this other thing that is unsupportable

1170
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,730
so but then you know there's other uses

1171
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,670
for this and we have to consider the

1172
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,020
balance here well let's consider well

1173
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,400
let's come back to that so actually you

1174
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,840
know what if you're this guy okay so

1175
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,790
here's a real thing I mean that's like a

1176
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,400
scientific article but allow me to make

1177
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,790
this more real so maybe you heard of the

1178
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,410
playpen site the playpen site had

1179
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:51,110
150,000 registered and active users that

1180
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:53,089
logged into it to trade and form an

1181
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,760
offender community based on child sexual

1182
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:57,230
exploitation are you part of a community

1183
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,450
that has a hundred and fifty thousand

1184
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,100
users in it that's a big community

1185
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,359
that's a very large offending community

1186
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,040
that's teaching themselves how to do

1187
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,510
things I'm not even sure there's that

1188
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,210
many people in computer science in

1189
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:11,770
America like that's just tremendous okay

1190
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:14,900
and so this was a multiplying factor

1191
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:18,410
this guy is what where is it 30 years in

1192
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,410
prison outstanding individual this is

1193
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:24,710
what happened to playpen 25 US producers

1194
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:27,049
of child pornography were prosecuted 51

1195
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,970
of hands on offenders contact offenders

1196
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,620
is what I called them earlier 55

1197
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,419
children were successfully identified

1198
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:36,230
and rescued right like because of this

1199
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:37,880
operation 55 children stop having at

1200
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,680
least that part of the abuse end right

1201
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,810
but are in first sort of unfortunately a

1202
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,279
life of pain 296 children

1203
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,490
internationally rescued due to this

1204
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,260
effort 296 children there aren't 296

1205
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,919
children and people in this room right

1206
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:55,220
now 350 US arrests 548 international

1207
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,810
arrests of course it's not just about

1208
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,549
this crime right there's lots of things

1209
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,220
you can do here there's Silk Road

1210
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,930
there's all sorts of dark markets that

1211
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,089
are selling malware and krystal and

1212
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:07,520
credit cards to invade your privacy

1213
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:09,920
alpha bay is the latest one this was

1214
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,660
taken down fairly recently just an

1215
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,060
enormous I mean two hundred thousand

1216
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,460
users lots of Bitcoin other

1217
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,940
cryptocurrency stuff fentanyl all sorts

1218
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,890
of problems okay so what do I you know

1219
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,930
here's one of my suggestions

1220
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,299
if you're a reviewer for a paper or a

1221
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,850
grant demand a justification if you look

1222
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,190
at the the call for papers for PO pets

1223
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,049
it tells you the papers you're analyzing

1224
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,160
or this is the author's so the papers

1225
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,650
you're submitting should follow the

1226
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,790
basic principles of ethical research

1227
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,160
maximize benefits to an individual or

1228
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,540
society while minimizing harm I don't

1229
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,250
want I'm definitely not here to point

1230
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,920
names but I want to tell you I sat down

1231
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,690
and look through papers in not to just

1232
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,940
this conference but many conferences the

1233
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,980
top tier places in this community and I

1234
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,790
really find it hard to find papers that

1235
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:57,140
justify their work on dark nuts with

1236
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,970
anything other than this helps

1237
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,080
dissidents and journalists like how

1238
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,270
about a couple sentences that

1239
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,220
acknowledge that there's some harms to

1240
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,770
children and there's crime and darknets

1241
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,750
on this type of network just admit it

1242
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,370
give a balanced view I'm not saying the

1243
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,050
research should be done but don't put

1244
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:16,310
your head in the sand and if you're a

1245
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:18,140
reviewer you need to demand that okay so

1246
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,170
where are we sorry I'm getting getting

1247
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,000
upset so market selling malware but you

1248
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,760
know people invading your privacy not to

1249
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,200
mention victims of child abuse here's

1250
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,210
the know one of the main points I want

1251
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,850
to make all of this is outside the

1252
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,550
public view it's outside the ability of

1253
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:36,470
our community to engage in filtering

1254
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,300
like think about what I said about hm

1255
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,339
right maybe you believe in whatever

1256
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,110
they're saying on that site right but at

1257
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,150
least someone got to say I don't believe

1258
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,430
in a CloudFlare got to say we don't want

1259
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,910
to support that anymore right that's not

1260
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:51,649
happening here so also if it's you know

1261
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,799
it's allowing this immersive subculture

1262
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,960
and you know the thing about this is

1263
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,270
another point I want to make is it's not

1264
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,650
even that great right like people are

1265
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,110
getting arrested for this it's not

1266
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,900
impenetrable it's not such a great tool

1267
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:07,190
and I want to say like I've five minutes

1268
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,130
okay so I've looked through the tour

1269
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:12,800
website the Tor project website I find

1270
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,980
these limitations to be absent from the

1271
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,330
website it's not available to the users

1272
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,860
okay and so you might say wait a minute

1273
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,390
there's a whole bunch of good uses here

1274
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,270
so if you're gonna ask me that I want

1275
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,740
you to distinguish very carefully what

1276
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,810
can be done with normal hosting to

1277
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,910
protect people what can be accomplished

1278
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,310
by a VPN and what can be accomplished to

1279
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,839
a tor browser and leave for me a

1280
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,670
something that can only

1281
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:36,349
be done with onion services because if

1282
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,049
you're using onion services to do it

1283
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:40,519
you're creating the trolley problem

1284
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:42,019
right you got it the way you solve the

1285
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,649
Charlie problem is to not be on that

1286
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:44,569
track

1287
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,400
all right solve it another way think

1288
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:48,650
outside the box do something different

1289
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,569
and you know who or people say from

1290
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,099
right so let's agree upon it you know

1291
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:53,420
how do you judge something - security is

1292
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:55,309
one of the first things I tell students

1293
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,989
in my classes what's your definition of

1294
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:58,519
security well something secure this is

1295
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:00,289
just one definition but something secure

1296
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:02,359
if it cost the attacker more money to

1297
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:04,279
obtain than what they're tacking is

1298
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,200
worth or the attacker doesn't have you

1299
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:07,729
know those resources so who are they

1300
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,919
trying to protect journalists

1301
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:12,229
journalists are the target and some

1302
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,869
national security organization of some

1303
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:17,029
government is the adversary what

1304
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:19,549
resources do government's have to

1305
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:22,190
protect their existence all of their

1306
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:24,650
resources all of their resources what

1307
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:28,190
country cannot defeat tort what small

1308
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:29,690
business cannot defeat or like why is it

1309
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,549
that you think they won't just block the

1310
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,410
website blocked or or arrest you like

1311
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:35,599
what tactics won't they take to protect

1312
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,879
their existence from something they view

1313
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,029
as an existential threat I don't think

1314
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,460
it's sufficient and here's like the

1315
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:45,170
webpage like go ahead it ensures your

1316
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,969
privacy and safety don't worry about it

1317
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:50,210
I mean there's no notion of a limitation

1318
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:51,440
here I really don't think even some

1319
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,910
people at this conference could really

1320
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,410
tell you about the limitations of tor

1321
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,879
very well I don't think a journalist

1322
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:59,089
could do it either I don't think this is

1323
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,489
fair to the user base to do this and I

1324
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,749
you know obvious here is it's not that

1325
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:04,819
they're negligent in any way whatsoever

1326
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:06,288
there's many academic papers per year

1327
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:08,930
that describe attacks against the Tor

1328
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:10,369
project very responsibly they fix those

1329
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,919
flaws I mean why wouldn't they were very

1330
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:14,239
good people but of course other flaws

1331
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,380
are left in place because they have a

1332
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,089
problem that they need to balance

1333
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,200
performance right and until they're

1334
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:20,509
willing to give up performance

1335
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,879
completely then they can't solve this

1336
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:24,380
problem so what are we left with if

1337
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,059
you're a person who wants to use tor to

1338
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,670
go up against criminal law enforcement I

1339
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:29,809
mean it's not that good protection

1340
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,700
admittedly it takes some effort but it's

1341
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:34,160
clearly not impossible like there's

1342
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,839
public takedowns and if you want to be a

1343
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,430
journalist or a dissident go against

1344
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,440
national security you're being given a

1345
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:41,569
water pistol to enter into a war with

1346
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,269
people who have bullets like I just

1347
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:46,550
don't think that's safe ok so there's

1348
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:49,399
you know there's lots of ways

1349
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,839
this is from the tour website I I want

1350
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,300
to say I have no understanding of this

1351
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:56,060
first quote I've been to conferences

1352
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,470
where people who work with victims I'd

1353
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,920
ask them directly like what does this

1354
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,209
mean

1355
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,710
because some people and survivors

1356
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,240
communities embrace stigma instead of

1357
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,770
compassion seeking support from fellow

1358
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,080
victims requires privacy preserving

1359
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,880
technology I really I have no idea what

1360
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,080
this is about it's not true as far as I

1361
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,540
can say I'd love to know what it's about

1362
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,980
I'm probably just totally mistaken our

1363
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,109
refusal to build backdoors and

1364
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,670
censorship into tourists not good notice

1365
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:20,060
I've not suggested anyone put a backdoor

1366
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:21,650
in not suggesting that ok criminals

1367
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,930
would still have access to other methods

1368
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:26,660
yes they would but they would find it a

1369
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,490
lot harder to form a community to groom

1370
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,259
each other rather to train each other

1371
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,509
right to tell each other how to avoid

1372
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,030
detection there's no opportunity for

1373
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:36,980
anyone to who's outside this community

1374
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,150
to not support it I mean that's the

1375
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,800
problem it's not that they wouldn't have

1376
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,420
some other way to commit a crime they

1377
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,640
would find it hard to community without

1378
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,990
tor and I want it again if you if you

1379
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,170
don't believe anything I'm saying this

1380
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:50,419
is among my last slides here like this

1381
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,160
is why CloudFlare stop supporting hñ

1382
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,520
because that community ignored warnings

1383
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,589
and tolerated crime tolerated violence

1384
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,440
against people and avoided moderating

1385
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:01,849
the platform right I mean that's it's an

1386
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,190
existential threat to the Tor project

1387
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:07,700
for less than two percent of the traffic

1388
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:10,520
right ok so what's my summary two slides

1389
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,109
left what's you know remember long ago

1390
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,430
we've heard another part of the talk we

1391
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:15,200
were talking about crimes against

1392
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,299
children so Internet crimes against

1393
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,618
children is a massive global problem the

1394
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,750
incidents are overwhelming the

1395
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:23,530
investigators who do just incredible

1396
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,270
work you know really giving up their own

1397
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,560
themselves into this are totally

1398
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,509
underfunded I didn't really prove that

1399
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,490
but it's true offenders are based in

1400
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:34,580
organized communities victims are just

1401
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:36,109
as young as you can possibly imagine law

1402
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,790
enforcement are doing a really hard job

1403
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:39,890
but you know if you want to get into

1404
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,810
this you can do some great reliable

1405
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,430
forensically sound methods to give to

1406
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,529
law enforcement to help them rescue a

1407
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,029
child and we need to make this part of

1408
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:49,130
the conversation of this community I

1409
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,890
don't know why I'm the only one I'm one

1410
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,270
of the only people who talked about this

1411
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,490
and some technology makes it hard for

1412
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,140
society to make informed decisions on

1413
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,279
behalf of the children being abused ok

1414
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,879
so what do I want this is the last slide

1415
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,380
here my suggestion

1416
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,350
and really I'm nobody right but you can

1417
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,850
just take this for discussion so first I

1418
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:07,560
want to you know make sure you

1419
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:10,020
understand I want there to be research

1420
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,520
that is there to protect the most

1421
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,390
vulnerable people in our society that's

1422
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,850
not just children

1423
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,470
to me that's dissidents journalists

1424
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,600
people are discriminated for any number

1425
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:21,029
of reasons their ethnicity religion

1426
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,680
sexuality you name it gender whatever it

1427
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,780
is I I fully believe that that's you

1428
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,730
know was a Gandhi who said you know we

1429
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,490
jut we measure society by its ability to

1430
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,860
protect its weakest I personally feel

1431
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:33,779
the Tor project must clearly quantify in

1432
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,340
dollars perhaps on its website the

1433
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,290
minimal resources required by an

1434
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,240
adversary to defeat the software ahead

1435
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,580
of download and I think that you know

1436
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,129
you can admit you how about some

1437
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,390
transparency that or just education

1438
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,280
let's call it that it can't hide that

1439
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,870
you're using that I think personally

1440
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,360
it's time as a community to stop

1441
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,980
labeling onion services as a technology

1442
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,200
that is on balance of course it's

1443
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:59,400
helpful but on balance helpful right

1444
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:02,009
personally if you design a system that

1445
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,860
you know I I get it right like I I go

1446
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:07,440
home it's a joy to me to design new cute

1447
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,480
things and distributed systems but if

1448
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,370
you can design a system without onion

1449
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,050
services like for example secure drop if

1450
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,850
you could do that without onion services

1451
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,620
then you're obligated to do so because

1452
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:18,330
you're obligated to avoid the trolley

1453
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,799
problem I want to also say that if

1454
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:22,049
you're encouraging people to use onion

1455
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,220
services needlessly you're not you're

1456
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,840
not hurting I guess but you're not

1457
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,459
helping like the scale of people that

1458
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,080
use onion services doesn't mitigate the

1459
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,050
harm to victims so that does nothing to

1460
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,660
do with it if you're a reviewer I think

1461
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:36,930
you need to start asking authors of

1462
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:38,310
darknet research if on you know like do

1463
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,109
that are they presenting some argument

1464
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,490
about why on balance it's a beneficial

1465
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,560
solution or at least to declare the

1466
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:45,240
harms that are involved and personally I

1467
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,520
feel that the sites that run onion

1468
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,620
services because they cause right now on

1469
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,750
a daily basis enormous and continual

1470
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,730
harm to victims of sexual abuse and all

1471
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,990
of you right because you're the victims

1472
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,660
of other privacy crimes from these

1473
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,669
marketplaces and so on I think you know

1474
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,040
it's end it's an existential threat to

1475
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,660
the projects I mean you're just you're

1476
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,270
one op-ed away from losing all your

1477
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,790
funding it's time to move on okay find

1478
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:11,610
some other find some other project halt

1479
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,170
onion services and find a different

1480
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,800
solution for supporting free speech

1481
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,180
there's

1482
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,720
lots of other solutions out there this

1483
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:20,430
is you know a project from 2004 that I

1484
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,660
believe on balance is really not helping

1485
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:25,620
okay so that's the end of my rant and I

1486
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,370
don't know how much time there is but

1487
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,370
I'd be happy to take some questions

1488
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:40,530
okay we'll take one question not going

1489
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,089
anywhere

1490
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,840
all right I'll cede my time to Roger if

1491
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:47,670
he has a question if you only have one

1492
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,050
yeah so this is a bunch of interesting

1493
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,630
stuff to talk about I'd love to chat

1494
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,280
more about it three thoughts in the 30

1495
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,380
seconds that we've got the first thought

1496
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,690
is these people that you're talking

1497
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,040
about are terrible people and I wish

1498
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,320
they would stop doing the things they're

1499
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,690
doing so I think we we totally have

1500
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:06,120
common ground on that one the second

1501
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:09,000
thought is a lot of the ways that Tor

1502
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,980
fails to protect people are not at the

1503
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,590
level of Tor but they're at the OPSEC

1504
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,270
level or a bunch of other there's so

1505
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:17,670
many layers that you have to get right

1506
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,950
if you want to be safe in the world on

1507
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,900
the internet and tor is only one of them

1508
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,620
so I don't want to say that tor is

1509
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:27,420
perfect it's totally not but in each of

1510
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,190
these scenarios that you're talking

1511
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,960
about and in a lot of other scenarios

1512
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,270
for actual activists and journalists and

1513
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,210
so on the thing that goes wrong is it a

1514
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:39,650
different layer than tor and then the

1515
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:44,130
third thing to talk about there are so

1516
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:47,310
we made a mistake early on in letting

1517
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:49,440
people frame onion services as I want to

1518
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,810
set up a website and I want to put

1519
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,330
content on it that the man's gonna hate

1520
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:58,170
so I've been thinking a lot more about

1521
00:52:54,330 --> 00:53:00,180
this as a transport layer a metadata

1522
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,760
secure transport layer so you've got

1523
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:04,350
HTTP you've got HTTPS but it has the

1524
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,860
certificate authority problems and so on

1525
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:09,720
and you've got onion services as a

1526
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,600
metadata resistant transport mechanism

1527
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,959
so for example there are people using

1528
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,750
onion services as instant messaging

1529
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:21,450
where there's no middle in the I chat or

1530
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:23,820
XMPP or jabber or signal or all of those

1531
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:25,649
they all have a center where they know

1532
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,790
who you are they know where you are they

1533
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:30,090
know when you're talking and who your

1534
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:32,070
friends are and that is a really

1535
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:35,910
dangerous model that everybody is using

1536
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:39,570
and a metadata resistant communications

1537
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:41,609
platform which which requires people to

1538
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:44,460
not need to know where the people

1539
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,570
they're talking to are is something that

1540
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,880
I think is really important for the

1541
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,990
world but we're not there yet so I

1542
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,810
totally

1543
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:53,549
except your man these people are talking

1544
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,529
about just you know stop regulating me

1545
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,359
just let me finish my technology side I

1546
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:59,670
think there's a there's a lot of stuff

1547
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:02,580
to talk about here and and I'll stop

1548
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,589
talking now and let somebody else go or

1549
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:07,410
maybe we'll all go up to you afterwards

1550
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:09,900
and talk okay all right well thanks for

1551
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:12,009
attending I appreciate your you being

1552
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:17,499
here

1553
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:17,499
[Applause]
