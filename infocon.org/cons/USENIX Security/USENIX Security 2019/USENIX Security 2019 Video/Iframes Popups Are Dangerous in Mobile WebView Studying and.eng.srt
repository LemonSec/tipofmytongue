1
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:15,110
ok thanks for the induction and is it

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,320
rotation of the legs we share our reason

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,538
to research about

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,900
pretty of Aafrin pop appropriate

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,330
behaviors so you enjoy the lobby you in

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,209
modern web applications a frame pop up

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,909
frequently used here is the snapshots

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,448
all for seeing a flames

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,809
I used the true loot and trusted content

10
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:38,790
attachment here in the past years

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,949
Tyrael auto security issues are found in

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,280
after him pop ups and the security of

13
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:46,440
the behaviors have been well started but

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,829
a city worker mainly focus on regular

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,170
reporter and research secretary search a

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,590
new webview elements called enjoy the

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,170
webview is still missing so what is why

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,520
bu and the white secretary search on web

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,160
you is so important

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,700
Bobby reads embedded browser like you

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,920
are company's web you can be easily

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,990
integrated anymore perhaps to show our

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,640
pages and run JavaScript code butter

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,369
which also leaving these applications

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,390
and we your recall this application as a

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,360
habit apps web you is very easy to use

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,979
and however and the popular so if it

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,320
here it's an e security issue found in

29
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,810
what view it's a security issue may have

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,039
the series as security impacts our

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,350
mobile apps motivation we found sellable

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,360
you provided cellular única features and

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,479
it is feature the heavily embarrasses of

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,759
Harriers of offering pop-ups so there is

35
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,310
a security question is raised Ephraim

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,220
pop-ups us to see if we enjoy this new

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,259
web development motivated by this

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,490
research question we conducted their

39
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,460
first US equity

40
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,310
study on the security of Ephraim Papa

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,229
behaviors II enjoy w as a result we

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,790
found several critical and fundamental

43
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,439
design flows and one paydays we call

44
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,840
this one bait hits the difference of

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,470
intestine one Beatty's the ODC we for

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,790
short lectures we recites that security

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,680
is part of the series only word apps for

48
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,320
this purpose he also did sang with Noah

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,620
on a BT detection shoe called T severe

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,840
hunter and we found that history has the

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,860
series decreasing is best only water

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,650
apps and though we also found

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,290
high-profile outside markets last oh we

54
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,360
also designed a NOAA defense solution

55
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,160
for our security study and the DC way

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,250
before without Chisolm we first define

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,980
our strata model we use this picture to

58
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,380
show the attackers will select the

59
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,988
party's mobile app and the right party

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,239
is a web server in which a mobile app

61
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,230
will start a web server contacted so

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,730
observe can talk to up you to connect to

63
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,730
entire web server and the show its web

64
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,440
content and inside the wahoo I've we

65
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,390
assumed some of our code a totally

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,790
benign but what you may contain some

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,040
untrusted the contents in particular we

68
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,760
assumed the mainframe or tall frame is

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,560
benign but I've limited her loads and

70
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,959
trusted Clinton's my castle party

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,510
tracking codes may be malicious

72
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,700
so the untrusted Efrain perhaps

73
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,579
immediately attack her any potential

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,959
objects records at home mmm frame and

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,880
web you itself or and even mobile code

76
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,190
and our security started mainly focus on

77
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,900
the inconsistencies between regular

78
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,220
browsers and web view this inconsistent

79
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,140
inconsistencies are caused by abuse

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,400
unique you are and the programming

81
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:53,100
features and so an extra attacker ideas

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,220
data and trusted Efrain perhaps may

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,350
leverage or trigger a singing

84
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,720
consistencies to carry some dangerous

85
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,040
and risky abilities we found that this

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,280
attack

87
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,870
idea is very faithful and possible in

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,950
practice so what are the incan secuence

89
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,260
consistency is between local browsers

90
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,420
and web view wise it causes so serious

91
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,620
every issues and there are mainly two

92
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,048
top offer inconsistent consensus the

93
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,970
first that happens about a UI design and

94
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:26,280
this picture shows a completion between

95
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,200
regular browser and a web view and we

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,510
can notice web view only provided

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,750
earlier for showing web content without

98
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,570
any address portable bar and that this

99
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,700
causes a serious equity issues the first

100
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,719
of security issues from the lack of for

101
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,159
a spark

102
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:49,349
so if we trusted a from pop-ups

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:51,270
consecrating navigators armor for him so

104
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,569
fishing attacker can be easily launched

105
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,609
and we found that this attacker is

106
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,939
possible in practice this is a totally

107
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,519
determined about the navigation policy

108
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:03,899
indeed this policy the latter law any

109
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,149
summer frame should you actually

110
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,369
navigate to the mainframe even the South

111
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,689
Rim has totally fluent or engines with

112
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:13,349
mainframe

113
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:16,169
why the the navigation policy is Italian

114
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:18,330
this way this indeed this navigation

115
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:20,490
policy designed for regular browser and

116
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,490
the web Beauty rattling high weights to

117
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,039
this navigation from regular browser

118
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,439
since the policy is not so harmful for

119
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,438
regular browser parts where we tenderest

120
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,419
of probably you so here is a given

121
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,419
example to show the security issue

122
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,998
see see this is a popular banking app

123
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,669
developers try to use the webview to

124
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:44,550
have her user to recite the password in

125
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:47,279
this website web page so the party

126
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,279
content is included you know a frame

127
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,800
this laflamme's can or has the

128
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,019
capability to level reaches of the

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,519
navigation policy to security navigates

130
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:01,349
samarium and the fishing cat may look an

131
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,449
answer second issue is from the lack of

132
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,639
would have a bar here is a very

133
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,879
important implementation principle

134
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,219
difference wobble window is undeterred

135
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,829
by different so up you you are so

136
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:17,819
attackers may launch you idly dressing

137
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:20,849
attack here is the process this is a

138
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,309
banana be you so untrusted after women

139
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:25,409
may cherry to a pop-up window and this

140
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:28,769
is a new window will be Linda did you

141
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:30,389
know different new web view and the

142
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:34,459
attacker need to find a witch

143
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,499
true or alive it's a new rival you

144
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:40,289
malicious wobble you to overlap foods or

145
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:41,849
benign what you we found this attacker

146
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,849
is also possible

147
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:47,308
we call this attacker as a reliable

148
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,949
attack this is because the many absent

149
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:53,519
manage the wintering order of multiple

150
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,189
what we used by themself so but this

151
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,110
capability is your initial redesign of

152
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,750
Alban ankle

153
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,740
there is a fundamental design flows

154
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,370
flows in what were you militia Mauricio

155
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,319
Dakota also got his capability and

156
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,110
another case a to sum up who me please

157
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,340
this newly created or ever you be handed

158
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:19,410
be now web you and it is view possible

159
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,049
for attacker to launch a phishing attack

160
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,599
the attacker just need to find a way to

161
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:29,280
closes a current p9w this is a

162
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,770
implemented by calling Java server if

163
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,169
you have windows closed and when this

164
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,930
API is a clue is called

165
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,240
what were you to correspond you maybe

166
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,909
you even even handler will also be

167
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,180
triggered and if it is even hundreds and

168
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:46,409
notes properly implemented attackers do

169
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,220
have the chance that you launch your

170
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:52,289
attack similar with the previous record

171
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,000
so corresponding you in the handle also

172
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:59,479
has a very fundamental design flaws so

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,030
it's harder for developer to distinguish

174
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:06,960
the operation is done by malicious code

175
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:10,638
or benign code so this is the first

176
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,888
oh here's I usually example to show its

177
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,380
security consequence and this is leading

178
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,599
the flight searching app and the app

179
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,690
developers try to use the web you to

180
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,780
show the flight take his information

181
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,060
provided by eight OCR and in this a web

182
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,909
page and trusted a flume is also

183
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,770
included so attackers can directly

184
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,929
launch wall app attack a chair with

185
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,380
pop-up and the user is a pop-up window

186
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:42,208
to or Lapid subpoena well above you

187
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:45,930
window so this is a first app or you can

188
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:48,930
see consistency about UI and its

189
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,060
security issues and the second tab it's

190
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,449
about the programming features and we

191
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,489
found a web view provides many

192
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:00,020
programming AP is and this API to allow

193
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,850
developers to do customization

194
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,339
forty-year owns web view instances and

195
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,190
the pad so we found that there is a

196
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,770
strong conflict between W or

197
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,940
customization and

198
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:18,800
well browsers so developers can leverage

199
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:22,190
this now this conflict to do navigation

200
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,000
attack so you can directly navigate as a

201
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,120
man frame and the difference between its

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,640
the attacker and the previous attack

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,800
previous navigation attack it's

204
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,680
erratically totally privileged or

205
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,280
exceeding defense solutions including

206
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:47,120
Ephraim sandbox limited to fluency is a

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:50,510
kind of attack so so indicates this qu

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,650
attacks addressing attack and navigation

209
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,630
attack

210
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,560
we found the attacker can also to

211
00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:01,090
malicious things but also hand

212
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,040
hidehiro in malicious all engines like

213
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,650
for example developer solid malicious

214
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,980
attackers immediately still sent

215
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,220
information or access since tentative

216
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:18,220
hardware like a camera but so it's also

217
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:21,770
any limitations we in our paper also

218
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,350
shows all exciting different solutions

219
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:29,020
are limited to province adhesive a basic

220
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,720
attacks and for the security assessments

221
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,550
for this purpose so it is an no war on

222
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,860
the PT detached and shoe called the

223
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,969
disable hunter this picture has shows

224
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,580
workflow firstly easily hunter child

225
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,820
should be constructed in can't answer

226
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:50,000
for each W instance and the later data

227
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,130
determining if untrusted aphromoo flume

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,780
Oh papa

229
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:58,730
it's include includes and if it was and

230
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,699
trusted at Ephraim Papa includes

231
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,610
attacker may has a attack surface to

232
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,290
launch 30 severe attacks last this way

233
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,310
hunter will try to determine the

234
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,380
exciting's all 40 severe Warren Beatty's

235
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,439
by will play in DC we hunter on a large

236
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,870
number of hybrid apps we found many

237
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:23,630
hybrid apps are potential warn about

238
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:26,420
almost 14% some Apatow

239
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:30,200
so but and the lectures that we also

240
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,209
check under well we fired this the

241
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,390
potential honorable Absa had have been

242
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:39,140
downloaded by more than 90 billion terms

243
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,780
and we also well refer our chooser had

244
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:45,140
so why we low for supportive and this

245
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:49,069
people has a cable moti tells about each

246
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:53,960
attack and if lumps its table we can

247
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:56,030
notice the navigation attacks almost the

248
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,970
impacts are all potential one of our

249
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,680
apps this is because the consequence of

250
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:05,690
a navigation attacker can be easily

251
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:11,270
satisfied and we also manually well we

252
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:13,340
find many popular apps many of some are

253
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,370
impacted like a facebook facebook

254
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,880
Messenger is Instagram Google News Skype

255
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,800
who you were and which hearts and our

256
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,200
many so the party library is also

257
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,150
invited like Facebook who react native

258
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,420
elaborately and the more interesting

259
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,970
things is we found the many leadings

260
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,819
password management app and the bank

261
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,860
banking app are also impacted so all

262
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,550
this indicates that ECB has a very

263
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:44,330
serious equity in sparse and the leaders

264
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,880
and then lastly we use another example

265
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,550
for case study this exam who is a face

266
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,610
book messenger different from previous

267
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:56,930
two examples this app who implemented

268
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,210
its own address bar this home address

269
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,670
park and somehow reduced the in

270
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,160
consequence consistence the botanical

271
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,370
poser and web view but we found that

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,949
this address bar has a lot of security

273
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,740
issues and in our papers that we give a

274
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,890
detailed explanation and here we only

275
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,440
focus a one problem and this is the

276
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,380
problem is related Shirley's condition

277
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,510
this is a picture to show the attackers

278
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,900
from you and the attacker ms in the

279
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,960
message to victory user when user click

280
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,540
this link a web you is started to show

281
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,390
the corresponding web content and the

282
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,160
theory is address part which shows your

283
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,610
arrows that are being loaded by

284
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,009
so what were you and hae bait or say I'm

285
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:47,449
here and if you attack her lunch table

286
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:49,699
you you are we just in attack Lacan says

287
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:53,479
firstly generates a pop-up and it is a

288
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:56,479
newly created web you will overlap with

289
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,149
older be known what we you are but so

290
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,899
transfer can reflect the change of for

291
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:05,000
web content so user may notice notice

292
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,670
eight another vision attacker may fail

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,360
but we found the develop attackers

294
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:14,120
recurrent Sidhu how some chances to

295
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,569
launches this phishing attack by

296
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,959
combining a couple taxa together

297
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:23,990
firstly attackers do chair which is a

298
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:28,699
palpable you you are and attacker

299
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,040
refresh the old webview you are in that

300
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:34,219
release the in background and in this

301
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,689
way the rest bar will show the benign

302
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,029
you are this is because it's new over

303
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:44,329
you are you are and older and the older

304
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:49,130
web we share the same address bar so you

305
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:52,069
saw just parentless shows us that is the

306
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:55,399
last access the party's web view so you

307
00:14:52,069 --> 00:15:00,199
was back around or above your access the

308
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,970
benign URL at a in the end so just a

309
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,550
part we would totally shows a benign you

310
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,680
are and here this is a picture that

311
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,920
shows the final results and we also gave

312
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,930
a modded more demos use about Herman Inc

313
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,469
and you can also find it is linking our

314
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:18,410
paper and we we have to report our

315
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,480
solution sorry all of Tony's that you

316
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,910
enjoyed and Facebook or security teams

317
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,329
and other app developers and many of

318
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,250
them has a confirm his findings and the

319
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:30,109
battery we found that it's really hard

320
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,860
for developers to fix this problem

321
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,259
because it is we are looted from the ye

322
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,209
can inconsistency between regular

323
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:41,180
browser and the web view it's not caused

324
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:44,149
by some programming mistakes so we

325
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,699
develop nor different solution under in

326
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:50,029
our evaluation we value our solution is

327
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:54,260
if I to come tableau and

328
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:56,240
cause only lower Heights so conclusion

329
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,510
Bob you had to attract more and more

330
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,209
attention and in past years as I said

331
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,819
the starting about Ephram perhaps have

332
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:07,699
been working in local reporter but their

333
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,550
behaviors are really understood in the

334
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,700
new lab environments of one view so our

335
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:16,849
paper has a filter cap this car we

336
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,880
discovered a new new class of one pages

337
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,370
and it's a new detection shoe and also

338
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,519
with a new different solution and we

339
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:31,550
also verify history has a serious equity

340
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:34,220
in spans and but if it was a researchers

341
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,310
and now down because as I can see

342
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,950
consistency between regular browser and

343
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,260
the web user may not only impacts a

344
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,050
flamenco proper behaviour but also

345
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,899
impacts others into viable behaviors so

346
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:52,250
we encourage the researchers to expose

347
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:56,089
more sensible behaviors and he harvested

348
00:16:52,250 --> 00:17:02,720
a web use activity okay thanks I'm ready

349
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:09,260
for our questions as usual use the

350
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:11,449
microphones hi my name is Bobo from

351
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,339
Facebook thanks for the talk I had a

352
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,250
question about the messenger case study

353
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,579
so I'm not sure I fully followed was the

354
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,230
URL that was sent to the victim user

355
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,698
legitimately that URL it wasn't like a

356
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,709
Unicode look-alike character that was

357
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:28,189
replaced in anything and then second

358
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,230
what was the mitigation uh so you just

359
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:32,809
admissions or case study about the face

360
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,429
of a facebook Messenger because Emily

361
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:37,820
mutation I quickly goes to lose these

362
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:40,970
things and and in our paper wiki was a

363
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,360
more details and for our medication and

364
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,540

365
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:54,159
limitation how quickly mentioned some

366
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:58,340
and there are all these solutions are

367
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,580
mentioned in our paper okay I'll look at

368
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,580
