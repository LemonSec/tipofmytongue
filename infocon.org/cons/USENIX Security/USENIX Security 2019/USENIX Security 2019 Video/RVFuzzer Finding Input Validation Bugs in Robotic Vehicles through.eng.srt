00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,900
hello everyone my name is telegin today

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,509
I'll talk about our reporter to discover

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,820
input validation validation input

4
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:24,869
validation box in robot APO kospi our

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,539
control Ida testing so first let me

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,369
introduce what is the logo tpo Co robot

7
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,099
EPO code is a type of a cyber-physical

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,530
system interacting with the physical

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:38,099
world there are various types of

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,309
vehicles such as aerial and ground

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,900
vehicles and they can be used in the

12
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,870
burials of purposes such as delivery

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,930
however robotic vehicles have many

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:55,559
security issues which can lead to

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:58,739
crashing into the crowd and put in or

16
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:03,540
protected in protected places and even

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,970
injuring people and the people we

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,600
discuss the security issues let me

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,420
introduce a howl over the vehicles works

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,509
there is a loaded vehicle system and it

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,300
consists of work keyboards such as

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,570
vision module to handle command sent

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,890
from the ground control station and the

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,550
sensor module to observe the physical

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,410
vehicles the physical state and

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:34,080
controller which is the heart of the

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,600
logo typical system to stabilize the

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,840
blueprint along the six degrees of

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:46,139
freedoms and then this this controls the

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,510
mechanical models and then these modules

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,350
generate a property versus based on the

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:55,110
control aerodynamic dynamics of our

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:58,020
vehicle and the physics and control

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,240
surely then they add they adjusted

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,640
proportional process according to the

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,789
observer the vehicle state in six

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,399
figures degrees of freedom then let's

38
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,750
determine the six degrees of freedoms

39
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,650
controller and how much they are complex

40
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,530
so there is a six degree of freedom and

41
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,180
that each degree is controlled by one

42
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:28,280
cascading controller as an example of

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,469
k accesses cassidy controller it inside

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,900
of the circus scaling controller there

45
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,450
are three castrated primitive contours

46
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,689
and then the operation over such

47
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,790
contours are determined by control

48
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:43,189
parameter parameters or controller

49
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,909
module vision module and the sensor

50
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:49,310
module and then there are there are

51
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:51,469
hundred or above control parameters or

52
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,870
doors modules and then they are

53
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:55,569
dynamically configurable by ground

54
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,099
control station

55
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:01,879
however this convenient the control

56
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:06,409
interface opens up dot new secret the

57
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,450
hall then let me introduce such a secret

58
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:12,168
the host for people I talked about by

59
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:16,849
our or new secret Hall let me summarize

60
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:19,969
the two existing secret the hosts were

61
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:23,089
still one is physical attacks such as a

62
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:26,659
census cutting edge of the example

63
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,780
during on normal flight epidural

64
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:33,048
attacker who generate a noise too busily

65
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,169
the sensor all over typical start to

66
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,579
serve physical disturbance at the end it

67
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:43,310
caused severe injuries fortunately this

68
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,699
can be mitigated by control based

69
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:49,760
detection or built on mechanism and then

70
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:54,699
the other one is software traditional

71
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:58,429
dr. box and then such as a palpable flow

72
00:03:54,699 --> 00:04:01,509
since the control program is also a type

73
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:06,079
of a program it inevitably has a

74
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:09,048
software box and each exploitation also

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,590
caused 6000 freedom controls tue-barbe

76
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:16,280
function we call this type of about as a

77
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,108
syntactic block and then personally this

78
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,469
is this can be also be related by

79
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,258
program watching and hardening and in

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,990
this work we introduced a new type of

81
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:30,199
odd semantic box instead of a syntactic

82
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,680
box we call this bog as a control

83
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,950
semantic box and then this is new and

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,110
has not what she has not disabled much

85
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,530
attention and then is not dependable

86
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:46,480
with the audible approaches so then

87
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,950
let's t go into control semantic box so

88
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,260
so this little is portable

89
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,170
by sending on balusters the parameter

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,980
change in command and then this is

91
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,350
possible because stitches to vehicle

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,730
communication such as bubbling is not

93
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:08,570
secure and then it causes and needs one

94
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,190
control to mark function and then we

95
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,580
believe that this is quite a meaningful

96
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:16,580
to even two attackers due to the power

97
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,940
in three regions first of all it is

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,770
remotely trickable by single militias

99
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,219
the control parameter change command

100
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,460
hence it leaves minimum footprint second

101
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,570
it does not lie on previous attend

102
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,049
mother the changes sends us cooking code

103
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,450
injection and the Trojan is fight

104
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,160
finally it is a lunchable even emptor

105
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,320
program is hardened against the

106
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,940
traditional his point then let's talk

107
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,000
about the nature of this system and

108
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,540
control somatic box so there is a

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,150
parameter P one and then on attacker

110
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,270
bait tried to manipulate this p1 value

111
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,780
with uh some invalid range that is

112
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,450
within the solid range however I usually

113
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,000
come to a control program usually have a

114
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,469
some defense mechanism to protect such

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,950
as a range the lead range values

116
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:21,140
therefore such trial usually prevented

117
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:23,810
buys built-in defense mechanism and then

118
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,200
as a result actually robotic vehicle

119
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,470
simply fly normally and then it is

120
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,380
similar is a signal to belittle value

121
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,690
setting so in this case if we set a

122
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,240
value within a green range which is the

123
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,469
tool belt value range it does not cause

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,020
any problem in physical operation

125
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:48,260
however upon attacker

126
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,359
bonnet manipulated this p1 value with

127
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,780
value within the

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,039
pink lanes then it all over the people

129
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:02,210
start to short physical disturbance and

130
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:04,878
the despite of this listen is it is it

131
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,729
passes through the built-in depends

132
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:13,250
because it is within the permitted range

133
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:15,590
so in this context our goal is that we

134
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,889
want to shrink that this permitted

135
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,698
implant into the true value range

136
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:25,099
denoted the edge of green range and then

137
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,219
also this is not only for single

138
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,770
parameter but also it must be done with

139
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:35,990
the other hundreds of all control

140
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:40,580
parameters also we have observed that

141
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,370
wind effect actually cause cause effect

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,550
the green range I mean the true value

143
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,150
range so in this case suppose there is a

144
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,419
parameter P and the it is that as a

145
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,419
denoted value and in this context

146
00:07:53,419 --> 00:08:00,258
without any wind it does not cause any

147
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:02,448
problem integral equation however if

148
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:06,379
there is a wind effect such as strong

149
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:08,419
wind it's invalid value will be expanded

150
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,930
and then true value range will be

151
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,729
shrunken so tell Paul we should we

152
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,900
should also consider disability effect

153
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:23,690
during the test so to find this is

154
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:26,690
control cemented box we we can posit our

155
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,089
control program and then however there

156
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,969
are two main challenges first one is how

157
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:36,940
to detect the pedal control program lon

158
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:41,719
and then it is true that program crash

159
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:44,920
can indicate a traditional program known

160
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:50,510
however this is not applicable to the

161
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:54,110
contrary control program lon this is

162
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:58,670
because a true indicator herbal control

163
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:02,560
a better control on is not program crash

164
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,920
actually it is apparent of instability

165
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,680
supportive example support or contra

166
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,740
program is exploited by let's say

167
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,430
control semantic box even if I saw our

168
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,210
control program will still keep we'll

169
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,550
keep longing without any program crash

170
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,410
in this context contour surely comes the

171
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,180
last you

172
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:28,240
so we consider concern in stability

173
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,069
control instability agile where the

174
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,020
contra program lon and then we there are

175
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,110
two types of abode don't train gentle

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,110
diverges that is considered as a control

177
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,720
instability first one is the divergence

178
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,290
between leper estate and the observer

179
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,779
the state level state indicates desired

180
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,270
pitch pro operation on the other hand

181
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:56,140
observer the state indicates our actual

182
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:59,079
physical operation it would be prepared

183
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,260
your large and percent divergence

184
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,589
between two state all over TP awkward

185
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,260
start to show severe control instability

186
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:11,470
as you can see in the peer and then the

187
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:16,360
other type is divergence between

188
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:18,400
reference state and mission and then we

189
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,800
put there is a large and percentage

190
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:26,010
divergence between two between two

191
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:32,459
states logo TP aku cannot track the

192
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:35,860
trajectory at trajectory therefore we

193
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:39,220
rebounded actually with the standard

194
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,710
control properties and the formula is it

195
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:46,209
possible that is possible to detect such

196
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:50,230
a don't train gender divergences so the

197
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:53,170
other the other challenge is how to pull

198
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,300
the control programs how to purge the

199
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,640
control loops

200
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,900
actually cyber pitch persistent such as

201
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:05,620
logo typical system should I tell I too

202
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:10,420
late allele under control loops to

203
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:12,910
stabilize the pistol operation in this

204
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,130
in appalled this purpose

205
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,760
there are several issues first one is

206
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,990
safety

207
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,959
so specifically we may not want make the

208
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,290
other vehicles crash due to space

209
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,050
safety issues to solve this problem

210
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,750
we're average your hype identity

211
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:37,000
simulator which provide the Butcher

212
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:40,240
physical world this enable us to both

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,600
control loop safely the other one is

214
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,870
efficiency in fact there is a large

215
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,820
testing input space specifically there

216
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,889
are hundred over control parameters and

217
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,680
the large value range for each parameter

218
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:56,170
and there is a wind effect all of those

219
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,709
factors must be considered during the

220
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:02,110
test to overcome this issue we propose a

221
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:05,979
control guided be direct directed

222
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,940
approach this is based on the control

223
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,730
property that we will talk about in the

224
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,639
copper ovals light so here is the

225
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,519
overview oval RB butter and there is a

226
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,709
target program target binary program and

227
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:25,230
then it will interact with the simulator

228
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:27,880
and then it will stand and asleep and

229
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,389
control sensor input and the motor

230
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:36,220
output this studying enable us to is

231
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:39,519
cute control loops safely and then there

232
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,420
will be a ground dealer ground control

233
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,300
station software

234
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,969
Jesus doctor and then it is a connected

235
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,250
to the target program and then it will

236
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,860
send some control command while

237
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:55,449
receiving the control state of the

238
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,699
target program and here we put and

239
00:12:55,449 --> 00:13:01,000
connect our control by the tester and

240
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:05,560
the inside of this tester there is a

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,440
control instability Tector to detect a

242
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,660
bad control program lon and then this is

243
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:17,170
possible because by monitoring the

244
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:19,689
control state and then there okay

245
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,479
depending on this detection desert the

246
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:27,069
controller idle in commutator we mutate

247
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,200
the variable parameter and then win the

248
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:32,380
configuration this

249
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:38,589
us to achieve the high efficiency in

250
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:41,730
testing so let me introduce plain how

251
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:44,490
this contour by the tester works with

252
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:49,420
with us simplify the single parameter

253
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:52,720
mutation example so let's start with the

254
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:59,319
testing with ballistic control game

255
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:01,810
parameter with value 1 if we tested with

256
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,910
this value and with parameter then we

257
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,649
can observe the to relate to the

258
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,130
physical operation first one is a

259
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:11,920
desirable realistic drone as a a gray

260
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,339
gray line and the actual velocity drone

261
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,399
as a orangie line and then as we can see

262
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:22,930
in the figure will actual velocity

263
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,160
tracks the desired velocity very well it

264
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,339
means that there is no control

265
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,160
instability then we can maybe test the

266
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:32,649
more d beta values such as 6 and then as

267
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,560
i described it in the period there is a

268
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:39,130
control instability then we can test the

269
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:42,760
value between 1 and 6 but in this case

270
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:45,250
we are not sure whether they are well

271
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,399
controlled with instability happens or

272
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,640
not but we can predict that

273
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,410
various larger than 6 called control

274
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:58,930
instability this is based on our

275
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,329
monitoring control property increasing

276
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,670
or decreasing the part valuable control

277
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:09,130
parameter will maintain or intensify our

278
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:12,399
control instability then we can keep

279
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:16,630
mutating the input value while

280
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,089
efficiently reaching the input space so

281
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,160
here is an evaluation dessert we test

282
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,380
with other pilot and the export which

283
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:29,050
are the both two popular open source

284
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:31,779
program and we found 89 box and then

285
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,910
during the eight days testing all of

286
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:37,630
them actually will come to order of the

287
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,790
cases and that independently the eight

288
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,769
cases were confirmed by developers and

289
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,939
the seven cases were patched by

290
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,510
developers until now

291
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:49,150
and that we were to know today we use

292
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,400
the open source program only to obtain

293
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:55,329
the ground trust but with our reporter

294
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:59,199
doesn't require source code and then so

295
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,540
as you can see in in this table

296
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,300
they released of large list of mobile

297
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,630
phone number parameters it is bound on

298
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,180
the autopilot actually there's more 4px

299
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:13,360
or and then according to variable each

300
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,599
parameter is short different page called

301
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,440
impact such as a crash or deviation bomb

302
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,140
the trajectory let me enter the to

303
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,840
concrete control semantic bubble

304
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,470
exploitation first one is to control the

305
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,570
maximum more power and then it will

306
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,300
either set as the value within a pink

307
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,330
range it start to short shiver console

308
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,910
instability this is because each

309
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,100
although it sometimes isn't necessary to

310
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,980
generate a maximum power above water but

311
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,580
due to that is limited the maximum Bo

312
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,440
power

313
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,960
it cannot generate the such a maximum

314
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,090
power and that the other parameter is

315
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:59,620
the responsible or angular control gain

316
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:02,170
and then it would dispel you it'll this

317
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,349
value is within a left pink range it

318
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:08,829
does it all over tip you will fail to

319
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,949
track the trajectory as you can see in

320
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,710
the figure so in summary we introduced

321
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:17,290
new types of a control somatic box by

322
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,329
sending a little achievable it is

323
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,940
exploitable by sending a malicious

324
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,429
parameter change in command and then to

325
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,250
discover this contrast Metapod we

326
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:31,080
propose a reporter or psycho-bitch code

327
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,720
system but in tow and then this system

328
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,389
perform controller I the detection of

329
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,140
where the control program done by

330
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,600
detecting

331
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,630
generic control instability properties

332
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,969
and it performs a safe and efficient to

333
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,430
control loop fudging by leveraging a

334
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,090
high-fidelity simulator and control

335
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:55,840
property as a lizard we bound 89 box

336
00:17:52,090 --> 00:18:10,570
from the autopilot and key export

337
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:12,549
so is there any question I think that

338
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,149
was quite interesting can you can you

339
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:18,490
maybe tell me to which degree would

340
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,740
these bucks as you call them be specific

341
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,000
to the physical process so you found us

342
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,070
in control of software is that knowledge

343
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,070
specific to specific drone or is this

344
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,350
would this be a range or Barker as call

345
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,059
that that would essentially apply to you

346
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,760
to a number of different drones that

347
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:35,950
would run with the same software is this

348
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,070
like a problem that is are these values

349
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:42,220
specifically related to the drone model

350
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,960
I mean if you say is 0.8 is the minimal

351
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,360
thrust I can a mix the most faster I can

352
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,860
have maybe have a different drone which

353
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,689
has a different motor and it's a

354
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,850
different value no two which agree is

355
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:56,289
this like a bug that I can fix it in

356
00:18:51,850 --> 00:19:01,570
general control software I'm sorry can

357
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:05,020
you repeat these bugs that you filed

358
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,830
with developers you said you found 90

359
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:11,500
bucks or something like this that that

360
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:15,070
you filed with the developers so I I

361
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:18,039
found 89 yes yes but these are specific

362
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,080
for one model of the drone or this would

363
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,309
be a bug which is specific which would

364
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,928
be in general for the controller

365
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:26,529
software which could also apply to

366
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:28,149
different drones maybe you are talking

367
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:30,580
about the weather this suppose bound

368
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:34,360
problem does some specific model is that

369
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,820
correct yeah yeah I'm wondering if this

370
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,889
applies to one specific model of the

371
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,549
drone or let's say you have whatever

372
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,529
drone more one and drawn model 10 or

373
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,929
whatever which is much newer with this

374
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:48,460
back be the you know you now say that

375
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,010
the maximum thrust has to be at least

376
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,010
0.8 or something is this this case for

377
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,990
both model one and model

378
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,690
the drone or is there something specific

379
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,610
to one drone and wondering how generic

380
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:04,170
these bugs are all these are super

381
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:07,290
specific based on my understanding I

382
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,300
believe your question is that whether I

383
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,340
found this such opposed from the other

384
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,129
pilot and then actually other pilot or

385
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,340
people actually support a lot of O

386
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,510
borders or put into the combination of

387
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,470
the other boarders and and then also

388
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,710
mathematical model also could be

389
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,290
different so it means that are the Palio

390
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,440
support a lot of many private over

391
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:34,340
borders but in my case I actually test

392
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,300
with one specific model that is

393
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:41,040
specifically 3d earth something trivial

394
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:44,100
quadrotor actually he sees the deport

395
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:49,250
borders for testing and then I found

396
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:52,409
this post and from the cheap water but

397
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,650
but and then also widely easier also

398
00:20:52,410 --> 00:21:00,420
true that by desert only compound from

399
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:03,300
the teleport model but I believe our by

400
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,840
design images generally in Episode II it

401
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:15,780
is possible to find a box from the other

402
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:17,100
other control models yes if you would

403
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,899
like to leave it's the end of the

404
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,290
session but we can keep discussing as

405
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,330
well that's you it perfect good well

406
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,170
maybe I'll do what it says no one else

407
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,939
thank you

408
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,270
all right let's thank all of our

409
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,119
speakers again

410
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,119
[Applause]
