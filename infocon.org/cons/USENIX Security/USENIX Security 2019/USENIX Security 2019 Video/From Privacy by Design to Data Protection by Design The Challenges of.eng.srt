1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,660
thank you very much 10 caldo in reaction

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,339
to

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,619
but Chris said even though I'm wearing a

4
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:23,880
suit I'm not a lawyer I'm a technologist

5
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:26,198
by background even though some people

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,970
believe that I'm a lawyer because I've

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,579
been following data protection law for

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:35,949
more like 40 years and different

9
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:38,379
functions and like Oh 13 years now as a

10
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:40,960
full time job and then some people

11
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:44,800
actually thought but I we don't have a

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,229
real uniform at the EDPs but I thought I

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,760
use this cap to indicate that

14
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:52,530
technically I'm a law enforcement

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,500
officer because it's our task to enforce

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,890
data protection law and to have this

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,600
base cap with the EU logo on it is the

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,689
best I can get in that respect but I'm

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,130
normally don't wear that for work so

20
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:10,210
when I come to work it's more like

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:14,439
wearing a suit and no tie to not become

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,360
too Dilbert ish okay I'm talking about I

23
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,789
also come back to some of the issues

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,990
that Chris mentioned like state of the

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:26,799
art and related concepts but I'm talking

26
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,490
about privacy by design not security by

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,069
design

28
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,039
I mean security by design is we learned

29
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:36,549
was born in the 1970s already as a

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:41,520
concept privacy by design as I will

31
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:45,340
explain was born in the 90s as a concept

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,590
brief overview of the talk I go a bit in

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,840
the background and history in the

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,810
context what is actually the EDPs the

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,209
European data protection supervisor

36
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,509
I guess the audience has many

37
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:02,289
non-european members so I I think might

38
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:05,319
be useful then what is what happened

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:08,800
with the GDP are we go from privacy by

40
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,580
design to data protection by design what

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,349
happened what is the difference I'll

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,750
have a look a closer look at GDP our

43
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:19,799
article 25 which is a one on data

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:24,610
protection by design and by default and

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,400
then we have the core concept of state

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,000
of the art on which I will do a little

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,360
bit

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,330
it's not totally different but also not

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,270
totally similar to the one in u.s.

50
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,880
jurisprudence and then have a put for

51
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,830
your questions to the audience which

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,670
don't need to be answered immediately

53
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,850
today but I would also be happy to get

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:53,579
feedback from there and then I say a few

55
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:57,220
words on what we are doing and what the

56
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,950
research community and industry to the

57
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,250
extent that they are participating can

58
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,899
do so the EDPs is the data protection

59
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,770
the independent data protection

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,950
authority for the EU and for the that

61
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:17,650
means in particular the EU institutions

62
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,780
so the EU is not the United States of

63
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,890
Europe so it's not a federal structure

64
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:28,800
but it consists of totally sovereign and

65
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,799
independent states and it has an

66
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,540
supranational structure with its own

67
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:41,500
institutions and staff and by this

68
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,470
construction the EU level itself cannot

69
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,019
be subject to supervision or

70
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,560
jurisdiction in some aspects of the

71
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,870
national authorities and so there must

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,150
be supervisory authorities at the EU

73
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,540
level I mean this is similar you

74
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,700
couldn't have a state supervising

75
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,530
federal authorities in the in the US

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,869
that would be similar difficulty so

77
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,070
that's why there is a European data

78
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,230
protection supervisor in addition to

79
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:14,769
every member say its own data protection

80
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,159
supervisory authorities we have

81
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:23,470
currently two elected members of the

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:26,890
board this is expert assignment so it's

83
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,810
not like party oriented Giovanni Bhutto

84
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,870
le and what's issue Borowski are in

85
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:35,620
office until 5th of December and then

86
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:38,080
the new successor will be come into

87
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,900
office which is currently still to be

88
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,180
alike

89
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,849
by the European Commission and

90
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,840
Parliament and the Council of the

91
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:50,300
European Union the tasks of the EPS is

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,989
the supervision of the processing of

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,390
personal data by the EU institutions

94
00:04:52,990 --> 00:05:00,530
like what are they doing the Commission

95
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,510
is giving out Bob some billions of

96
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,010
grants every year and of course and that

97
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:08,480
contact collects data about grant

98
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,760
recipients about the reviewers the

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,340
experts that help them select their

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,520
something they have some sixty thousand

101
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,590
staff whose DHS process and plenty of

102
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,080
other actions where the issue directly

103
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,960
processes personal data we are also an

104
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,840
adviser as the institution to use a

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,440
legislator the Parliament is very keen

106
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,179
to hear our views while the council the

107
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,640
representation of some Member States

108
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,800
knows everything better than everybody

109
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,539
so they are not very keen to receive

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,730
advice we also have explicitly the task

111
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:49,130
to money to a technological and other

112
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,020
developments which are relevant for data

113
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,390
protection and privacy and of course we

114
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,490
cooperate in formally and informally

115
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,849
with the other data protection

116
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:04,430
authorities within the EU and relevant

117
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:08,780
areas the gdpr became fully applicable

118
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:11,030
on 25th of May last year that is Towell

119
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,719
day for those who are familiar with the

120
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:17,719
Hitchhiker's Guide and I know that one

121
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,290
of the persons involved in negotiating

122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,880
the GDP RS also a big fan of Douglas

123
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,000
Adams so I'm not sure that that was

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,120
totally coincidence but anyway so it's

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,310
easier to remember and the ancestors of

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,760
the GDP are our national and regional

127
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,950
data protection laws in Europe which

128
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:42,770
were adopted in the 1970s we had

129
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:48,170
nationwide laws in Sweden Germany and

130
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:51,049
France in 1973 77 and 78 respectively

131
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,460
and what was common to data protection

132
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,620
laws at the time

133
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,690
they all said well the data has to stay

134
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,370
here in our jurisdiction because we

135
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,100
cannot be sure that they are treated

136
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,840
properly anywhere else in the world and

137
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,010
of course when more and more countries

138
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,190
have laws that restrict the exchange of

139
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,039
data was within companies for example

140
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,250
within multinational companies the

141
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,290
business has become interested in the

142
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,290
ministries of economy also become

143
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:25,520
interested in making sure that this

144
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:28,610
doesn't impede trade so and already in

145
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,620
the 1980s discussion started about

146
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,810
international instruments to find some

147
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,420
way to make it easier to transfer data

148
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,420
from one country personal data from one

149
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,400
country to the other and at European

150
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,650
level it was the Council of Europe which

151
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
is like an organization of nearly all

152
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,830
countries in Europe this totally

153
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,270
distinct from the EU there's some 45

154
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:55,219
member states but includes countries

155
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:59,590
like Russia Serbia Albania Turkey would

156
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:03,080
are not obviously part of the EU and

157
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:06,020
this organization could agree on what

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,020
was then called convention 108 on the

159
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,780
processing of personal data which has in

160
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,330
the meantime been revised over the last

161
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:18,169
couple of years it's now called

162
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:21,349
convention 108 plus has this bit monopod

163
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,860
been modernized to be more aligned with

164
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:28,430
in gdpr and actually it's open for

165
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,750
non-european countries to join so I

166
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:35,840
think there are some in the pipeline

167
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:39,409
Argentina Mexico Canada are considering

168
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:43,790
it and of course the US are totally

169
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:45,589
welcome to join this convention but I I

170
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,510
know that currently they have a bit of

171
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:52,100
problem with international conventions

172
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:54,380
as as a concept but anyway my colleagues

173
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,540
from the CEO either traveling all the

174
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,570
world and inviting countries to join

175
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,870
convention 108 so these are the

176
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,200
ancestors and then starting like in the

177
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,230
90s we

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,660
I would say the parent generation we

179
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,270
have first of 95c Data Protection

180
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,089
Directive which was the common

181
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:19,530
instrument for all EU countries until

182
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:22,290
the 25th of May last year which is

183
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:26,370
accompanied by its younger sister ze

184
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,650
privacy directive which is known to many

185
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:33,900
people more as a cookie law because one

186
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:36,720
of the 16 or so articles has one

187
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,360
paragraph which relates to the placing

188
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,850
of information on a user's device and

189
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,070
reading information from the user's

190
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,050
device that is actually a thing which

191
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,380
refers to cookies by all the rest is

192
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,839
about confidentiality of communications

193
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,770
and related things like what can you do

194
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,170
with the location data of the user which

195
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,439
you collect unfortunately the current

196
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,479
draft was designed just after the first

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,640
digital mobile services and digital

198
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,000
telecommunications and the traditional

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,560
field were made so it was many things of

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,510
location data than the things of

201
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,050
location data that is found by the

202
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:19,350
network server which depends on the cell

203
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,640
tower not on the GPS which is built into

204
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:28,110
each and every mobile device and it's

205
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:34,080
also up for a new review the 2009 review

206
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:38,700
was was done but it's in kind of state

207
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:41,010
of extended pregnancy or hibernation

208
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,340
because the member state governments

209
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:47,250
cannot agree on how much confidentiality

210
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,660
and I want to ground citizens with

211
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,290
respect to their electronic

212
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:56,969
communications there's signals that

213
00:10:52,290 --> 00:11:01,290
might be hope or not that things get off

214
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:04,860
the rock later this year or over the

215
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:09,959
course of next year another sister of

216
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:13,770
the Data Protection Directive was the so

217
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,710
called framework decision 2008 977 on

218
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,730
justice and Home Affairs which is the

219
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,500
data protection

220
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,360
for police and judicial cooperation and

221
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,649
the last one which I mentioned here was

222
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,829
the regulation which actually

223
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,839
establishes the EDPs which defines the

224
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:36,149
data protection rules for the EU

225
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:39,300
institutions themselves and the gdpr has

226
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:41,100
a sibling that is the law enforcement

227
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,689
directive which replaced as a framework

228
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,820
decision and defines the new rules for

229
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,459
data processing in police and judicial

230
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,029
cooperation the instrument which we call

231
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:55,339
the EDP are are the EU data protection

232
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:58,800
regulations which is a new EDPs

233
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:01,620
regulation which defines the processing

234
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,050
rules for the EU institutions themselves

235
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,019
and the privacy regulation which is

236
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:10,740
forthcoming as I said so what actually

237
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,680
so the point I want to make is that GPR

238
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,230
didn't come from nowhere but it has

239
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,569
based on a tradition which goes back

240
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:23,699
like nearly 50 years 45 years and what

241
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,510
does it provide in substance so there

242
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:28,439
was a few things where it provides

243
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,510
clarifications on things which were

244
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,480
already there like the definitions of

245
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,430
what is actually personal data what are

246
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,819
the different roles in the context of

247
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:43,229
processing personal data then there are

248
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:46,139
clarifications on some obligations which

249
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,870
already existed so for example the idea

250
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:53,130
of consent has been elaborated with a

251
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:55,889
lot more clarity but also it means what

252
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:59,970
kind of information do the people need

253
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:03,319
to have before they make a decision is

254
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,720
it possible to actually have consent

255
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:11,160
conditional for using a service the

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,319
answer is legally no and that is one of

257
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,260
the things which is in the process of

258
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:19,589
being becoming subject of enforcement

259
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,319
and judicial action and then at will

260
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,360
hopefully we will see that there's more

261
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:27,120
change transparency there's a lot more

262
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,579
information clearly written down to be

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,640
provided I would actually say on the

264
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:35,739
consent that

265
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:39,100
the usual privacy policy where it says

266
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,280
we value your privacy we will not share

267
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,470
your personal data with anyone except

268
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,480
that we have a legal obligation all we

269
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,670
have good business we see as a party or

270
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,230
we find any other reason why we would

271
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:56,290
like to share it is not up to Mitch the

272
00:13:53,230 --> 00:14:01,240
transparency obligations of the GDP are

273
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:05,199
because its purposes we heard also in in

274
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,140
some soups presentation is to protect

275
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,020
the processing entity against all kinds

276
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,970
of charges of misleading but I mean

277
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,900
because it provides no information it's

278
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,570
not really clarifying anything another

279
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:23,890
element which is becoming very important

280
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,870
is that the GDP are now tries to sort

281
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,180
the situation where more than one entity

282
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,220
is well it's responsible for the

283
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,680
processing that's the concept of joint

284
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,570
controllers just couple of weeks ago

285
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,890
there was a judgement and anybody who

286
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,440
involves a third party

287
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,990
tracker includes a third party tracker

288
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,510
into their website or service they are

289
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,210
at least responsible for the collection

290
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,700
and the transfer of the data and then

291
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:53,170
the actual processing is in the

292
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,840
responsibility of the third party but

293
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,420
basically the two of them are jointly

294
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,790
responsible for the operation and they

295
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,540
need to have an agreement where which

296
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,459
defines where the separation between

297
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,579
responsibilities is two models were a

298
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,440
website operator says yeah I've google

299
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,390
analytics but that's not me I have

300
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,270
nothing to do with it I cannot be

301
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,760
responsible in any way or the other side

302
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:21,189
where the third party says well you know

303
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,590
I do the processing but it's up to the

304
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,810
website operator to get all the things

305
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,570
sorted and proper agreement and proper

306
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:31,000
information for the user neither of

307
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,060
these two models is going to work any

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,180
longer but there must be some structure

309
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,109
which

310
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,689
takes account of the separate and joint

311
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,399
responsibility and then we had some

312
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,089
clarifications on international

313
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,760
transfers which are of course relevant

314
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,970
when I'm here from Europe in the US

315
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,060
under which circumstances actually

316
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,320
companies can transfer data and between

317
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,300
the countries we have some

318
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,060
clarifications on the rights of the data

319
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,689
subjects data subjects in GDP are speak

320
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:09,138
are those whose data is processed so my

321
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:11,720
one of my bosses uses to open speeches

322
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:14,959
by saying ladies and gentlemen the data

323
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:21,079
subjects so you all can be feared

324
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,699
concealed addressed and there's a very

325
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,349
famous talk about something which is

326
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,389
called the right to be forgotten which

327
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,459
is considered by many to be something

328
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:31,449
completely new well it's just the right

329
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:35,680
to erasure of data which is not needed

330
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:38,120
which has existed since the 90s and

331
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,899
there's also some clarification about

332
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,449
the tasks and powers of data protection

333
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:48,709
supervisory authorities and that has of

334
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:51,649
course created much of the hype and

335
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:55,699
interest because that included the

336
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:58,819
clarification on administrative fines

337
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:01,310
the famous four percent of turn over 20

338
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:06,678
million whatever is more or in the

339
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:11,119
context as we will see here to two

340
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,429
percent the there's also some material

341
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,339
changes and new concepts so territorial

342
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:18,949
scope of the GPR has been changed it's

343
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:23,418
always anybody doing processing within

344
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:26,059
the EU subject but now it's made clear

345
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,880
anybody who intentionally process data

346
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:32,530
of people in the EU regardless of the

347
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,210
citizenship is subject to 30 dpr as well

348
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,500
regardless of where they do that on the

349
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,820
planet or also it's a planning

350
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,450
accountability is being introduced as a

351
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,789
new principle and that basically means

352
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,039
ever processes personal data has to be

353
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:52,460
able to show that they are compliant and

354
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,200
this includes some principles data

355
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,299
protection impact assessment as an

356
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,019
obligation in certain cases data

357
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:02,389
protection by design the data protection

358
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:04,309
officer s in general thing and a few

359
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:07,158
more things like certification also is

360
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:10,580
closely related to accountability and

361
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:15,220
then there is a whole new effort to

362
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:19,699
ensure that the GD P R is applied more

363
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:23,269
harmoniously then it used to be in the

364
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,669
past where z/28 countries often had very

365
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,740
different flavor and there's more

366
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,330
instruments on cooperation which is

367
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,539
peer-to-peer cooperation between

368
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:36,408
authorities and a strong consistency

369
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:38,360
mechanism was a special body to organize

370
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:42,860
that the European Data Protection Board

371
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,610
which consists of all of one data

372
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,439
protection authority per country and has

373
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,870
even the possibility to take a majority

374
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,269
vote on a case which covers more than

375
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:59,018
one country when the authorities cannot

376
00:18:53,269 --> 00:19:02,899
find a common ground and then we have

377
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:04,130
taken on board the based on the

378
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:06,469
experience we had in the

379
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,830
telecommunications sector which goes

380
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,320
back to what happened in California many

381
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,949
years ago with personal data breach

382
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,658
notifications as a separate instrument

383
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,350
okay data protection principles which

384
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:23,750
are subject to accountability lawfulness

385
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,299
fairness and transparency purpose

386
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,549
limitation data is collected for certain

387
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,070
purpose and not used for anything

388
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:34,279
incompatible with that data minimization

389
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,820
don't collect and process more data than

390
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,789
it's necessary to achieve your objective

391
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:43,299
accuracy as a data controller you are

392
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:45,919
responsible to ensure that you don't

393
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:48,019
process data which is outdated or

394
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,820
incorrect you cannot keep it forever

395
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,390
there's a limitation to the storage

396
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:58,000
period and

397
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:01,120
security of data is here reduce to two

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,529
of the three standard elements because

399
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,779
loss of availability is probably

400
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:10,809
considered such a severe restriction for

401
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:12,970
the controller himself or itself that I

402
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,289
didn't need to put in legal obligation

403
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,100
here even though there is a more

404
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:20,950
comprehensive model of security later on

405
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,209
I mentioned accountability I put here

406
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:29,429
security again because it's also its own

407
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:35,220
article and the rights of data subjects

408
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:38,639
lawful processing this is also just

409
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,679
necessary and often to repeat it's not

410
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:44,850
notice and choice or notice in content

411
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,789
or something it is content it's one

412
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,490
possible reason for processing and it

413
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:56,049
has to be for specific purposes but the

414
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:58,809
other five elements are also important

415
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,610
it is if there is a contract then data

416
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:04,418
needs to be processed for the completion

417
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,580
of the contract that is covered so when

418
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:10,419
I go to the travel agency and buy an

419
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,480
airline ticket then the travel agency

420
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:15,250
doesn't need to have my explicit

421
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,350
separate consent for telling the airline

422
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,450
who will be their passenger I mean

423
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,129
otherwise they take my money and then

424
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,980
they say without your consent

425
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,419
we cannot buy your ticket so I mean it's

426
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,120
necessary for the completion of the

427
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:32,860
contract and that should be clear that

428
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:38,289
can be legal obligations plenty of them

429
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:41,229
exist like for example just a bank when

430
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:44,799
it takes a big amount in cash has this

431
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,659
obliged to get the identity of the

432
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,570
person who's bringing ten thousand or

433
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:52,539
fifty thousand euros or dollars in cash

434
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,279
just to avoid money laundering so so I

435
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,730
don't need my consent for this because

436
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,520
they are legally obliged to do that the

437
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,100
vital interest of the individual or it

438
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,250
could also be another person is when

439
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,199
after a traffic accident

440
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,620
unconscious on the street of course they

441
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,530
have survived to look whether I have a

442
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:17,050
blood group indication or to collect

443
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:20,710
data of me and so even when I'm not in a

444
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:26,220
position to give any consent and that's

445
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:30,030
not very often then Public Interest is

446
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:35,790
something which goes beyond the concrete

447
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:39,220
legal obligation in as under point C and

448
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:41,190
but important is that for point C in

449
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,710
point E there is a legislative

450
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,570
requirement so the state or any

451
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,160
authority cannot just say oh it's in the

452
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,159
public interest or we process this data

453
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,970
but there must be some legal base to

454
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,160
refer to and then the last item that is

455
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,650
the most complex one legitimate interest

456
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,790
which is actually the most used one

457
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:06,160
because all the web tracking is based on

458
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,129
the concept of legitimate interest

459
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,560
that's why they still thinks I can do it

460
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,380
without transparency or the transparency

461
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,480
obligation applies anyway but I don't

462
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:21,150
that I don't need to ask for consent and

463
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:24,220
so on and this is being developed

464
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:27,310
currently more and more buyers in

465
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,710
European Court of Justice actually the

466
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,730
definition of legitimate interest of the

467
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:36,670
balancing between the interests of the

468
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:39,460
controller and the individual was the

469
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,950
most important part of the famous Google

470
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,490
Spain judgment because the Google Spain

471
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:47,770
judgment which is known for creating the

472
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,060
right to be forgotten or giving the

473
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,370
interpretation of the right to be

474
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,980
forgotten actually had to distinguish

475
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,379
between what is Google's legitimate

476
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,660
interest of forcing personal data in the

477
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:02,590
context of its provision of the search

478
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,690
engine versus where it's the right of

479
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,820
the person whose data is used in this

480
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,430
search process to say stop it

481
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:14,870
that's infringing on my personal rights

482
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:17,540
and in the case of this Spanish dentist

483
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:21,580
the court found that in this specific

484
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:25,360
case his interest of not being connected

485
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:29,679
forever and ever to some mishap in his

486
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:34,459
life history what's more important and

487
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:42,320
the legitimate interest of Google okay

488
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:44,830
the powers of GPAs are based on all the

489
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,320
provisions of the GPR which they have to

490
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,270
enforce so we have the right to ask for

491
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,179
all information that we want and

492
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:56,120
actually not just ask kindly but order

493
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,680
it to be provided also including

494
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:03,310
personal data which you of course have

495
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:08,570
to process with the proper safeguards

496
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:11,149
then we can do certification reviews and

497
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,490
audits on-site and we have the right to

498
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,520
access premises so directly from the law

499
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,110
we don't need as it was in the the old

500
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,610
things sometimes we don't need to go to

501
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,270
the court and get a warrant

502
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,610
like the ICO when they were

503
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:28,370
investigating Cambridge analytical they

504
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,560
also at some point they seize the

505
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,260
service of campus analytical so they

506
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,030
went into a commission and it occurred

507
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,910
premises and took the service and they

508
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,410
are now in the lap of the ico but they

509
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:43,430
needed a court warrant which took

510
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,800
several days and so the provider knew

511
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,350
for quite a while that they were going

512
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,840
to come and if nobody knows what was

513
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,659
happening on the on the side during

514
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,230
these four or five days that it took so

515
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:00,080
this is basically should not happen now

516
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:04,390
with the GPR because I should be able to

517
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,340
access it immediately and the

518
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:10,910
authorities can instruct controllers to

519
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:13,520
be compliant issue warnings but also say

520
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:18,320
stop this processing operation change it

521
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:23,240
and if you want to to read the fifty

522
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,460
million euro finding decision of the

523
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,830
French Data Protection Authority against

524
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:32,139
Google

525
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:34,750
it's not only an amount which by normal

526
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:37,629
perception probably doesn't make a

527
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,330
visible dent into Google's and your

528
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:43,240
result but it also has instructions on

529
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,129
how they may or may not continue

530
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,480
processing which may be much more

531
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:52,600
effective if it is properly implemented

532
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,049
we can also totally stop a processing

533
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:03,519
operation say miss for a data flow both

534
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:06,190
internal or externally and when data

535
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,960
subjects don't get the data they asked

536
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,960
for subject access requests are not

537
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:15,549
responded to or any of the other things

538
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:21,250
or if data breaches are not reported

539
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:23,139
then the authority can order the also

540
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,970
the controller's to do that and not

541
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:27,309
following an order of course is the

542
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,259
worst infringement and not doing what

543
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,470
they were obliged to in the first place

544
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:36,870
and then the last we saw of course are

545
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:40,480
the fines which get so much interest so

546
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:43,149
from privacy by design to data

547
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,110
protection by design privacy by design

548
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:50,340
was in the discussion since 95 in the

549
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:54,309
first papers it's a high-level framework

550
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:57,279
would be difficult to enforce and the

551
00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:00,610
GPR approach is data protection by

552
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:05,409
design and by default we use the acronym

553
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:07,029
d BB D D and if you want to be cool and

554
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,490
show that you have mathematical or

555
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:12,929
technical background and you say D P BD

556
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:15,100
square and then some lawyers already

557
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:19,090
don't understand how there can be a

558
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:21,459
square and an acronym it's based on the

559
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,549
accountability concept and the

560
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,730
principles of data protection because

561
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,340
it's one of the obligations by which the

562
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,289
controlling entity can show that say

563
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,529
I've understood and are compliant with

564
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:38,169
the rules it's a legal obligation so

565
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:39,610
it's no longer good practice and

566
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,510
violation maybe

567
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:48,040
find up to the higher of ten million

568
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:52,059
years or 2% of the turnover up to I mean

569
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,770
that is also often misinterpreted it's

570
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,720
not as if there's any violation

571
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,540
automatically goes to the maximum fine

572
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:05,290
but there is of course a long range of

573
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:09,960
at appreciation and certification may

574
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:12,909
help to achieve compliance and

575
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,730
demonstrate that accountability has been

576
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:18,340
taken into account and of course they

577
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:21,419
need to be appropriate standards against

578
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:25,629
which to certify and certification

579
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:27,910
organizations privacy by design document

580
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:31,780
on the left hand side is a publication

581
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:36,130
from the Ontario Privacy Commissioner we

582
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:38,530
see five principles document on the

583
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,950
right hand side is an opinion of the

584
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:44,379
EDPs which we published last year where

585
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,210
we explored the concept of privacy by

586
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,480
design elaborated a bit on the

587
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:53,710
difference between privacy by design and

588
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,440
data protection by design and basically

589
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:59,049
we call it preliminary opinion because

590
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,419
we invite the relevant community to

591
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:05,400
comment on it so that we can develop

592
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:08,020
that and maybe have one day second

593
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,230
generation of this document so you're

594
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,960
all invited to go to our website find

595
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:18,610
this document read it and send comments

596
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:22,450
to us or me personally so that we can

597
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:25,840
integrate this serious invitation so

598
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,970
it's not just to say so the article as I

599
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,659
said data protection by design and by

600
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,870
default those elements are buyers away

601
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:38,799
present in the in the privacy by design

602
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:43,439
concept earlier already but here they

603
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:47,440
are separate legal obligations and

604
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,419
basically the by default means if there

605
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,659
is a choice to collect more or less data

606
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:57,460
than you should start with less data

607
00:30:52,659 --> 00:31:04,509
only go more by when the user actively

608
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:16,119
changes the default well that's a long

609
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:17,320
slide with a full text and it there

610
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,259
should be some highlighting which

611
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:26,859
apparently has somehow disappeared in

612
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:28,989
the reading process but there's a lot in

613
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:30,999
the first part there's a lot of factors

614
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:33,309
which are to be taken into account and

615
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:36,609
it starts with the state of the art then

616
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:39,779
there is a reference to cost the kind of

617
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:43,539
processing and the risks of varying

618
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:45,609
likelihood and severity so clearly there

619
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:48,249
is a reference to state of the art risk

620
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:51,009
management but privacy risk management

621
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:52,809
not security risk management and then

622
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:57,099
the controller shall take appropriate

623
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:58,809
measures to implement the data

624
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:02,009
protection principles which we have seen

625
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:06,279
a few slides before and to integrate

626
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:09,389
safeguards and the measures shall be

627
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,940
taken both at the time of the

628
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:15,820
determination of seed processing means

629
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,509
and purposes that is design phase as

630
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,689
well as at the productive operation so

631
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:27,639
it's trying to to cover the entire

632
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:30,220
lifecycle of software operation one

633
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:32,678
concept which will be very relevant in

634
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,179
assessing concrete cases is of course

635
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,470
the state of the art in Europe we have

636
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,960
jurisprudence on this in consumer

637
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,299
protection law which is a bit similar

638
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,119
maybe to what we have here we have also

639
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:48,999
in concepts on this and environm

640
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:50,678
environmentally but it's just not

641
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:54,940
allowed to pollute more than is

642
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,859
technically necessary and actually this

643
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,559
still needs to develop for for data

644
00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:01,539
protection but we have the extinction of

645
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,070
different levels of state of the art so

646
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,730
there's the cutting edge the most

647
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,129
advanced

648
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:09,970
there is that what is commonly

649
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:12,789
considered standard practice by every

650
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,940
decent professional in the field and

651
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:23,519
then there may be areas where this is

652
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:28,210
not yet fully there and we consider that

653
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,010
this is a well in data protection law we

654
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,830
had the term already in the security

655
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:37,360
article which is basically unchanged

656
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:39,850
since 95 it's a dynamic concept our

657
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,379
state of the art now inside of the art

658
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:45,908
in two years is thanks to all the

659
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,010
wonderful researchers which are meeting

660
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:53,320
here is not the same as be progress and

661
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:55,600
but we as the Supervisory authorities

662
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,760
and of course also the organization's

663
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,820
processing data we have to have some

664
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,440
kind of common understanding what is the

665
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,799
state of the art because we have to be

666
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,139
able to tell an organization this was

667
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,780
state of the art or this was not and the

668
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,700
two recent finds that Chris already

669
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,510
mentioned to one against British Airways

670
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:18,819
and Mariette hotel organizations were

671
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,669
quite high because among other things

672
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:24,639
they really made stupid mistakes in the

673
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:31,179
security area in that case but I mean

674
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:34,450
storing sensitive data in unencrypted on

675
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:37,089
web accessible server I mean this is not

676
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,560
the state of the art so and all the

677
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:40,929
cases which were mentioned in other

678
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,839
presentations today whereas passwords

679
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,210
are stored in clear text on servers

680
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,168
expected accessible to the Jutes number

681
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:54,310
of people of course was definitely not

682
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:56,259
state of the art standardization would

683
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:59,140
help there are several initiatives

684
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,589
ongoing at ISO and other standardization

685
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:05,920
organizations to establish privacy

686
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:09,910
standards and the GPR has the ambition

687
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:14,500
also to to trigger an advancement of the

688
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:16,220
state of the art in general and here are

689
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,260
four questions

690
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:22,750
let's see questions I announce questions

691
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:25,730
to the audience not from the audience

692
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:29,560
one which could be I mean we had soups

693
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:33,349
and pepper from Sunday to yesterday

694
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,490
conference on usable privacy and

695
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:39,680
security and on privacy engineering

696
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,259
practice and respect these are of course

697
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,200
sources to learn where do we stand and

698
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:49,030
of course sir I think at this hotel

699
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,578
these days are the people who can give

700
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:56,569
valuable comments on the first question

701
00:35:52,579 --> 00:36:00,770
I originally said I thought I would put

702
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:05,000
up three options like saying 100 percent

703
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:08,150
yes it depends and three definitely not

704
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,609
but I mean everybody would probably go

705
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,500
for B anyway so I would rather ask what

706
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:14,630
does it depend on

707
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,440
and that goes was the second question

708
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:21,050
where are the gaps in the current state

709
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,569
of the art which fields of privacy what

710
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,670
do we need more do we have the concept

711
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,470
is adjustable practice so people have

712
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,500
been talking about layered privacy

713
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:33,259
notices icons about the processing

714
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:37,160
operations possibility to have easy like

715
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:40,310
a nutrition label on a service to decide

716
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:44,029
on whether you want to do it or not so

717
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:46,430
there are ideas are they sufficiently

718
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:49,910
material do we need more research and I

719
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:53,118
think one area where we which I learned

720
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:56,690
from soups in particular is that the

721
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,750
human factor in these interfaces as

722
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:03,230
something which developers need to learn

723
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:07,430
a bit lot more about and very glad to

724
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:09,910
see that is really great research the

725
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:15,220
role of the public sector as I said it's

726
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:15,220
expected that the public sector provides

727
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:22,940
incentives and the last point is all the

728
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:25,609
obligations of the GDP are apply only to

729
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,940
the organizations that actually process

730
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:32,848
the data

731
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:40,190
so when an organization buys devices

732
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:43,710
like TVs for IOT devices which are not

733
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:46,230
come without being connected to their

734
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,480
manufacturers services at the time which

735
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,950
is often the case but imagine it's

736
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,930
really like the hardware and the

737
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,029
programs in the art where these

738
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,368
suppliers themselves are not subject to

739
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,250
sanctions under the GDP are only their

740
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:04,740
customers who use that to provide

741
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:07,950
services and so good ideas to up the

742
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:12,930
incentives for the manufacturers and

743
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:16,020
developers is also very welcome

744
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:18,149
what are the DPH doing or we we do

745
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,839
enforcement I'll have a slide on that in

746
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,220
a minute

747
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:27,359
we develop guidance both individually by

748
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:31,470
each DPA and also in the EDP be there

749
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,538
was work ongoing and of course we have

750
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,569
our own exchanges with other

751
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:39,779
organizations partly at places like this

752
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:42,839
but also in specific events and

753
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:45,920
cooperation groups and of course we are

754
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:50,160
very interested in cooperation with

755
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:54,470
research we can not ourself participate

756
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,490
in in research projects due to two legal

757
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,598
constraints but everything which is

758
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:03,470
below the level of direct participation

759
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,720
we can be very interested in cooperating

760
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,899
also with academia and research

761
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:14,700
institutions on enforcement that was

762
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:17,819
just about a months ago the first fine

763
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,649
which actually referred to article 25

764
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:22,859
data protection by design by the

765
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:27,660
Romanian data protection Authority which

766
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:30,598
find a bank for a mistake in the user

767
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:33,118
interface in online banking I think it

768
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,799
was because Romania is a country where

769
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,029
every citizen as a citizen ID which is

770
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,170
probably worse than a social security

771
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:44,520
number in

772
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:46,140
effect when it is stolen and it was the

773
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,770
program was implemented so that

774
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:54,450
everybody who received a transfer would

775
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:57,000
see the sender's citizen ID in their

776
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,160
bank statement which was totally

777
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,829
unnecessary so you could also argue it

778
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,109
was a violation of data minimization but

779
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,849
the bank itself didn't do anything with

780
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:09,569
it other than displaying it I had to

781
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:13,500
store it because of national banking law

782
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:15,450
but showing it in the and the user

783
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,599
interface program was definitely a

784
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:22,308
mistake in the design of the software

785
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:25,380
which should be there so the authority

786
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:29,010
decided that a violation of article 25

787
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:33,359
was one of the reasons to issue this

788
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:37,079
fine and there may be more coming

789
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,109
forward we ourselves at the EPS we have

790
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:46,069
issued guidelines on several aspects

791
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:48,540
already over the past four years on IT

792
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:51,740
governance and management which is the

793
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:56,910
framework and specific services and

794
00:40:51,740 --> 00:41:00,779
activities all of this is up for review

795
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:03,990
I was in our next year I think until

796
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,680
next year sometime to be fully compliant

797
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:09,299
with our new regulation we have set up

798
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,379
what we call the internet privacy

799
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:15,900
engineering network open where we

800
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:18,210
cooperate with industry academia DPS and

801
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:23,490
what I forgot to mention year civil

802
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:26,460
society it was triggered in 2013 by

803
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:31,529
particular the reaction of the internet

804
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:33,780
engineering task force community on the

805
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,760
weaknesses that were revealed and the

806
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:39,150
technical standards of the internet we

807
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,180
started in 2014 we have a workshop every

808
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:46,079
year at least one and we also had a few

809
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:48,149
special events the next one is the next

810
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,650
workshop is in Lisbon in June next year

811
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:54,359
and we probably have one

812
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:57,869
two other workshops in between and of

813
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:00,930
course industry and researchers are in

814
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:04,920
vited this year in Rome we talked again

815
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:08,009
state-of-the-art business models that

816
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,220
can work without tracking privacy

817
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:13,380
engineering methodologies and opinion

818
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,109
and minimization versus pseudonym

819
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,940
ization we had four conclusions so

820
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:21,269
there's more privacy engineering than

821
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,559
most people think and there is and that

822
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:24,890
is very interesting there's more

823
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,259
consensus even across borders of

824
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:31,440
legislations and because on the

825
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:33,720
engineering level as a guidance which is

826
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,180
produced by NIST the National Institute

827
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,549
of Standards and Technology in the US

828
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,578
and the guidance that is produced by the

829
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:43,559
technically oriented teams of the data

830
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:47,460
protection authorities in Europe are

831
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,289
very very compatible and that means from

832
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,880
the engineering perspective even though

833
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:55,079
the legal frameworks are totally

834
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:59,190
different there is a lot of common

835
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:02,849
ground that was very encouraging we

836
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:05,460
thought there's many elements were we

837
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:09,660
know what is the right thing to do but

838
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:12,359
not for all points as explained at

839
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,598
developer developer level so when we

840
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:17,160
talk to developers even in our own

841
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,869
supervised institutions they often say

842
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,999
yeah I can read your guidance but I

843
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:23,489
still don't know how to program this so

844
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:25,589
I need to even more detail them which

845
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:27,269
library is good to use which library

846
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:30,749
should I avoid and all this kind of

847
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:33,209
things and of course dissemination

848
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:34,890
training I think there's hardly any

849
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,900
speaker of today who hasn't said that a

850
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,328
symbol need for for training and

851
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:43,400
education and also dissemination to

852
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:46,529
practitioners what we do that's what we

853
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,950
kind of will include in our new

854
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:53,430
manifesto thinking about new ways of

855
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:55,259
spreading some knowledge working test

856
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:59,270
will be really the heartbeat is number

857
00:43:55,259 --> 00:44:01,730
two to really break this down so that

858
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:04,210
managers and developers and the

859
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:07,369
corporate IT can do that we need

860
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:13,070
community to fill the gaps and so we'll

861
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:16,570
also need to maintain the community and

862
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:20,510
that this is this slide has kind of

863
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:23,660
effect to it so that's my last regular

864
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,940
slide and think I'm also close to the

865
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:37,970
end of time so thank you very much for

866
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:40,760
your thank you so any question just to

867
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:44,950
just give you with four minutes so I

868
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,180
think to three questions average shorts

869
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:50,359
okay I'm gonna preface this with I am

870
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,700
NOT a lawyer article 28 of the gdpr

871
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,869
lays out the if I remember correctly

872
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:58,609
lays out the processor and controller

873
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:59,960
separations of duties one of the

874
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,050
interesting things that I noticed about

875
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,840
this is that in practice what that's

876
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:09,140
doing is its pushing companies to use

877
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,250
larger and larger processors and sub

878
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,650
processors because the notification

879
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:18,490
burden is so high and getting people to

880
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:20,930
sign off explicitly on every new

881
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,160
processor is the burden of that is

882
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:24,529
really high and it makes it a lot easier

883
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,180
if you use larger processors and I don't

884
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,560
think that's intended and I don't know

885
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,270
I'm not saying that this is a bad

886
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:33,259
breakdown I like a lot of things about

887
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:35,390
it but there was a lot of people were

888
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,700
talking a lot about hey let's make sure

889
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:40,430
we don't burden small business more than

890
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,649
large business and do you have any ways

891
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:45,680
you think you could tweak that to maybe

892
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:47,300
make that not have this push towards

893
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,660
larger companies in the marketplace

894
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,880
yeah the short answer is and I can give

895
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,430
you a longer one suppose the short

896
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,240
answer is this is very much due to the

897
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:02,930
hype and fear that has been distributed

898
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,819
we think that it we find that in

899
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,190
countries where data protection has been

900
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:11,110
taken seriously also small and medium

901
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:13,430
enterprises are fine with maintaining

902
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,260
look I'm not saying that I'm staying

903
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:20,450
specifically when you're when you're

904
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:22,550
getting processors hmm yes because no no

905
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:25,189
I mean yeah yeah I think it's a

906
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:26,270
misperception by the by the organization

907
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,920
that's the short answer

908
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:34,820
okay hello I'm Jeffrey Goldberg DPO at

909
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,930
one password one thing that I've noticed

910
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:42,340
in or noticed missing in the privacy by

911
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,830
design documents is the role of

912
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:49,970
end-to-end encryption using keys that

913
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:55,100
are only that that belong only to the

914
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:58,490
data subject and I found just in dealing

915
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:01,069
with with the regulations that there

916
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:04,549
does not seem to be a recognition of

917
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:09,140
that as a as both the core of privacy by

918
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:12,440
design but also really as a possibility

919
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:16,609
yeah I understand this but I think this

920
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:18,710
is just due to was already difficult

921
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:20,810
enough to get legislature understand

922
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,390
what encryption is in the first place

923
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:25,580
and then going into the difference

924
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,100
whether the controller owns the keys or

925
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:31,040
the user owns the keys up step too far

926
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:36,259
for the law but it's something that we

927
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:38,300
can address in the guidance ah him and

928
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:40,160
Chris you both addressed the notion of

929
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,770
state of the art and what he means for

930
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,470
security requirements and the second

931
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:46,700
kind of like requirement in in the text

932
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,160
that you showed us is like cost of

933
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,509
implementation and for me kind of like I

934
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,149
thought I got an a had an idea about

935
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:55,280
what state of the art means but in

936
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,630
conjunction with this a cost of

937
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,330
implementation this becomes a very

938
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:01,970
relative concept and I'm curious if you

939
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:03,830
can help us better understand how we

940
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:07,720
have to understand this notion of cost

941
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:10,250
of implementation good question

942
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,819
Chris has mentioned the concept of

943
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:18,500
cost-benefit analysis and we tend to

944
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:22,050
interpret the cost argument as something

945
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,060
which must be really the cost which are

946
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,830
additional to anything that the

947
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,240
controller would do for their own

948
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:33,620
interests and also when better privacy

949
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:35,939
solutions actually improve the business

950
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,609
effect of the software that cannot be

951
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,970
taken as the cost of the privacy

952
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:44,520
implementation so but indeed that's a

953
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:46,950
complex issue and the accounting

954
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:51,870
background of course is also quite

955
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:57,779
interesting but we have debts in the eye

956
00:48:51,870 --> 00:49:00,540
and anyway it cannot be like you cannot

957
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,280
store passwords in clear-text just by

958
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,550
saying well I wouldn't need a bigger

959
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,160
processor to encrypt them before I store

960
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,380
them so that would not be a valid

961
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,540
argument even by the by the cost angle

962
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,480
because I need balances against the

963
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,980
damage but but it somehow makes the

964
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,080
concept a little bit more relative is

965
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,680
that right yeah unfortunately the

966
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,910
legislators very keen on having

967
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:29,310
everything taken into account

968
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:33,180
yeah thank you I am calvin zito with

969
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:35,759
uber so I've questioned about GDP as to

970
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:39,589
how would it apply to government

971
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:42,330
agencies I mean in light of this a

972
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:44,900
high-profile features and right the

973
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:49,740
revenue model and penalty doesn't know

974
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:51,840
yeah the well I mean we have we are

975
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:56,189
dealing with government agencies as in

976
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:58,140
DPS exclusively we have the power to

977
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,910
find them but as you say it doesn't

978
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,009
really make much sense because in the

979
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,440
state budget goes from one institution

980
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,210
to the other institution and actually it

981
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,010
doesn't go to us but it goes back into

982
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:11,520
the general budget so nobody earns

983
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,010
anything and the the damage would only

984
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:18,030
be secondary because someone who causes

985
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:19,740
his authority to lose budget can be

986
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,170
personally be made responsible for

987
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:25,919
losing this budget so that's a very

988
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:28,230
complex thing at national level this may

989
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,600
be more different because it not all on

990
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,250
the same budget and in principle all

991
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,580
authorities which are not

992
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:38,369
or justice are subject to the GDP are

993
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:40,319
directly and only for police and justice

994
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,060
authorities as a separate regime and

995
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,359
they are also under supervision of the

996
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:47,849
National Supervisory authorities but

997
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,799
member states had to Martin to decide

998
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:51,960
whether they what kind of sanctions they

999
