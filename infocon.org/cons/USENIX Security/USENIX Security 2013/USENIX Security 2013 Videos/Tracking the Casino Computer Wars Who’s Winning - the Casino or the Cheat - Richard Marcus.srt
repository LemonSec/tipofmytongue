1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,750
I am the experiment and the

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,220
two months ago or so I got an email from

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,560
Michael here and he said the

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,029
this is something that might interest
you coming to USENIX

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,360
and the I didn't obvious I'd never hart
use nicks

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,100
and I really didn't know if you wanted
me to speak because he didn't say

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,630
anything in the first email

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,360
and I said well you want me to speak and
he said

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,900
sure and I said okay and a

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,890
not having her a few snakes I thought
there was a

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,899
a little type of an organization or

12
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,590
not because I hadn't heard that I just
just didn't realize

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,680
what it was so I got here Wednesday

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,950
and I arrived here about two in the
afternoon

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,030
and I trickle-down down here and the

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,360
I peeked in and won the conference's and
mom saying

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,820
ahead of Google security head of
microsoft

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,199
security systems analysis %uh the next
day the keynote speech by

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,729
somebody from our cyber security at the
white house

20
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,580
and I set for myself you know what am I
getting into here are

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,440
that I get off on the wrong bus was I
supposed to be in Washington State and

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,940
not washington DC

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,130
and of another thing I wanna tell you or
admit to you

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,740
is I know less about computers

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,130
and cyber Technology naw love you know

26
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,560
about see no cheating which means I know

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,620
absolutely nothing saw when I doing here

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,510
a ask Michael Bailey um

29
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,340
all kidding aside arm how many how many
people here have

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,680
not have never played roulette into
getting a lot of gambling casino

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,330
I up

32
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,750
well I hope you'll get some
entertainment value added this

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,760
presentation

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,479
%ah how many of you will never been in a
gambling casino period

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,250
okay with that I can deal with that

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,250
on good of so I I just said that I don't
know anything about computers or

37
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,200
computer

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,810
a technology will excuse me or I'll

39
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,160
hacking or anything like that but

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,840
what I do know is the human factor
everything I've heard here and I i've

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,530
kind o

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,750
saw during the presentations and I've
kinda suspect this before

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,660
it's all been about computer protecting
against

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,010
attack from computer it's all about
information systems

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,250
there to protect information and how

46
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,750
somebody hacked into it and then how the
the person designing the

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,270
security software then takes the next
step and tries to prevent the hacker and

48
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,800
it's a a cat-and-mouse game

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,290
and obviously something %uh

50
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,630
that nature to me i cant do anything to

51
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,739
to attack a computer I can be a computer

52
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,480
but what happens when you take the
computer

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,730
with all the defense systems in it and
you take it out all the internet and you

54
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,349
take it out on the cyber world and you
put it in the real world like in a bank

55
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,569
or a casino

56
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,690
then you have to deal with people like
me

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,470
who I'm above average intelligence but I
have a knack

58
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,900
up knowing how to defeat surveillance
and computer systems

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,150
and that's what I'm here to talk about
I'm here to try and give a human

60
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,890
aspect as to what what goes on in the
real world with computers

61
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,579
verses a the cyber world and that and
that's the that's the experiment that's

62
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,160
the difference between a

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,310
you know what I'm here for and what
everybody else on

64
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,000
has has spoken about so what I want to
do all

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,209
basically for for 25 years I did nothing

66
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,519
%uh but she gambling casinos a

67
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,980
all across the world out what some money
and

68
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,649
I started doing this when I was actually
on the rage

69
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,690
to gamble I was about eighty and at the
time legal age again was 21 and I would

70
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,129
just go to Las Vegas in

71
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,610
I you know it's a long story I've
written books about this if anyone

72
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,629
should get interested you can go to my
website Richard Marcus books dot com and

73
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:29,590
you can read about it

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,698
or read my book or whatever but anyway
to to get right to the point

75
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,340
are back in the late 80s a

76
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,560
when I was known by virtually every

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
casino interpol agency every Las Vegas

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,800
surveillance so administrator
surveillance chief

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,220
I was known as the best casino cheat in
the world

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,639
and I had in a poll after me I had many
many the

81
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,190
investigations FBI this and that

82
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,630
and nobody could ever catch up with me
nobody can ever gallery

83
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,760
evidence on me and finally so it said

84
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,400
by other people that in nineteen eighty
nine or so

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,530
all Las Vegas and many other gambling
areas

86
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,020
they turned to what was called the eye
in the sky 24-hour

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,409
video surveillance where they film

88
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,610
every second %uh every table

89
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,050
nonstop in casinos and to this day
that's how casino surveillance works

90
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,150
in the old days they would have maybe
one rotating camera

91
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,530
for a for three or four tables what so
it said because to me they decided to

92
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,859
revamp

93
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,210
all their surveillance to to stop people
like me

94
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,370
and then it was actually put to me

95
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,600
to figure out a way to beat that and so
we're gonna start we're gonna

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
show little video on I'll excuse me this
first video is a little grainy but

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,440
you'll catch it

98
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,180
II in by 11 sec if we put on I

99
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,130
invented this move a movie is a casino
cheating move

100
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,139
that actually I used a surveillance
cameras

101
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,310
filming Michi but being my ally

102
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,669
helping me cheat instead of helping the
casino catch me

103
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,520
and when this when this thing went
public I wrote a book about it and I

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,299
went public and they made a few TV shows
about it

105
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,789
and then I one on each machine a minute
I one on the NBC Today Show and

106
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,270
demonstrated the move

107
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,680
someone to show you this move just to
give you an idea

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,850
of how easy it is

109
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,090
for for somebody who was no computer
experience no knowledge in anything it's

110
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,310
just a guy

111
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,740
more or less in the street who could
figure out a way

112
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,550
to be all this multi-million-dollar
state-of-the-art surveillance equipment

113
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,550
so let's let's take a look at this video

114
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,720
of psychologic okay let's go over the
roulette table because you have another

115
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,880
scam here do you call savannah is that
right yes this is the best casino

116
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,409
shooting will ever concocted

117
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,650
%ah this came up with it yes I just saw
something here we have a roulette layout

118
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,090
we have chips on the inside and all
these are ten dollar bets to 10 or 15

119
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,049
dollar bets five-dollar chips

120
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,630
I come over to the table and I have a
cocktail glass in my hand

121
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,289
and I simply bet the five thousand five
dollars this is a five thousand dollar

122
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,400
chip and I bet

123
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
angled so the deal cannot see the bottom
chip underneath

124
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,460
okay the door spins the ball if I moves

125
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,750
were gonna say that it comes on a losing
note the same number nine right

126
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,470
I lose and I quickly grabbed the soft
and I put it in my pocket

127
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,000
time I call and it's a deal catches me
put that the doses put that backed out

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,870
put that out so what are you going
eyeball to a drop or two night ago I'm

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,930
sorry I didn't know that the but lost
I'm sorry I put it back down but when I

130
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,100
put down his ten dollars

131
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,000
not five thousand five dollars the five
South the dealer never saw a five

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,410
thousand dollar chip seal the deal think
it's only ten dollars and I'm a drunk

133
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,020
and I'm acting like this

134
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,880
and now there's no big deal because it's
only about ten dollars and they don't

135
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,039
call security

136
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,380
but if fact that had one

137
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,630
it's five thousand get me that a yes I
think it is is it pays ten thousand ten

138
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,750
dollars or up to the maximum bet

139
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,229
and they call the eye in the sky because
nobody called out they have to call out

140
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:18,949
a big bet

141
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,099
alright but but got that finish up and
if they don't call me that

142
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,500
you know nobody called nobody saw it so
I verify it with the tape and I see that

143
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,050
actually was up from the bottom line is
I went ten thousand dollars 110 that

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,079
when xylose ten dollars when it was
alright but you have to be pretty stupid

145
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,088
to do this right Richard

146
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:37,050
very stiff yeah okay and you don't do
this anymore i picture

147
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,848
okay

148
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,880
you notice I caught it at the right time
and you also notice how law

149
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,540
love what's her name again that woman
the

150
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,910
about memory Meredith Vieira

151
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,380
at a you knows how quickly she was
pushing me to get me off the set as

152
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,100
quickly as possible so I was in a rush

153
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,170
but basically let me just explain real
fast what I did

154
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,120
I would walk into a casino with two
chips

155
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,240
one the bottom chip was a maximum value
chip whatever the casino had in that

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,290
case it was five thousand dollars

157
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,770
the top chip was five dollars both chips
for the same size

158
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,400
I put it down on the layout and I
purposely joining out

159
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,560
the five in our chip of the five
thousand dollar chips or the dealer

160
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,750
wouldn't see

161
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,610
everybody in a stable the dealer is that
there was one who spends the wall okay

162
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,670
I mean to offend anybody but you know

163
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,229
since someone help the room was never
played roulette I have to explain a

164
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,580
little

165
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,690
okay so the point was won the bet

166
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,980
one when the bat lost I wasn't gonna let
them take my five thousand and five

167
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,510
dollars

168
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,370
so before the dealer could actually
grabbed the winning bet losing battle of

169
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,980
the layout

170
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,000
I would go out and grab it and if's most
of the time I wouldn't be seen but when

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,940
I was seen

172
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,750
I immediately because the deal was
reaction would be very negative they

173
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,190
will go head start that's losing that
put it back down

174
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,440
my show I think it's ten dollars but
it's five thousand dollars will follow a

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,200
chip on top

176
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,930
and I would immediately call oh and when
you say it all to me although I didn't

177
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,930
know the ball drop

178
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,650
I would call to drop routine and why
that why am I doing this it's all

179
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,620
psychology

180
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,590
it's all to sell that I'm just some
idiot who was out there so drunk and

181
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,430
slobbering that I pick up my bed after
it lost

182
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,510
and since it's only ten dollars and the
eye in the sky surveillance is not

183
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,370
concerned about a ten dollar bet

184
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,570
nobody gets upset the the the pit boss
to the supervisor comes over and the do

185
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,130
and he sees me too on on slobbering
around like this

186
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,390
well I don't know what you can take me
anywhere and they just three and they

187
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:37,930
just for

188
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,890
and I just forget about me okay now what
happens if the bet one

189
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,199
hear his words his work it's good now
the five thousand and five dollars bet

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,680
on this at a maximum that and it winds
what happens

191
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,120
the dealer in casinos when it when
anyone bats

192
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,010
say more than a hundred dollars the deal
has to call it out to the supervisor

193
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:03,230
all roulette whatever number one I have
a hunter or chip for a 5-under or chip

194
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,160
whatever it is they have to call it

195
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,660
out and I know this now the deal didn't
see the bet

196
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,140
the five thousand dollar chip the dealer
could not have called it out

197
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,540
so won the bet wins and I start I go yes
it one and I start dancing around and go

198
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,439
with you

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,250
and i won cuz it's five thousand dollars
there there was no I'm talking about the

200
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,050
door think some

201
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,300
on drunken stop it now for only: I point
where I say take a look the deal appeals

202
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,609
of the five-dollar chips

203
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,760
on top of the five thousand dollar chip
and boom bites a light bite him or her

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
right in the nose

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,699
know what is a dealer to the deal has to
tell supervisor the supervisor comes

206
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,300
over

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,810
and seizes five thousand dollar bet and
that's a huge huge bet

208
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,910
nobody bats that a in casinos nobody got
five thousand dollars on red or black or

209
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,880
arm

210
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,890
arming even raw nobody does except super
high rollers

211
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,020
so now the casino is suspicious

212
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,470
they're suspicious because all the Sun
and the blue so many but five thousand

213
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,950
dollars

214
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,630
nobody saw it so what do they think they
think I'm cheating

215
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,110
what do they do anybody have an idea
what they do they think I'm cheating

216
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,110
checked the video so they called the
phone ya roulette table for audio guy

217
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,630
standing there in a green shirt

218
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,640
and glasses he the he claims he but five
thousand dollars nobody saw made the bet

219
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,060
I'm sure he's cheating let's run back to
tape a

220
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,359
let's get the evidence and then let's
get him arrested let's get a mine jail

221
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
soon as possible

222
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,730
okay and I know that's what their
mindset as I know that's what they're

223
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,250
thinking

224
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,720
and I'm standing here you know a thing
like this and are then they get the

225
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,750
phone call back from the on the sky now
remember

226
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,450
this is after because of me that they
want

227
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,790
to have 24-hour tape on all the game so
I know they had on tape

228
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,180
so security a surveillance calls back

229
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,839
and sort what a surveillance tell the
people down at the blackjack table

230
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,140
they saw the bet was what

231
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,990
legitimate

232
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,060
in other words while the war spending I
didn't make any move

233
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,260
the deal with the other ways of no more
bets I didn't do anything I made my bed

234
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,510
early

235
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,689
surveillance calls up calls down and
says legitimate

236
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,510
legitimate but you have to pay now when
I did this one time five times ten times

237
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,130
by the 50th time

238
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,550
they all knew all the head surveillance
people like

239
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,670
like many of you people here are our
head the security people for on

240
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,959
information systems and computers all
the same types of people

241
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,270
in Las Vegas know it's me because
they're filming me as I'm waiting to be

242
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,079
paid

243
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,150
that's Richard market he's the biggest
cheater in the world

244
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,520
video surveillance is telling us he's
not cheating

245
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,250
management the biggest cheater in the
world

246
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,410
five thousand dollars a pop

247
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,339
and surveillance is telling me telling
them that are making legitimate pet

248
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,750
now years later when I wrote what I
wrote a book about this and I

249
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,540
the walls all this and how I did it they
were stunned the photo was

250
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,050
anything from I was clocking the wheel
or I had some kinda magnet underneath

251
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,430
it with but it was salts see kiss keep
it simple stupid it was so stupid

252
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,150
that all all you people who've never
played roulette although a handful that

253
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,550
I've never even been in a casino

254
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,839
could actually go out and do this today
right we don't go to the casino tonight

255
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,690
after this after this convention

256
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,400
with all the right now a.m. and so you
could be the first

257
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,550
50 for all technical picture I swear
that's how easy and super was

258
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,329
and now I'm gonna show you another clip
on the casinos reaction to it when I

259
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,800
finally told them what was happening and
don't forget they

260
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,709
I'm they want to arrest me more they
were they were after me like the

261
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,920
like everyone else was at the bin Laden
I was the bin Laden

262
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,920
casinos that's how bad they wanted me
okay thought let's take a look at this

263
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,620
that sounds exciting looks any

264
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,280
activity ohtake bill archer on

265
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,329
with cameras watching their every move
Marcus realize that to continue scamming

266
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,310
the casinos

267
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,339
he had to come up with the big idea

268
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,579
the solution was pure genius he turned
the constant surveillance to his

269
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,609
advantage

270
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,790
a simple reversal of the past posting
live made markets

271
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,120
Las Vegas legend it's all good

272
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,240
that anyone can go out and do it right
now

273
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,809
and it's it's indefensible Richards move
was brilliant

274
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:41,379
in the light that he put the big bet out
in advance

275
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,480
and disguised it for hit it from the
dealers field

276
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,449
I found the perfect angle how to place
the chips and buy a bike

277
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,559
are joining out red chips just by I'm
going at all of the the distance or

278
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,370
fingernail

279
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,930
that he had the five thousand dollar
chip on the navy's once we knew that

280
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,420
we have the basic makings of that move

281
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,329
the key to the new move was disguised
plus sleight-of-hand

282
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,670
the hardship was always on the table but
only revealed if the bet was one

283
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,500
markets named his name age the Savannah

284
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,480
after his favorite Vegas Strip the first
time I got page but since I was in all

285
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,960
caps

286
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,070
it was better than sex it was the
biggest high

287
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,760
of all time what we did as well we hit
the five thousand dollar ship on the

288
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,430
knees and the lost on the ball

289
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,140
still thinks there's fifteen or twenty
dollars there now the ball spinning

290
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,780
and phone it lands on all one in bed
it's either even money back or 21 best I

291
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,850
start screaming

292
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,250
I won five thousand dollars I won five
thousand dollars on the first column or

293
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,830
on the 1936 pet

294
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,810
now there is no idea what I'm talking
about this deal never saw the five

295
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,739
thousand dollars chip

296
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,290
underneath there what's hidden if the
best wins

297
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,130
you would call upstairs say was the bet
there and of course it was it was there

298
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,150
right from the beginning

299
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,390
with the bat confirmed by the camera

300
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,200
the casino had to pay half

301
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,900
but the real skill and pulling off the
Savannah came in at that was lost

302
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,590
and the high-value chips had to be
removed from the table before the crew

303
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,669
PA could break it in

304
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,850
the actual sheeting move only happens
when that

305
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:22,569
that loses and one that that loses I
just go out and I rake it right off

306
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,379
I want to do a common reading of the
chips and said hey sir put that down

307
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,630
but when I put down was not the five
thousand ten dollars I have out there

308
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,780
but the fifteen dollars that was in my
other hand the three red chips

309
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,840
but since the dealer never saw all the
five thousand dollar chip

310
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,220
and fought that the bet was fifteen
dollars he is satisfied that I put back

311
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,590
what was originally there over the next
four months

312
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,939
Marcus and his team scams an estimated
two million dollars

313
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,340
using the Savannah savannah is my family
cheating ruled the world because it's

314
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,909
just

315
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,560
just so much money okay that is an
example of taking

316
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,310
multi-million dollars worth of
surveillance high-tech

317
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,080
to a state-of-the-art equipment and
making it worse

318
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,850
a simple third-grade elementary for

319
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,740
completely course lack of the casinos
more money than it did to put this

320
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,930
the surveillance equipment in okay
really that that's how

321
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,930
ridiculous it was and that I love

322
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,220
priming and they chased me around Las
Vegas in the Russell world for years

323
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,870
trying to figure out what we were doing

324
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,750
okay all view all know about

325
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,300
RFID technology I know that um

326
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,379
in casinos it has it has to use is one
is

327
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,340
for keeping track of players every time
they put a chip on a table the

328
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,100
RFID chip within the chip tells the
casino how much this person is betting

329
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,730
and is this person is he worth comping
is he worth for free don't know what is

330
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,000
he worth to the casino

331
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,210
and that Mets 50 percent above while
RFID

332
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,250
RFID technology is in casinos

333
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,090
the other 50 percent is to protect
against cheating

334
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,280
are I'm gonna show you a clip for

335
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,639
and I relief this this clip is really
well known and it's a great

336
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,660
up it really specifies exactly

337
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,740
what r of ID does for casinos and then
after we see the clip

338
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,470
world that we're going to take a look at
how that that also gets be

339
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,600
quality

340
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,270
cleverness speed and savings these are
the features that make this system

341
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,480
standout

342
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,110
the CIS typologies system the inventory
of chips

343
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,800
RFID PJM represents a real revolution

344
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,139
it is a smart system endowed with
several elements

345
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,460
able to interact with each other I'll be
at a casino equipment

346
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,190
holds the license for this device
designed to link up several practical

347
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,440
casino systems

348
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,970
I'm applications patented in 84
countries

349
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,270
in a short period of time attests to the
interest on operators someplace

350
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,120
was recognized its usefulness the
starting point is the

351
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,500
RFID betting chips relationship this
report on and take someone you fall

352
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,750
s the beating heart is an advanced micro
chip

353
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,300
embedded inside the chest its exterior
is not different from

354
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,520
other traditional betting chips but
inside it contains all the features that

355
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,700
make it possible to identify it at all
times from a general monitoring system a

356
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,760
real DNA that makes it possible for
casinos to conduct a real time

357
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,480
monitoring

358
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,260
instant confirmation merger the position
and trajectory throughout the chips

359
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,310
existence

360
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,909
from the time the fitting rooms are
opened weekend virtually follow the

361
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,130
daily part of the

362
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,370
RFID microchip chips the embedded
microchip

363
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,790
makes it possible to continuously keep
an eye on the chips

364
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,740
from the polls to the cashier at the
start of the day and entry is taken off

365
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,410
the chips

366
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,570
stand they are taken after the balls
check

367
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,090
time handed over to the person in charge
of the betting areas cash test

368
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,879
carries out of this gesture I'm
automatic canceled the chips

369
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,000
thereafter the chips are divided up hun
given to the inspectors in the

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,590
appropriate quantities

371
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,970
so that these can reach the specific
RFID playing tables

372
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,770
equipped with tracking antennae the
first table with an

373
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,120
RFID device introduced to the public was
the blackjack table

374
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,909
it was a resounding success from the
time it first appeared in gambling

375
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,840
centers

376
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,730
the enthusiasm generated by this
innovative and prison system

377
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,550
encouraged caveat is Research Department
to conduct new studies

378
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,919
on find applications the poker tables as
well

379
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,620
no more errors on maximum plane's speed
with the smart

380
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,330
RFID chips the way it works is simple:

381
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,629
but it guarantees maximum security the
microchip transmits data to special

382
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,990
antennae at a very high frequency

383
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,380
interface with monitoring software
located on the tabletop portrays the

384
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,840
movements of the chips

385
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,949
guaranteeing accurate monitoring all the
game

386
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,880
it is part of an overall network
controlled by the main office

387
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,930
every individual device into tracks in
real time with the network

388
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,680
providing complete integrated monitoring

389
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,770
to better understand the advantages of
the system

390
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,860
let us observe it in action at a
blackjack table

391
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,620
equipped with RFID

392
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,649
tracking antennae capable of recognizing
I'm reading microchips

393
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,360
embedded in the chips are placed
underneath the layout on a traditional

394
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,199
table

395
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,680
the table has three sensitive areas
equipped with antennae

396
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,190
linked to software the three areas have
specific tasks

397
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,700
going from the center of the table on
extending to its age

398
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,890
there is a for sensitive area in front
of the croupier

399
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,380
the flow trade in the half moon space
between the croupier

400
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,300
on the play area is the working area
which is fundamental

401
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,540
its task is to track the chips arriving
on the table

402
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,050
either from the cash register supply of
those purchased directly from the table

403
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,320
by a better

404
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,159
finally in front of each better there
are six interactive secular areas

405
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,430
box which also connected thanks to the
special antennae

406
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,520
to software on the monitor a separate
from the table

407
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,560
that makes it possible to easily and
immediately

408
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,110
read the individual backs we will now
analyse the special antennae to

409
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,459
appreciate the sophistication of the
technology

410
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,580
the antennae cannot be seen from the
outside since they are located

411
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,689
underneath the tables layout they are
equipped with an extremely sophisticated

412
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,410
tracking system thanks to the antennae
dealers some players can monitor

413
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,430
everybody chair at any time in a totally
safe manner

414
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,900
maximum accuracy is assured when placed
on top of the sensitive area

415
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,990
the chips are identified and monitored
by antennae

416
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,290
all along the surface of the box both
horizontally and vertically

417
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,980
in this way the monitoring is also
guaranteed in special situations

418
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,270
such as when chips overlap are stacked
up to a maximum number of 20

419
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,440
let us now see how easily what I've been
describing

420
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,440
actually works of

421
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,980
style present on earth on the block him

422
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,850
whenever a bet on the table be counted
and post it notes that monitored by

423
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,370
from the RFID

424
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,439
very simple right

425
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,440
every four people right wrong

426
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,390
of okay that's very sexy tape I'm sure
somebody want to be in a bit but the

427
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,190
since my since my talk is already
shortened we gotta cut corners

428
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,710
okay now RFID sartre

429
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,430
focal fright I'm sitting at a blackjack
table

430
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,680
and I'm gonna bet fifty dollars okay

431
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,930
I put the chips down as soon as I put
the the RFID is activated and it shows

432
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,930
on the monitor that I bet fifty dollars

433
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,840
right anybody disagree with that not
okay now if I were to tell you

434
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,600
that I bet my fifty dollars and the
dealer

435
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,580
deals the hands and i win after the hand
winds

436
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,389
the dealer pays me fifty dollars I go
out

437
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,390
and I pick up my original fifty dollar
bet

438
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,470
and I switch in a thousand-dollar chip

439
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,240
with a twenty five dollar chip on
opposite so I i

440
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,910
take back my fifty dollars and I put
back one thousand and twenty five

441
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,690
dollars

442
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,650
and I call touch the dealer's hand and I
claim and I say hey you paid me wrong

443
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,660
I just better faust in twenty-five
dollars and you paid me

444
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,280
fifty dollars and soul says the RFID

445
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,310
monitor and I only by fifty dollars now
is there one person in this room

446
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,629
that believe that I'm not I'm just not
talking about a buncha crap

447
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,780
as a one person in the row in the room
that really believes

448
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,889
that I could do what I just said I did
that with the are for use all the size L

449
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,710
RFID monitors bigger than you

450
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:11,230
you saw right is there any way possible
with with the dealer here

451
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,930
species with you here the RFID monitor
here

452
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,950
and the supervisors in the pit is there
anyway I could claim

453
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,130
after the bet was after the hit was over
and they paid me

454
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,780
hey you made a mistake and I bet a
thousand twenty-five dollars

455
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,060
which I obviously didn't I bet fifty
dollars and inspire the RFID monitor

456
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,820
they pay me two thousand twenty five
dollars without even looking at the RFID

457
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,460
monitor

458
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,290
now how's that possible a way out
anybody have an idea how that's possible

459
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:46,100
well that's what I did

460
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,120
but what i'm saying is how did I get
away with it how can I

461
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,169
just cuz I switch the chips all they
have to do all normal up

462
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,170
but before that what i'm saying is

463
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,890
the on making the bed when I switch the
chips thousand-dollar chip that I put in

464
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,390
of course it has your fight

465
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,780
RFID call for a thousand dollars but I
made the bet after

466
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,600
its after its after the bout was made

467
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,149
because the the original on the monitor
chose my original fifty dollar bet

468
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,380
now the fact that I batting a 1000
twenty-five dollars

469
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,720
nullifies because I'm betting it after
how do I get away with it how do they

470
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,640
not look

471
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,920
added in the first place how do i how do
I get the casino not to look at the

472
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,450
monitor

473
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:40,340
I don't want to look at it because if
they look at it on that

474
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:47,340
somebody back there had an idea yes but
I'm SunCom

475
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,219
on computer store but I don't know how
to deactivate anything except my mouth

476
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,370
I'm here I'm here I'm here and I'm here
to talk about

477
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,219
ingenuity not technology cause I don't
know anything about technology

478
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,870
if I knew something about technology
Michael number would have invited me to

479
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,550
speak here

480
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:14,490
yes sir well that that's close

481
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,220
outflank us 1010 run into any more time
you off

482
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,600
its cool psychology it's called sup

483
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,030
setting them all so before I made that
move I'm going to the casino

484
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,170
I go to that very table and I'd bet for
real almost like you said

485
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,870
I'd bet for real a thousand in
twenty-five dollars for real what

486
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,879
thousand-dollar chip

487
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,420
were twenty five dollar chip on par for
real wanna lose wanna lose

488
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,510
I do it again because I know all for
every

489
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,970
thousand dollars I bet I'm only a one or
two percent this advantage so on the

490
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,460
long run we lose twenty dollars

491
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,590
so if I have to lose twenty dollars a
forty dollars to set them up

492
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,409
I do it so now I bet the fifty dollars
maybe there's another deal there are

493
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,220
there's another pit boss there or
whatever

494
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,840
and I switched after I win and I claimed
hey you pay me wrong

495
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,520
what happens they remember me

496
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,970
they remember me because I was already
at that table bedding

497
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,720
a thousand in twenty-five dollars like
I'm claiming I just bet now

498
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,630
but this time I didn't bet it I cheated
but the set them up

499
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,950
I bet legitimately a thousand
twenty-five dollars two or three times

500
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,630
however long it takes

501
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,170
that would be my decision based on how I
felt about the security situation in the

502
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,520
casino

503
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,920
and somebody somebody said something
about of who said something about the

504
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,020
fact that the

505
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,410
are for you did that sometimes it makes
mistakes now I don't really know

506
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,890
the frequency that RFID makes mistakes
like what is the probability that it

507
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,980
puts the wall that it puts the wrong

508
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,600
ship them out on on the monitor but
thats

509
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,699
instead of insulting me because I'm a
high roller that they already saw

510
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,430
don't even bother to look at the or
Friday because I set them up

511
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,560
I took them away from all the
surveillance equipment that they pay

512
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,440
have and thats more or less

513
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,360
simple now Senate the casino near here

514
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,649
family are anymore anyone wanna go
tonight with Michael nighter

515
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,670
to a casino on say see if any other
stuff really works

516
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:22,670
of K so

517
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:35,090
step

518
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,560
very good question you are you actually
telling me you with you and you are no

519
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,330
casino knowledge US that question

520
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,620
I my wife loses my money to but in a
diff in a different way

521
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,070
are she just feels from arm

522
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,240
the question the everybody have a
question

523
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,430
ok the question the question was is
because he the gentleman notice that

524
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,480
my type betting on putting the large
denomination

525
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,700
chip underneath a with the regular
follow

526
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,230
different denominations chips and he
asked to do most people bet that we do

527
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,550
the most people bet normally with the
same amount love

528
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,760
same core chips like for green chips or
five red chips and the answer is

529
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,690
you're correct most people bet uniformly
and they stay within their same caller

530
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,600
but most people it's seventy eighty
percent the casino simply cannot live

531
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,510
somebody bets

532
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,280
three different color chips hand
actually

533
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,660
the callers on the chips and everything
have nothing to do with it

534
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,600
a when I had the chips or on some moves
when I didn't hide the chips

535
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,159
you would think well how can he claim he
betta a thousand-dollar chip

536
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,620
with a 24-hour chip on top if they're
two completely different callers

537
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,229
calls have nothing to do it's the
psychology and the and the

538
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,240
1i claim pay you paid me wrong it's a
shock factor

539
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,220
I don't get too much into that cuz thats
but basically what what my point is here

540
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,430
is with a little ingenuity and
psychology

541
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,640
I was able to completely disable RFID

542
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,460
completely disable the eye in the sky
%uh the surveillance cameras

543
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,850
okay arm not say I want to talk about

544
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,459
is her arm has anybody here heard about
people using

545
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,300
our computers wearing computers on them
with their pieces or sometimes though

546
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,240
scanners in in cell phones lays laser
scanners and cell phones

547
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,410
to predict where roulette Paul's gonna
drop and try to clock that in and turn

548
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:31,980
the

549
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,080
manage to their side on blossom you
heard about that

550
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,470
okay well we're gonna take a love a
little video on that

551
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,340
and then we're going to see what that's
all about

552
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:51,340
this video is far less sexy than the
other one

553
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,630
now the person is wearing the computer

554
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,050
the ball spinning and the computer
supposed to tell 27

555
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,870
6

556
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,139
it also numbers are next to each other
on the wheel not not been warmly but

557
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,429
they're

558
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:15,540
on the wilderness pre-trial and the ball
lands on

559
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,909
what she's gonna show us 27 okay ok at
that time

560
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,569
supposedly it landed right on the number

561
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,890
sounds for fun good

562
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,918
so in the earpiece in the earpiece the
personal computers hearing your computer

563
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,810
was hauling them

564
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,230
for bed 62

565
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:40,699
24

566
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:45,199
I

567
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,509
okay it's number or a which is three or
four numbers away and I'll explain the

568
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,850
significance to that

569
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:58,610
away from the part numbers now

570
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:04,720
K

571
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,720
into 22

572
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,770
okay number nine so it's right next to
1822 sounds

573
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:31,150
care where computers from

574
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,120
this good basis just to give you an idea
what's happening

575
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Alka

576
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,270
I sounds

577
00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:00,270
on the way I have a feeling using my
coffin with the Miami

578
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,990
University 31 14 I

579
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:14,990
so again it's one of the year to call
your mom is OK okay

580
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,230
a this phenomenon has been going on in

581
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,450
in a casino world for about seven or
eight years now

582
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,910
and it was made really really popular in
2004 where

583
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,350
a group of people from Eastern Europe
1&2

584
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,150
the ritz casino in London now you know
if you've never been to London

585
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,340
or never been in a casino you know the
word ritz

586
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,390
it has to be one of those typical fancy
London casinos with a lot of high

587
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,040
rollers Arab sheikhs

588
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,440
a businessman from Japan in and three
Eastern Europeans walked into man and a

589
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,700
woman and they had laser cell phones and
they walked out a casino with

590
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,279
three million dollars and then the
casino try to block

591
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,670
the block the payment and then they try
to get them arrested but

592
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,070
at the end they got their money and a a

593
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,290
the casino opened do anything about it
and the

594
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,730
it created a a crazy using roulette

595
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,690
up computers in casinos now real quickly

596
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,780
I'm just gonna put something on tourists
to show you basically

597
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:31,120
how put the a document please basically
what what goes on what those a roulette

598
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,540
a computer until just read with rule
that fastly if you like

599
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,500
it's basically what it's about

600
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,790
is the the idea was to clock though

601
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,810
the wall malls around one way and the
wheel moves around the other way and

602
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,240
it's the clock the speeds

603
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,330
both and then gauge you have a you have
a

604
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:58,330
appoint like if this is the will appear
you clocked the revolutions and if

605
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,080
you're using the top for the wheel as a
reference point in every time the wall

606
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,040
balls around you

607
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,690
clot you have a clicker on your clicking
it and that's entering data into your

608
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,350
computer

609
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,680
and then when the ball falls of course
there's era depending on how a ball

610
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,490
bounces

611
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,709
but it's all built into it that if

612
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,210
when you bet straight up on a roll that
number pays 35 21

613
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,210
if you can this if you can get

614
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,380
let's say within a cell

615
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,580
if you can predict where the walls Milan
within say six numbers that are not

616
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,569
numerically similar in sequence but are
in sequence in the in their positions on

617
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,260
the wheel

618
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,350
if you can get within six numbers one in
three or even one in four times

619
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,520
you'll have a a significant advantage
all over the casino

620
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,540
and that's that's what that's how that
works

621
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,240
and %uh the are casinos for some reason
you

622
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,959
you will know more about this and I do
are having trouble detecting them

623
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,430
because the wall the interference while
the cell phones and all the other stuff

624
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,500
to all their own

625
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,200
video surveillance equipment they're
having trouble detecting

626
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,430
people with these computers and and in
the United States if anyone squat

627
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,330
and in a casino with a computer just on
them not even actively using if you walk

628
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,580
it through a casino

629
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,710
our Florida United States with with a

630
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,420
computer on your body that's in in the

631
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,260
and more ready to function it's a felony
just having it

632
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,500
it's a felony in the in las vegas casino
so they're really serious about it

633
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,500
up up while your cell phones the lasers

634
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,790
who hosts who said that yellow the
latest news in the cell phones the same

635
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,450
principle

636
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:47,450
another even know what Google less nah
nah nah nah nah it just sits just a a

637
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,590
cell phone is not

638
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,660
consider the

639
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,230
a equipment for I did hear a joke or who
said what

640
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,289
somebody says some funny all

641
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,890
of their well as far as I'm concerned
itself on the cell phone of

642
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,140
up know it's only the

643
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,799
it's called gaming a cheating and gaming
paraphernalia they call it a and a

644
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:14,660
computer strapped your body is
considered that a

645
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,770
cell phones in Google glass and although
you cannot wear glasses a

646
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,579
and a casino and you can't you can have
the cellphone

647
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,289
law if you're playing in the casino you
can't be on the cell phone at the table

648
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:33,900
in most casinos yes old and it's all
about money it's it's

649
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,760
it's the speed its clocking the speed of
the war on the spin the wheel on them

650
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,170
when you

651
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,480
one ball reaches a certain point it
starts to

652
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,609
the the speech starts the K and slows
down and then it falls

653
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,200
and the all apart on the computer also
takes into account

654
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,500
how the walls gonna bounce but that's
less accurate you can't clock the way

655
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,200
the walls gonna bounce a as

656
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,970
as accurately as you can the speed but
all polls all those elements combined

657
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,868
in most cases in in the in most of the

658
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:08,400
expensive computers these computers
could cost thirty to fifty thousand

659
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,240
dollars apiece as

660
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,549
people sell them online for like nothing
but they don't really work

661
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:17,589
yes you can I'm sure a lot of people
here have the know-how to

662
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:21,099
to do this all I like I said anyone
wanna go to the casino after show all

663
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:25,210
are I like to make a little money out of
the still saw

664
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,190
are what %uh

665
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,500
so if you're going to get involved I'll
do whatever you want okay all

666
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,609
up

667
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:43,788
not you what you make the bet at the
last possible minute because

668
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:48,059
at a certain won the war starts to slow
down to your computer is giving you the

669
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:48,819
information

670
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:54,369
yes yes your but at some point the deal
was going to say no more bets

671
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:58,460
but it's usually right before the ball
falls obviously

672
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,510
the long or the deal or allows the
betting

673
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,020
to go on and and the closest you can bet

674
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,288
to the point where both love for the
Lord manager gonna have

675
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:12,740
for for dealer waves of the bets very
early one just like two or three more

676
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,490
for revolutions the goal

677
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,450
then you're no matter how good your
computer is it's not going to be that

678
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,098
profitable but if the deal lets though
you know let it slow down and doesn't

679
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,480
and Sloan slow and just before the ball
drops no more bats

680
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,980
then you can obtain advantage okay

681
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,890
arm let's move on to has anybody

682
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,520
in 2006 II gotta

683
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,788
I got a call from producers from the CBS
show 60 minutes

684
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:45,089

690
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:15,900
that's

691
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,029
thats though elementary scan now that's

692
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:22,640
that was even before when talking about
this this was a scam where

693
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,440
if anyone is familiar with online gaming
here we have what we just you don't even

694
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,619
have to be just poker

695
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:31,160
is there anyone in this room who's never
played a hand the poker I won't believe

696
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,589
hands gonna go up even a woman's head

697
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:38,740
I saw two hands go up I'm I'm
flabbergasted i

698
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,209
so you never play to help open life were
what country are you from

699
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,270
nice day America

700
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,420
okay

701
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,529
of I thought I see it all I

702
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:57,470
okay months or I'm not

703
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,618
of all in poker obviously is you get

704
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:06,049
cards face down and you get cart and
cards face up everybody sees and your

705
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:06,788
parts

706
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:11,049
face-down store ace in the hole your
that expression ace in the hole

707
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:15,750
cause it in the hole means you can't see
it okay so in all poker games

708
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,900
or the you usually have work the the big
day now is called Texas style you have

709
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,650
two cards face down

710
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,390
and it works the same way on online but
what happened is

711
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:30,240
one person the or people have started to

712
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,169
or bypass the security called are the
providers of the online site

714
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,779
your opponents whole courts and this
created a mega scam that was

715
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,890

that but before before getting to that

716

726
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,349
popper and it's just so happened that I

730
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,049
a you know a segment by them on the
subject

732
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:43,440
and of course you can't do anything live
live on 60 minutes goes to show was

733
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,180
taped

734
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,490
by said how about we come in there and
we hack into an online

735
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,020
a poker game session how would you like
that and their immediate reaction was

736
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,410
wow world we're gonna have a hundred
million viewers

737
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,710
that was our immediate reaction then
they fought about it and they thought

738
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,880
about it and they

739
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,299
realize that they would be involved in
the commission of a crime

740
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:08,520
and and her and at the time

741
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,880
up it was the Steve craft

742
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,460
who you know she here and some

743
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,970
a about the woman's name already the but
it was

744
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,759
the they were very excited about it and
then decided they didn't want to do it

745
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,670
on because its got too many legal
implications

746
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,559
and maybe somebody maybe somebody to
within thereof

747
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,710
organization was skeptical skeptical
about the

748
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,730
validity of what I was talking about saw
it

749
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:44,420
one away and then in the 2007 and 2008

750
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:51,420
wanna show you now happened CVS what

751
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,000
in the wild wild west with a poker
player was caught cheating

752
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,069
it was a capital offense with the
punishment quickly dispense right across

753
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:04,500
the card table

754
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,000
but today if you're caught cheating and
the popular and lucrative world

755
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,079
internet poker you may get away
scot-free

756
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,150
at least that seems to be what's
happening in the biggest scandal

757
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,119
in the history of online gambling small
group of people manage to cheat players

758
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,250
out of more than twenty million dollars
and it would have gone

759
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,700
undetected if it hadn't been for the
players themselves

760
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,939
we use the internet to root out the
corruption is a joint investigation by

761
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,849
sixty minutes

762
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:34,549
in the washington post reveals it raises
new questions

763
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:39,630
about the integrity and security at the
shot away a highly profitable business

764
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,720
operates outside US law

765
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,379
money-maker put his name amongst the
greatest players in the game

766
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,630
if you had to pick the moment that the
poker boom began

767
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,759
it was probably the day and unknown
account names Chris Moneymaker

768
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:59,750
12.5 million dollars at the 2003 World
Series of Poker

769
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,599
suddenly every amateur with the hack
sunglasses and a stack of chips

770
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:07,650
saw themselves is the next big
moneymaker

771
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,230
nearly 7,000 people competed in this
year's tournament

772
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,970
for a hundred eighty million dollars in
prize money to fever

773
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,368
the spread far beyond Las Vegas it is
the richest sporting competition in the

774
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,049
world

775
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:24,690
and yet all this pales in comparison the
half a million people who are playing on

776
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,420
the Internet right now

777
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,450
in the unregulated world online poker 50
me as we learned in this tutorial all

778
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,109
you have to do to play is log on to the
World Wide Web

779
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:38,270
click your way onto an online gambling
site

780
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,640
open an account with your credit card
choose your game

781
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,589
and pull up a seat at a virtual table
thought that these people could be five

782
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,400
from anywhere in the world

783
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,599
I could be you here in the united states
I could be in India they could be a

784
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,170
South Africa we should tell you that
this $18 billion dollar industry is a

785
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,779
legal in the US

786
00:48:56,779 --> 00:49:00,920
a ban is almost impossible to enforce
sense the internet sites

787
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,500
and the computers to randomly deal the
cards and keep track of the bats

788
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,369
are located offshore beyond the
jurisdiction of US law enforcement

789
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:14,759
and unlike land-based casinos there is
almost no official regulation

790
00:49:14,759 --> 00:49:20,089
enforcement or supervision but it hasn't
stopped thousands of mostly young man

791
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,349
from making this their livelihood

792
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:26,190
hot would tell us a former computer
scientist term poker pro

793
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:30,270
says you no longer have to go to Vegas
to finalize takes me a scientist at your

794
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,730
local calling room

795
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,410
got to get dressed inoculating you just
a is right there on your computer

796
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,899
what Alice says online poker is much
different faster

797
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,339
more aggressive and less personal that
look at some places across table you're

798
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:44,369
just

799
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:48,049
plan the cards that come blow to the
computer not only are you

800
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:51,200
not looking at your opponents you're not
looking at

801
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,359
the cards being del you're looking at
who's dealing them to you

802
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:58,328
so you don't know if the the whole thing
is legit and even if all the players

803
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,130
sitting with you

804
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,750
are just as legitimate as your in the
whole game isn't and is what Alice found

805
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,059
out it wasn't

806
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:07,640
at least on a popular internet site
called Absolute Poker

807
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,058
his suspicions were first two rows in a
high-stakes game

808
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:14,599
have texas holdem against what he
thought was an incompetent

809
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:17,759
am lucky amateur using the screen name
gray cat

810
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:21,200
this gray cat person was new and at
first he seem like a live one

811
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,710
he seem terrible he seemed to play crazy
it seem like he was giving us money away

812
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,400
is that the only thing was he was losing
he was playing in a style that was sure

813
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,710
to lose

814
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,540
but he was telling the game day after
day while what else was losing fifteen

815
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,890
thousand dollars I'm gonna pick up this
part

816
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,930
focusing on much time left I want to
cover one one more thing and and

817
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:43,290
for what happened here is a buncha a
buncha people

818
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,740
very intelligent people a lot of them in
the

819
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,790
as you heard a lot of them computer
people were also hot there seems to be a

820
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,640
relationship between high-stakes

821
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,910
online poker players and the computer
people

822
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,560
obviously here as far as we know it that
that correlation does not exist by any

823
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,779
way of

824
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,560
unusual for the for men over there
churchyard

825
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,810
anyway lemme so what happened was they
will

826
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,330
of somebody in the room mention
something about tracking

827
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,720
thing was over here somewhere about
tracking hands and all that and %uh

828
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,120
that's what they did they were tracking
these hints and they were seeing that a

829
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,500
guy I was playing

830
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,870
terribly because on you can buy that you
can buy the program's or or write your

831
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:28,040
own software to just keep track of every
hand every card and you can go back and

832
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,470
run

833
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,990
you can run back the last twenty
thousand hands at a particular gain your

834
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,000
particular or

835
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,070
site and they were finding out that
these guys are just plain terrible but

836
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:37,980
they kept winning

837
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,040
and by plantar wart just signing going
against well the normal

838
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,230
moves that are usually made in a poker
game and flu that they found out

839
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,490
a they traced it to or

868
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,140
morning with the details on that and
about the morning

869
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,879
Erica the alleged heist was
extraordinary brazen

870
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,950
and simple back into the security
cameras take a peek at the tables

871
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,160
and poss the information took gambler
easy

872
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,430
it's a scene that could have been ripped
right out at the movies whether its

873
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,339
oceans 11

874
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:56,600
10 comforts you or lock stock and Two
Smoking Barrels

875
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:02,060
gotcha just like those films Australia's
biggest casino has been hit by what

876
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,000
appears to be

877
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,060
a classic staying a high road in custom
01 at least

878
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:11,230
32 million dollars after an accomplice
allegedly tapped into the casino

879
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,800
security systems

880
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,370
according to the casino the helper
hacked into the security cameras

881
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,400
and followed the action on the tables
then used in

882
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,460
earpiece to let the gambler no how to
places bets

883
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,690
the problem with casinos is that they
believe they're unbeatable

884
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,730
and we see over and over again that
they're not

885
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,220
the client has been banned in one member
of the casino staff has lost his job

886
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:37,560
the Crown Casino is a favorite celebrity
hangout Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes one

887
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,259
state here

888
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:43,150
at now it's facing a new hollywood twist
but for all the wrong reasons

889
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:48,110
Erica casinos really don't like to talk
about this kinda breach in security

890
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,270
it's bad publicity okay what's what's
wrong with that

891
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,910
is anyone notice anything wrong with
that they're saying that somebody hacked

892
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,569
into the

893
00:54:55,570 --> 00:55:00,240
the casino surveillance video equipment
and use that advantage

894
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,689
use that knowledge to somehow when
thirty million dollars

895
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:08,120
what's wrong with that

896
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,250
ok there it is what did they say

897
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:17,240
what is a a video camera of a video
camera all they do is film what happened

898
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,500
not what's going to happen

899
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,090
saw what what i don't understand is and
I'm sorry so this is not a test

900
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,240
I will understand it how's it possible
that

901
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,399
if you watch the video surveillance
what's going on a casino

902
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,620
in the past how does that how do you
want thirty million dollars

903
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,359
so the I'm wondering is there something
there's gotta be something more to this

904
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,850
that maybe some love you folks the can
enlighten me about Chris

905
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:49,190
I think I think this is all ball I think
just more florid

906
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:53,170
