1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,269
so is when he says

2
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,340
once upon a time I

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,570
was a Linex security guy and

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,760
and 2010 I was invited to give a talk
very much like this one on Windows seven

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,000
security from

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,140
a UNIX perspective as I had this unique
perspective having done both

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,220
on in that talk I basically compared the

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,129
security features I have windows and
various

9
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:42,019
Nix systems and show that Windows had
matched or surpassed

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,379
the security techniques that the
community had developed and so you could

11
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:45,860
say that

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,510
when 07 was just fine for a prudent user
to go access the Internet

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,140
I but for non-technical users

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,890
I your family you have to tell them to
be careful

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,309
what they click on you get this advice
all the time be careful what you click

16
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:02,779
on

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,390
you know you might get an email with
some nasty links in a but

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,729
that started to create problems

19
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,580
the attackers got better they noticed
that sa for exploitation had become

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,350
difficult

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,949
and so they resort to social engineering
to coerce you into clicking on something

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,069
I

23
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:27,950
worse a a users got more demanding that
they wanted appliances that they just

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,640
can use without thinking about it and so
I

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,220
it's no longer acceptable I

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,670
or effective to tell users to be careful

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,979
that just doesn't work anymore and so
this talk

28
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,069
is about how Windows a raises the bar

29
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:51,319
on this and a whole bunch of other
problems as our agenda

30
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,060
gonna start with the TCB and move up
through the stack

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,110
so first

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,840
you gotta sees the high ground way down
at the bottom UEFI

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,789
is sort of the next step in evolution a
BIOS

34
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,958
but it's a big step so they gave it a
new name it's not a Microsoft thing it's

35
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,440
a

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,829
industry consortia standards thing that
Microsoft participates in

37
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,690
I some key functional benefits are that
it's no longer just

38
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,209
Intel chips only it works with its
architecture independent so you can use

39
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,310
UEFI on ARM systems

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,079
its key security benefit is that it
enables

41
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,810
secure boot which will go into I

42
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,129
and it's a requirement to be a 00 a.m.
harbor certified

43
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:45,420
Windows 8 PC so

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,879
the old system I the BIOS we're just
going boo

45
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,599
whatever you told it to you so if an
attacker can get administrative control

46
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,959
over a PC in any operating system they
just replace the master boot record in

47
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,719
the BIOS goes well I guess this thing is
what I should be

48
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,010
never mind what DDS I

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,040
with UEFI now the

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,780
firmware can enforce that it will only
boots stuff

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,189
that is signed by a certificate that the
UEFI firmware trusts

52
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,170
so now it the attacker can just blanket
go

53
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:28,170
replace the operating system with
whatever nasty now where they want so

54
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,219
what you advise enforcing

55
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,700
is that the firmware the drivers I and
the loaders all have to be trusted

56
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,849
I E signed by the right certificate I

57
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,749
the UEFI database lists the undressed
the trusted he's so that he knows what

58
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:44,180
it is

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,310
should trust it supports a secure
rollback features so

60
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,200
users can say you know I didn't like
that hardware update made by Massey not

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,619
work

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,879
but it won't let you roll back past a
security update

63
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,388
the got some remediation features in it
so that it can

64
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,109
heal itself if it has a problem and

65
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,739
UEFI is now updated with Windows Update

66
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,819
Windows Update has this very robust
infrastructure for distributing updates

67
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,819
to everybody

68
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,339
the the second Tuesday thing so now we
can roll out

69
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:24,020
UEFI updates in a secure way to the
machines in

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,409
sort of adjacent to you UEFI is the TPM
chip

71
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,080
which you can think I've as being kind
of like a smart card embedded in your PC

72
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,620
it's a great place to store secrets
buried so deep that even the operating

73
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,400
system can't get them

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,030
so if your PC gets hacked your private
keys aren't disclosed

75
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,419
by it provide services so your operating
system can

76
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,229
use those certificates to authenticate
various services that wanna know that

77
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,840
you is you the TCG standard

78
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,690
say we call a TPM 2.00 TCG calls it EZ
GT p.m. next

79
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,300
when is a TPM support a

80
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,979
support for both discrete TPM and
firmware TPM switches

81
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,590
TPM functionality without the physical
security

82
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,758
so it's not as tamper-resistant STPM
normally is

83
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,979
and this is a logo requirement for
Windows 8 PCs that wanna be what's

84
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:25,330
called

85
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,840
instant go qualified that means that
it's

86
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,840
always on always connected in fetching
mail even while to sleep and where your

87
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,698
phone does

88
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,039
so having building built in all that
secure hardware

89
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,280
we can now get to the good stuff where
you can actually do a secure boot

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,179
I trusted boot means only boot signed
operating systems

91
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,889
this provides you and UN protection that
the thing you're actually booting is the

92
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,940
operating system you intended

93
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,599
for us its windows for other vendors it
can be any operating system within

94
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,860
lock it into just windows

95
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,660
it insures and prevents a resist
compromise OS is booting

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,759
I it prevents software from starting
before your anti-virus because then it

97
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,580
could disable the anti-virus

98
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,060
that's a program called %um early launch
something

99
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,639
early launch an email our I so that the
malware can get in there first and

100
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,720
and take control before in the malware
tries to

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,699
measured boot related is

102
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,620
attesting remotely that you have in fact
booted a trusted operating system

103
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,210
because it's very nice that you know you
put in it

104
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,378
clean OS how does a server over there
like

105
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:46,729
your bank know that you politically no
es

106
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,969
so here's the trusted boot process in
comparison

107
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,629
I before UF I

108
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,699
current generation the virus would do
whatever malware

109
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,819
and then Lord whatever drivers more
malware

110
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,870
so you don't really know what your
building

111
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,539
and now UEFI insurers

112
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,860
that you are museum

113
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,340
here it is that

114
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,789
your booting trusted operating system
loader

115
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:23,740
trusted anti-malware product trusted
third-party developers get you all the

116
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,729
way to Windows logon

117
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:32,729
be that that stuff is not an hour it's
in fact the intended operating system

118
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,989
measured booty the old thing would

119
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,970
measure the BIOS measure the master boot
record measure the OS loader

120
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,449
and then the kernel starts up in its
whatever colonel okay

121
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,509
we still don't know what operating
system running

122
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:54,039
Windows 8 measures the kernel the
drivers and the anti-malware software

123
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,889
the so that

124
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,430
you can have though a remote server can
have much more trust in what you're

125
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,080
running

126
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,330
so here's the animation and how it all
works you boot up

127
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,359
the secure boot prevents malware from
loading your OS

128
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,379
the anti-malware software is loaded
before

129
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,610
anything else so that your day
anti-virus stuff is working

130
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,099
a measurement all this stuff happens in
the TPM and so now we know that we're

131
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,509
building the right thing

132
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,659
now your plan goes in attempts to access
some server in the server says

133
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,000
I only talk to healthy PC is cough up
your certificate

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,260
okay so it goes back to the TPM achieves
the

135
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,700
s signed measurement what you booted

136
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,010
hands that too remote at a station
service that says yup

137
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,540
you did a good thing and hands that back
to the service you are trying to access

138
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,160
that goes

139
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,030
okay you're running on a real operating
system that we trust

140
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:06,400
now who are you

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,150
so moving further up the stack
protecting sensitive data

142
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,140
I encryption

143
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,720
drive encryption we are trying to make
it go mainstream

144
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,670
there's a traditionally it's only on
enterprise machines where people get

145
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,010
really hypertens about stolen data
because a

146
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,860
SB 1386 oh my god 50,000 customer
records were stolen and now it's in the

147
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,110
wall street journal

148
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,180
well that's tragic for that corporation
but when you're facebook password get

149
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,500
stolen bad things happen to you

150
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,360
so you want it to be pervasive it's good
to have your devices encryption

151
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,760
pervasively but there are problems
because TPM is in pervasive that the

152
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,530
the trick to drive encryption is where
you put the key

153
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:03,530
so we turned inbred device encryption on
by default

154
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,430
anything's I and we can do that

155
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,520
because they're almost all connected to
their Microsoft account

156
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,650
your cloud account and we do that we put
the drive recovery key

157
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,069
into your SkyDrive so when something
happens and you need to get your box

158
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,240
back

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,840
the goes through this dance with you in
your cell phone in your SkyDrive account

160
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,720
to get your recovery key backs a little
unlock your drive

161
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,250
that may allows you to have pervasive
encryption on consumer devices because

162
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,060
if

163
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,790
oh so sad you lost your password we
won't let you have your data back is not

164
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,140
acceptable to consumers

165
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,160
we need to have a reliable place to put
your here drive key

166
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,579
there is also secure enough to protect
the device so

167
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,650
drive key in SkyDrive is good enough for

168
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,069
boobs I left this in a taxi because the
guy who steals it at the taxi

169
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,280
doesn't know what account I have he
doesn't have access to that account so

170
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,569
he can't recover the data all we can do
is

171
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,420
take the device classic enterprise
encryption on the other hand

172
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,890
all now we're talking about really
valuable data and the victim

173
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,960
you know vice president of R&D might be
subject to spear phishing attack where

174
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,040
a professional thief is following him
around watching and Chaddha

175
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,120
people at a conference and when he turns
it back for a moment next the PC

176
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,530
meanwhile he's already if at the he was
already in SkyDrive

177
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,900
they might have already compromised to
SkyDrive account to and then they can

178
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,300
get

179
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,459
the plans for the next boeing airplane
or whatever

180
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,440
but by putting the drive key in AD
instead in SkyDrive now it's under any

181
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,880
price controls so

182
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,180
that attack doesn't work so putting the
key

183
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,410
into SkyDrive good for consumers putting
the key in your

184
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:01,870
Enterprise Asset Management Good for
Enterprise

185
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,870
this is what I worked on is making it
safe to click

186
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,750
first-round explain this notion user
confidence what's the security boundary

187
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,710
that we're trying to protect

188
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,640
we want and users to have the experience
that they are confident

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,569
in their PC that they can try and buy

190
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,520
and discard as many Windows Store app
says they want

191
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,319
I and if you don't like what the app is
doing to you you uninstall it and you

192
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,040
get your PC back

193
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,069
it doesn't prevent everything like it
doesn't prevent denial of service

194
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,630
if an app uses up all your disk space
uninstall it you get your disk space

195
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,390
back

196
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,630
if it's hard in your CPU don't running

197
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,930
so within reasonable bounds you
uninstall you get your PC back

198
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,079
typical user should never have had a bad
thing happen to them personally

199
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,240
they should not have any friends about
bad things happen to them either

200
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,450
they might have read about something bad
to happen in the newspaper somewhere

201
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:11,450
so it's not that it never happens it's
just that it should happen rarely

202
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,470
me achieve this through the App Store on
morning we actually curate the absolute

203
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,160
king for

204
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,670
malware in voller abilities and
craziness and we have a killed it

205
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,160
so that if an app is discovered to be
malicious we can

206
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,300
kill it worldwide on everybody's PC
everywhere within about a day

207
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,609
so even if now where makes into the
store if it does anything

208
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,200
obviously malicious it doesn't live long
and with the Apple Windows 8 app

209
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,000
container that's what I actually work
done

210
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,090
so what happened here

211
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,070
does in addition to that ap on-boarding
process

212
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,190
is that the App Store sandboxed I

213
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,770
so they're restricted they don't have
the full authority the user they don't

214
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,250
get to mess with the operating system

215
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,390
and they get some control access to
other app social show

216
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,280
so it is secure by default

217
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,400
that's a fundamental security property
that

218
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,930
the professors in here at least
recognize that if you wanna sound

219
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,000
security barrier it has to be secured by
default and what we did there

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,160
as we change the kernel that it says are
you an app container

221
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,480
0 well then the answer your access
request is no

222
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,040
unless there's some marks on that ACL
that's a yes we should allow access to

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,900
apt containers

224
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,680
so this allowed us to have a confident
conviction that

225
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,209
the Windows operating system is not
going to be Tampa by ap containers

226
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,280
except for the part where we turned it
on and said okay are you get that

227
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,280
and that and that that only really has
full access to its

228
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,880
own app for keeping it isolated from
other APs it gets access to

229
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,430
files let users want to use aP's on
their files right

230
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,800
so you need to give the app access to

231
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,469
any file but not every file and you want
to be under user control

232
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,180
so the way it works is the app says hey
I need to file you

233
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,099
the system says no just a second i'll be
right back I'm you ask the user about

234
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,440
that

235
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,500
the file picture comes up

236
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,220
and the user drives the file picker to
select the file

237
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,210
hits okay or cancel why would Angry
Birds be asking for files

238
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,810
he a and so in the user says okay then
the system returns a filehandle to the

239
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:45,810
app so here's my demo

240
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:03,989
18 issues next thing what you can see me

241
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,470
so this is modern ap notepad taker

242
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,470
the what you see here is not the app

243
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,910
that's the system file picker so now I
can go

244
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,839
save my thing here

245
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,279
so the app got to save a file

246
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,290
into my user folders without having
actually having access to the user

247
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:51,290
folders

248
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:28,939
work for you

249
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,570
area so some interesting properties here

250
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,039
that there was no user Act No

251
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,169
ap access to files granted unless the
user said so

252
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,450
there was also no mother may i

253
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,860
should I just do the thing you told me
to do you can send prompt that

254
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,149
annoys users a lot a

255
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,459
we hid that inside the choose dialogue
of

256
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,309
not 00 should I go access the file that
you just told the app to access its

257
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:18,649
which file would you like to grant to
this app there you go

258
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:23,049
we call this an authentic user gesture
because only the app the

259
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:28,889
user can do it the app cannot I N A U G
is useful in any scenario where you want

260
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:31,979
the user to have control over something

261
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,130
in this privilege domain that the Sammy
trusted entity over in that privilege to

262
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,330
main shouldn't have

263
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,299
and we use this widely in Windows 8

264
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,418
now to allow users to use their apt to
do

265
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,240
anything but not allow the app's to do
everything I

266
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,299
similarly a share

267
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:02,299
their share contracts in Windows let me
do that

268
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,530
so chocolate clearly something my wife
needs to know about

269
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,730
so I kick share

270
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,090
male and that their

271
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,970
is an A U G the app doesn't have access
to my Malay

272
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,330
the app just said I have something to
share i click the SHARE button again the

273
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,580
system lets me choose what happened I
want to share it with and I'm sharing it

274
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,120
with

275
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,120
my wife and it sends it

276
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:05,790
and I have had nothing to do with it

277
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,649
so again this year charm is another Auge

278
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:34,350
this lets I aP's arbitrarily share stuff
with any other app you want

279
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,299
but not under ap control it's under user
control so that's why

280
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,639
described this as being like pipes for
real users

281
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,689
it doesn't you don't have to understand
geometry in Unix command lines to

282
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:52,690
take naps and compose them together we
want it to be safe to browse

283
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,950
clicking should not be dangerous a

284
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,950
so we added the SmartScreen phishing
filter this came in and windows 7i e8

285
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,830
a in and what they were looking for was
phishing sites their short-lived they

286
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,539
pop up quickly so you need a very rapid
mechanism to propagate that this is a

287
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,600
dangerous website

288
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,289
cuz it's probably gonna live for about
12 hours %ah

289
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:21,730
it has about 500 million customers

290
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,450
fourteen billion request today because
what it's doing is every time

291
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,200
I E visits any URL as long as you opted
into this program

292
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,639
it transmits the URL to Microsoft
servers that go

293
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:39,709
yup that was not on the bad list so it's
going to get a lot of traffic

294
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,630
and so far as issued something like two
hundred million

295
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:50,100
fishing morning since inception I E 10

296
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,010
a added enhanced protection mode this is
a

297
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,620
I E seven was the first browser to come
with a browsing sandbox

298
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,469
where the web page that you see is
running in a lower privilege process

299
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,940
then the entire browser that has all the
chrome in the buttons on the stuff

300
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,210
that was built on top

301
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:15,169
obvious is low I'll feature so
sandboxing stuff going back to 2006

302
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,409
I A ten upped the ante

303
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:23,460
the EPAM enhanced protection mode is
that same sort of browsers and boxing

304
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,510
thing but this time

305
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,730
built on top about container so

306
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,990
in the modern browser the one in the new
you ax

307
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,690
8 p.m. is on by default and I A 11
coming in Windows 8.1

308
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,720
EPAM is on by default everywhere so even
on the classic desktop you get the

309
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,710
stronger sandbox

310
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,950
anyone to be safe to download

311
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,840
so smart screen got smarter I E nine

312
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,809
by on Windows seven added to download
reputation checker where if you download

313
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:55,570
something

314
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,809
I E would check summit and send that

315
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:04,908
up to the cloud and see whether it's
malware not and Windows 8 night and

316
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,490
added that check into the shell

317
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,870
so that if you download stuff

318
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,178
any which way that you get the smart
screen protection

319
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:17,120
and any which way has little caveat that

320
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,289
whatever app you use to download the
thing has to call a feature called

321
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:26,049
ATS attachment execution service yeah we
picked the name before the crib dust and

322
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:26,779
it came along

323
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,460
I and

324
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,070
it puts up booties on the file called
market the web

325
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,980
and the shell knows that women that
market the web is on file

326
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,559
a that's kinda suspicious we should do
something about that and with respect to

327
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,710
smart screen what it does is checks on
it

328
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,260
and send it back up to the cloud say is
this okay and of course it uses cashing

329
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,919
it doesn't always send it back up to the
cloud it sends out the cloud the caches

330
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:53,169
in

331
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,439
doesn't have it I and

332
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,340
so in this way even if your mom

333
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,830
got trolled by one of those vague AV web
sites that says oh my god you're so

334
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,899
infected

335
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:10,600
only $29.95 clean your PC here pay a I

336
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,570
that the SmartScreen things stop that
keep your mom out of trouble be

337
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,360
they issue about two million malware
warnings today

338
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,360
to billion morning since its inception
so heartening absence exploitation

339
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,760
all that stuff was I just making sure
that in ill behaved ap whether it's

340
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,549
malware or infected or whatever doesn't

341
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:48,110
hurry too bad this is about keeping good
option going bad

342
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,080
there's this broad long-term trend that
attackers are moving from

343
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,360
attacking the operating system to
attacking applications

344
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,539
because it's easier because that's where
the money is

345
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,000
therefore it's incumbent on the platform
to help the app stay safe

346
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,309
from the app's on bugs in 2002

347
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:12,029
I Windows surprising was the first to
deploy stack canaries in a widespread

348
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,220
way

349
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,899
my little company was shipping a Linux
OS that had why

350
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:21,070
carries throughout but that was a teeny
little minority destroying it was about

351
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,189
34

352
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:27,119
five years later that major Linux
distros caught up with that

353
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,459
so when it was first with protecting
aP's against stack overflows

354
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,789
windows was first with tassel are in Gap

355
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:39,450
not first in the universe but first in
the commodity operating system space

356
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,659
I and Windows 8 has added I heap
randomization so

357
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,570
make the heap jiggle to make it hard to
hit with your memory corruption attacks

358
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,799
and high entropy ASLR

359
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,869
so that it's really hard to hit those
randomized things

360
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:59,899
that's only on 64 bit because you need
the address space to make things move in

361
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:03,918
wide ways

362
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,610
and all these defenses are on by default
in the store

363
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,189
they're all previously often so you had
to go and convince

364
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,750
software vendors to opt into these
enhanced protections on Windows

365
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,629
in the store because it's a new platform
there was no app compatibility to live

366
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:21,658
up to

367
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,909
so we just turned on by default if your
app is incompatible with that then well

368
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:28,279
gosh it's not gonna work in the Windows
8

369
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,669
App Store market is it so justly those
things turned on we turn them on for you

370
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:33,480
anyway in there

371
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,000
I D E so you have to work at it turn off

372
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,419
so as a result a Windows Store app is
unlikely to be malicious because it on

373
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,000
boarding in the killed it

374
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,159
it's unlikely to be able to do anything
malicious to you because the app

375
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,769
container in the authentic user gestures

376
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,570
and now it's unlikely even be
exploitable because all these

377
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,408
protections are turned on

378
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,549
and so users have good reason to be
confident

379
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,379
that they can just use toppin stuff in
the modern environment and it won't hurt

380
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:04,969
them

381
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,309
and finally modernized access control

382
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:12,840
the fifth immutable love security that
we weak passwords

383
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,908
Trump strong security last year Mac
phone in had this lovely article

384
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:23,740
I in wired about how he had a cascading
string of failures with someone

385
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,299
phoning his passwords in various social
accounts taking one after another

386
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:33,000
and he lost all his pictures in all his
day and it was terrible

387
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,460
and is thesis is password sup

388
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,710
is right they do there's and therefore a
need to have something stronger than

389
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,149
passwords

390
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:47,689
and if you're an enterprise with lots of
money you can use fancy smart card

391
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,909
tokens

392
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:53,080
but now Windows has support for what we
call virtual smart cards

393
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,350
which basically turn your PC into your
smart card

394
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,830
so you have to have the pin code for the
virtual smart card and this

395
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,779
PC not that easy not that easy this one

396
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:13,429
effectively turning the PC into to
affect

397
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,419
we have new sign in options for touch
machines that

398
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,820
make it easier to use and this table
here

399
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,840
is showing the amount of entropy in

400
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,750
pin codes passwords and picture
passwords

401
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,980
and are you okay you can complain about
the entropy a pin codes

402
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,010
but it also has a lockout feature the
only yet

403
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,049
are small handful tries before the
machine locks you out

404
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:46,629
the key here is that I password cracking
doesn't work

405
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,908
if you don't have an offline attack
against the passwords

406
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:53,809
if you're only way to try passwords is
with your fingers on this PC and its

407
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:56,599
implementing a locker policy on you then
cracking

408
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:03,599
is going to fail so here's my stand

409
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:18,029
and machines locked games

410
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:29,590
come on

411
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:44,030
well it's not going to work screen
resolution is big enough

412
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,290
that was me lying in the PIN code

413
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,610
the point is that I don't care if you
shoulder sir

414
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,949
me because you have to steal this PC

415
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:05,110
as the picture password and PIN code
aren't roams to other PCs they're only

416
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,800
on this one

417
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:12,800
again that makes the PC effectively to
FAA

418
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,350
so biometrics I you may have seen in

419
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,010
I and business-oriented PCs the
fingerprint readers and they're kinda

420
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,790
flaky

421
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,500
and they're not universal and would be
nice if you could just

422
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,650
open the machine by thumping in with
your exam and that's the opportunity

423
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,660
that's coming

424
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,180
that fingerprint reader adoption is
going up fast among hardware vendors

425
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,520
in and our goal in Windows 8.1 is to
make this available everywhere

426
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,500
a the technology choices are getting
richer

427
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,600
the

428
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,980
readers are getting smarter the old ones
were just like a photocopier they were

429
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,450
looking for ridge's they could see in
the new ones use a combination of

430
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,650
thermals and ultrasound and capacitive
touch

431
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:22,120
they allow you to you authenticate my
just placing your finger on to the pad

432
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,310
instead of having to swipe it at just
the right

433
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,360
rate there is is

434
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,330
incident nevermind a

435
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,080
so the they need to be touching easy to
touch

436
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,830
no actually required that's the
thumbprint gizmo

437
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,360
I was looking for so you don't have to
swipe it you can just

438
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,949
lay a finger on it and

439
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:54,470
you want this to be available in APs it
should be a common experience in PC

440
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,300
settings

441
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:02,300
I you want it to you to suppose an app
wanted to sport in app purchase

442
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:08,350
so you you have a PC with their a cool
casual gaming you get the thing to your

443
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,090
kid

444
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,760
to play with and the kid next thing you
know its turnaround about a thousand

445
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,270
dollars with artifacts in the game

446
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,540
going on with the duyck in app purchase

447
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,740
mix would force you to reoffend okay to
say no I really meant to purchase that

448
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,250
and this biometric support

449
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,930
plums the biometrics API's from not just

450
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,280
win log on but now makes it available to
aP's

451
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,070
and that's actually an authentic user
gesture

452
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,820
because it doesn't result in coughing up
the password to the app

453
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,919
result in Windows authenticating to the
cloud that you are in fact you

454
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,920
and then connecting the app back into
the loop

455
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,710
so the this protects you in scenarios
where it's primarily a single use a

456
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,260
machine like this is my PC the kid
doesn't have an account on it but maybe

457
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,680
wants to play a game

458
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,710
so it allows me to confidently hand the
machine over to the kid

459
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,410
without getting a huge bill for crazy
online through purchases

460
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:18,470
way so

461
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,380
including you can give

462
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,060
Windows 8 PC to your family with some
confidence

463
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,850
that Windows will help defend itself
against Trojan horse attacks and

464
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,610
socially engineered attacks

465
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,959
the SmartScreen defender will prevent

466
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,160
your family from obliviously loading now
where that some website told them was a

467
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,270
really good idea

468
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,710
and the Windows Store app SAR

469
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,390
that plus curation so they're very
unlikely to be malicious because they

470
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,230
were on board

471
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,310
there even less likely to be malicious
because what killed it them as soon as

472
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,190
they do something

473
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,590
the restricted environment at the apt
container

474
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,220
makes it very difficult for malicious
app to do anything interesting to you

475
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,570
without your interaction

476
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,819
and therefore they resort to social
engineering and thing was social

477
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,620
engineering attacks as you can see them

478
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,888
so they get reported to the store so
they get killed it so they don't live

479
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:18,139
very long so the odds of it happening to
you

480
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,010
very very low they might happen to
somebody you know someone in the planet

481
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,399
someone in the room got the malicious
app one day

482
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,629
then it happened a few times then they
complained about it then it was killed

483
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:33,600
no endemic Windows RT in addition

484
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,440
drive encryption on by default so I can
leave this in a taxi without me I'm

485
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,510
annoyed I lost my lovely surface but

486
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:47,600
I didn't lose my identity in my
passwords you can give it to your staff

487
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,610
with confidence

488
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,570
you get the same protection is as with
consumers against all that

489
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,980
hoops I shouldn't have done that stuff
and energy right and present can create

490
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,990
a secure and manageable environment

491
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:05,020
with enhanced access controls and device
health at s station

492
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,340
and so forth easy nice enterprise
features

493
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,450
and though Windows business products

494
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,490
support the same device encryption but
with the keys stored

495
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,629
under enterprise management instead of
just shoved in your personal clout

496
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,900
you an you

497
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,020
my actually want one too every my giving
it to those other clueless people you

498
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,160
could use one because

499
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,430
I bet that you visited UPS website

500
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,640
you downloading exceed that you're not
real sure about

501
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,339
I'll or you left a device for passwords
in a taxi

502
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:45,340
thank you questions

503
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,649
so thank you for the doc arm so
basically im

504
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,960
arm lot of the security posture comes
from

505
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,430
giving control to Microsoft um which

506
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,450
you know everyone can decide to do or
not my question is why on earth did you

507
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,629
give the control

508
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,140
love the signing keys for you leave if I

509
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,500
to semantic of all people like

510
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,019
I cannot get assigning certificated for
putting something else on

511
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,720
on secure boot Windows machine from
Microsoft I actually have to go to

512
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,459
semantic

513
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,650
because we didn't want to be in the key
business

514
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:40,069
okay there there's an industry Philip
key business and we

515
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:44,700
gave it to the leading vendor a what we
wanted to do

516
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,490
ways prove simultaneously provide the
capability that

517
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,758
we can have secure boot that the system
can be all the way up and we can be sure

518
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,029
that it was not some malware stuff

519
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:58,279
and have it open

520
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,390
so that Linex industry can also

521
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,150
boot something up and have it be secure
that the hardware said yup this is

522
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,079
really intended in its not now where

523
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,470
and there's no way to do that without
having some kind of CA in the loop

524
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,149
so we had fido.ca

525
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,240
there's a CA hi

526
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,209
ya know Google great talk for some all I
think we are moving in the right

527
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,029
direction

528
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:28,309
my question is how long do you think it
will be before I can stop telling my

529
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:29,950
mother to be careful what

530
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,740
things she clicks on and what app she
stars I

531
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,008
I think they're where they're now if you
give her

532
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:42,970
surface RT with you give her a Windows

533
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,410
eighty not RT the

534
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:51,868
classic Intel and AMD processors then
she can still go out into the classic

535
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,690
environment and click on things

536
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,039
I smart screen will say you probably
shouldn't do that but if your mother's

537
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,829
determined she can do it anyway

538
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:04,269
so they're somewhat less assurance their
so

539
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,660
is that the only platform I can you
heard that would today

540
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,629
achieve such safety on the web well it's
a matter of degree

541
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:18,630
IITs carry

542
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,410
Delft University I'm thank you some of
these

543
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,598
future some really exciting regarding
the

544
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,480
kill bits as you called it what is the
possibility of this feature giving

545
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,589
abused in for instance copyrights

546
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:38,180
the fun fights or for whatever reason if
a nap

547
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,430
needs to get its wiped off or all across
the globe um

548
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,180
so not not to security thing you
intended well

549
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,649
Microsoft has absolute control over the
kill bit

550
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,200
and we don't use it lightly because we
don't like getting sued by suffer

551
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,788
vendors

552
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:59,220
we only used to kill bit when we're sure
that something is malware

553
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:04,538
II if we have other issues with an
application we have softer measures than

554
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:05,210
the killed it

555
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,970
right I understand Microsoft's motive
here but

556
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,430
I mean if you have the teacher there
it's possible

557
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,089
for someone else to sue Microsoft to do
that or force Microsoft to do that i

558
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:18,720
mean

559
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,808
the capabilities there so all the app
platforms have that feature

560
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:30,809
Chris manilow follow up on that

561
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,558
9 another kill but related question a

562
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,359
slightly different although where he s
was kinda my concern

563
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,460
but a and these these two related but
one is can the

564
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,990
um does your kilby to store user data

565
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,399
that maybe generated from the is a

566
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,490
to define terms carefully there's

567
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:01,000
ap state is in the app folder that is
dedicated to that app

568
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,720
mmm user data is stuff that the app

569
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,779
had to export by going through that file
broker I showed you

570
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:11,960
so if that

571
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,890
some ap I'm not gonna not you name that
weren't as its not malware but

572
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,700
if some app for malicious than all

573
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,470
its ap state its settings would be
removed from the PC but the files that

574
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,319
it exported would not

575
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,269
okay something in particular is the case
with Amazon

576
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:34,200
the polls & ebook over copyright dispute

577
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,598
and he was something the public to that
securing the copyright properly

578
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,599
yeah an early exit kid that had

579
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,500
annotations for his book report get
destroyed in the process

580
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,529
I so I I can't predict what would have
happened legally in that scenario but at

581
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,180
a technical level

582
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,220
if the app in question the kid had said
say that

583
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,720
as and exported the document adding to
his document folder where there is a PDF

584
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,169
for these annotations

585
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,930
then that would not have been removed if
he had just left the book

586
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,980
in the app state then it would have been
removed

587
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,769
so there are cases where the date a day
generate innocence generated by the user

588
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:18,038
could be store with the app and then
lost one its

589
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,599
yes it depends what the app does okay
okay

590
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,460
on the other things with the kill bit
mmm is a Kill Bill mandatory

591
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,380
or can a user opt out or defer

592
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,650
removal a.m. you if you opt out of movie

593
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,160
then the killed it becomes discretionary

594
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,279
by its owner is getting aP's

595
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:43,569
though is that mean that comes with the
same channel if you choose to get the

596
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:44,069
app

597
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:47,920
if you choose to get any app's you
choose to accept installing aP's comes

598
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,599
through

599
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,289
so to kill bits and that means if if if
you issue

600
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:56,549
kill order it happens whether or not the

601
00:41:56,549 --> 00:41:59,859
user wants to right sacred Nokia we

602
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:03,970
we don't use it a lot that's fine I'll
tell you my reason for asking

603
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,069
raise as I think you know some people
they don't know

604
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:10,180
I work in Observatory where you

605
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,399
if we're you cosmic a fancy don't get do
overs for in AM

606
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,720
I we might be in the situation where
it's like okay we understand this need

607
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,919
to get removed

608
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,619
right now we don't want nothing to
change on the system

609
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:26,849
would be happy to do it after the events
over

610
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,750
something like that so if you want your
whole system lock down for

611
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,009
fixed duration yet turn off woo
conversely you could

612
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:39,430
either design or choose maps that don't
store your stellar events in app state

613
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,549
they sorry and

614
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:43,660
user folder right well you

615
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,799
sometimes we don't get the choice which
jet skis about that

616
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:49,829
but as a technical matter that's what
will happen yeah okay

617
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:55,119
thanks

618
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,200
be so

619
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,348
crisp and so is situated for something I
surface RT

620
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:05,890
the only evocation that can run is to
the App Store

621
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,480
I'm the technical requirement is that
the only

622
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,489
programs that can run on RT are those
that are signed by Microsoft

623
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:17,829
and all the stuff that goes through the
App Store is signed by Microsoft it

624
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,329
signed by the App Store

625
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:23,940
I in addition RT ships with a copy of
Office that was signed by Microsoft that

626
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,230
runs on the classic desktop

627
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,259
so then it's not a machine suitable for
students to develop their own program

628
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:32,369
and

629
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:37,500
and S&D project

630
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,339
I'm not sure about that again suppose I

631
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:46,269
Houston's to by c:\program and is run on
Windows

632
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:52,758
you can unlock all this stuff by
installing what we call a developer key

633
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:57,059
so you you have to go through a few
hoops to unlock the device so that are

634
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:02,150
ideal now let you do what you want so
that you can do development on it

635
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,430
okay thank you

636
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,690
mentioned in the AM your presentation
you really

637
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,750
sorry little closer you mentioned you're
able to with the new you

638
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,000
UEFI boot everything's gonna be signed

639
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,579
prior to this what controls were

640
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:23,069
your protection anything against where
the CA itself

641
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:27,069
compromised or this difficult sell for
me this has happened before

642
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:30,569
okay we're a according to so-called

643
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,960
Stuxnet they actually 42 certificate
balance

644
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,270
CA and also with the fact that and I T

645
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,910
recently had a article talking about how
new developments

646
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,219
from lack was a blast black hat their
time any developments in mathematics

647
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,099
saying that that

648
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,270
you know order cryptosystems may
actually be

649
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,190
risk for being cover compromise all

650
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,480
what protections to you UEFI have for
that

651
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,190
and say a certificate does get
compromised

652
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,309
is there how does the device get get
that

653
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:08,500
that revocation their is a kill protocol
in UEFI so that

654
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,200
%ah I don't like don't work on that
features I don't know what the

655
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,020
granularity at the kill bit for UEFI is

656
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,819
whether it's individual packages RCA's
or whatever I do not know

657
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,190
but we can kill individual things that
got compromised

658
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:29,809
I'm I'm not aware I've many systems in
the universe that are resilient to

659
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:33,520
suddenly discovering that factor ability
is polynomial

660
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,089
I'm we do try to maintain crypto agility

661
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:41,150
thats we

662
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,230
strongly recommend against people hard
coating any cipher

663
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,089
you should just use you know public key
signature and underneath the covers will

664
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:50,770
use the best one

665
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,969
I am so if

666
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:58,190
our essay is broken I imagine there will
be a lot of running around and not just

667
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,279
at Microsoft

668
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:02,969
as everyone flips over to whatever
public key

669
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:09,969
protocols are not broken

670
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,940
Scott Carlin Princeton University I'm
can you expand a little bit on the a

671
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,160
smart screen technology it seems like

672
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,549
that's a place where basically
everybody's browser history in the world

673
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,790
goes right to Microsoft and there seems
to be some you know privacy security

674
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,830
implications

675
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,900
you opt into it you don't have to do it
if you don't want to

676
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,430
okay and Shh we

677
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,990
Joan look at it we just reputation
jacket

678
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:46,279
is that a fishing say is the check some
on that program known bad where

679
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,610
or is it known good where I programs are
also checked by publisher

680
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:56,200
so if it's unknown software publishers
certificate and they shipped the new

681
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,669
program we don't start failing it just
because it's new software

682
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,250
everybody please sign your programs if
you're serious about distributing them

683
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:10,250
thank you

684
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,080
thank you very much
