1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,000
good morning

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,820
isn't getting out thanks for getting up
for never spoken

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,170
on 9 a.m.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,680
for I did not expect this is Wrexham so

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,140
is we're going to cover the day um time
permitting

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,320
given the one hour speaking
thirty-minute question format might go

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,750
over to get to talk sim 21

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,670
making am so it's a part 1 will will be
security team 2.0 which is the

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,840
content as described in in the AM

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,100
in the program and what we're doing here
is we're trying and you talk where we

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,710
sort of

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,430
look at some other things we've done
very differently to traditional security

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:48,780
team

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,100
when we set up the crime security team
I'm eating some things we've done

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,440
differently worked out quite well

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,570
so I'd like to tell you about them on
the course that there is that by

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,110
thanks for sharing the things that we've
done nah methodology on

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,390
you might I want to copy some other
things with them when you find yourself

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,320
sitting here and security teams in the
future

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,830
and the second thing is I'm whenever

21
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,640
with a little work done we find that one
of the things people most excited about

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,640
am another miss questions about his is a
vessel wall programs that's why we

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,729
and get monetary rewards to researchers
he or

24
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,798
things to us that we think a significant
and time permitting

25
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,310
will will dive into the history there
and some of the statistics

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,210
other in statistics relating to the sort
of man

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,158
with pay with PayPal and so on and also
hope to you

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,500
devotes a time questions I'm so some
brief introductions

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,249
the mine I'm Chris Evans informal

30
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:49,170
try Nancy and im phone tight love
troublemakers and he said

31
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,960
um I got my business cards would ever
had remote cabin with me and

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,158
says trouble-maker something they've
done

33
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,409
tended to what's important things going
to be talking about

34
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,520
just to give you an idea of where I'm
coming from so in 2009 I found it

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,940
he the former Prime security thing um

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,780
I wanna for sins we didn't wanna the
best things we did in retrospect was

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,420
relaunched

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,929
war program to try I'm get more
community involvement

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,010
I'm that one so of crime that am

40
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,410
Google wide in the same year we launched
a web reward program

41
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,420
that was kind of a big deal with all the
time because

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,670
inviting searches to serve download your
your clients I product in research is

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,640
very different mean by

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,220
my searches to um researcher life
services is not you can download Gmail

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,549
insurance or local

46
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,860
machine and research ship that several

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,260
how that went I'm following on

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,609
later we launched a competition for
Michael pentium with larger prizes but

49
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,159
with a

50
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,120
with more difficult challenges will that
little bit um

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,349
others may consoles work in the past and
when I'm not I'm not too busy to injury

52
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:58,879
if I

53
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,569
when time permits loading a bit of
securities his history of the crime

54
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,450
security team

55
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,329
so am I think it all started back in

56
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,650
probably 2007 was the first significant
event in life

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,069
I'm security team and that was actually
an acquisition

58
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm people acquire a company called
green border on this was a

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,950
the company that hedonism some books and
technology

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,280
and that actually the time worked to
some books Internet Explorer browser

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,260
and the name report comes in the fact
that when you would run

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,689
Internet Explorer running inside
disagree with technology you actually

63
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:36,909
see the Internet Explorer window

64
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,390
with the green border I indicating that
this some actual samples again on their

65
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,219
am of course a %uh plans with you crime
went public at this time but team

66
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:45,920
expects

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,939
obviously this is an acquisition sort of
forming a the basis of the crime

68
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,810
security model

69
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,290
which was from some boxing so

70
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,000
do himself on so its public launch in
2008

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,689
based course in the green for some books
technology on

72
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,930
right out of the gate was wearing in
beta we tangled with a few security

73
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,870
issues maybe that one of the motivations
to

74
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,879
formalizing crime security team the
beginning we've had this role call the

75
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,890
security sheriff

76
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,469
and we still have it Anna number for

77
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,680
in before st. formalize the crime
security team

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,550
the engineers from the green border
position I'll see for a strong engineers

79
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,100
and

80
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,450
know about security so they sort of
handle income security issues

81
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,650
and in May 2009 I which they've been

82
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,650
inside google to go in fun prints
greeting

83
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,469
so I was very excited I'm and I'll see
you just want me is difficult to

84
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,100
get everything you want on silent to the
task hiring and it wasn't until October

85
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,450
I'm that I managed to get a first higher
and

86
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,440
am as many things from 10 just just
really hot hard to hide it security

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,290
people in the United months have elapsed

88
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,420
between me starting in getting my first
time next

89
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,160
underline we we are in a situation where
it's hard to find good security people

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,140
and then it was another say six months
also forgot mass get a second higher

91
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,340
being the team to three am by name
inferno

92
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,340
you since then has probably from a
browser bugs anyone on the planet

93
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,609
am South bit higher expect I'm and then
after those first he has them

94
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,780
unknown reasons thing sped up and
realtor

95
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,429
too great a team quite significantly

96
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,810
so what what we think we we've done well
in from skating and them

97
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,660
this is the sales pitch those cases
quickly but it's sort of a background

98
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,110
for

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,320
name think they've done some things well
and then we're going to what we did

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,010
cause these things so I'm for the
beginning we

101
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,180
am willing to tackle from about a bit
software which we thought was for the

102
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,260
biggest problem that was

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,620
is causing the damage out there on the
internet so was a baked

104
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,660
I know automatic update process into the
browser so that you don't have to worry

105
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,080
about

106
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,620
up to date on up on I mention the green
border positions so

107
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,930
we'll see with a we think the first
puzzle with them

108
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,340
with the samples for the isolated the
file system from and from our

109
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,340
on we've since you since looked at the

110
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,700
threats out there and there's a lot of
if he is God's love

111
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm the bugs around the area Adobe Flash
so

112
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,039
across multiple years meet with Pope to
that plugins either

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,380
the fulcrum samples on

114
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,600
we also think ahead of the curve with
the recent Sam

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,380
Java issues you may have read about has
quite a a little press earlier this year

116
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,940
about him

117
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,630
problems in scares in Java plugin I'm a
couple of years

118
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,420
before this we actually were sort of
predicting that this might happen and we

119
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,330
were

120
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,710
the plans and defense in that area such
as user interaction forum

121
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,159
for launching some in the morning just
plugins

122
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,530
we've demonstrated the ability to to a
very fast turnaround

123
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,340
mmm because if I mention they were all
programs free feel ready

124
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,190
want things I'm most proud of as telling
mentioned in the introduction -ism

125
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,219
some the technologies we baked into the
browser actually

126
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,450
could have a significant in which is
where allegedly

127
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,180
some something Iran that compromised

128
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,820
it in a toast if authority I'm is
definite

129
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,610
special originate authorities
compromising is alleged that

130
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,820
that some given Iran it done this now of
the

131
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,230
has love I'm I love safety consequences
potentially for people

132
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,780
in in that area of the world

133
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,590
and we maintain /url Wareham for to be a
modest but we

134
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,099
now says one /url on our on a website
where we have some unabashed modesty and

135
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,450
sorta

136
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,070
list things we've done keep up to date

137
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,210
okay so into part 1 so

138
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,549
I'm a hypothesis is that some other
successes

139
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,740
which we've just nervous list of to me
after heated

140
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,010
just some things we've done in setting
up the security team that

141
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,780
very different out additional security
team might be set up

142
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,969
so let's look at these differences so
the way we're going to look at each

143
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,700
difference

144
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,580
-ism festival going to look at how

145
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,609
a more traditional company or perhaps
most companies might have the security

146
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,420
team set up

147
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,710
and so more traditional companies
donated by this icon agency

148
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,079
I'm have a other seeking titanate more

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,490
same a corporate environment Anna

150
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,890
and the first difference going to talk
about is fix it yourself

151
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,620
so i think is an object or dirty
syringes but

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,660
this one with we found is a Withings a
particularly big difference to me think

153
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,800
the benefits it is bordered

154
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,500
up on I want the bigger benefits

155
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,519
so by fix it was by fixed itself

156
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,110
what we mean well in this case let's
look at what it means is that if not do

157
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,279
things to fix itself

158
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,560
same in what additional security team

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,349
on my final the security team operates
quite

160
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,550
missus time in a consultancy roles maybe

161
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,649
so looking for issues doing all this
Alan

162
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,389
is a founding might just sort of write a
report and more I'm

163
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,550
use the term throw it over the wall
that's where you sorta found some issues

164
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,599
and shove for David FM team say

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,610
a the world's on fire you are I'm the
sort out these issues

166
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,509
so that's thats yeah security governing
consult your own

167
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:42,500
yes

168
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,830
can get hurt if the back okay

169
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,100
I your I can france pick up we can meet
Mike maybe

170
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,270
I am

171
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,220
so still on for national security team
on

172
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,240
you may find that the Thai people
employed on a more traditional security

173
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,650
team

174
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,490
maybe the sort of job titles awaited
more towards

175
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,350
analyst or researcher I'm as opposed to

176
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,630
more engineering like titles so

177
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,830
but see it as a different way to do
things

178
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,340
so this icon he represents so that the
more progressive way of doing things

179
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,820
and the way we've done things in the
ukraine skating am sincerely

180
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,410
loss thus even tie weaver don't have
collated gotta

181
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,079
t-shirt here on the who claim they gonna
and a all pretty happy as well as you

182
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,620
can see

183
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,360
say something

184
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,950
we do being often see say the members
the crime security team

185
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,080
often actually write code and

186
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,710
commit K representing the fixes for
security bugs and get ourselves

187
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,950
and that's that's going to be different
so we we might even find about ourselves

188
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,410
and then is that a friend over the wall

189
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,630
say well you know but only just fixity

190
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,180
and of course

191
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,339
more things we fix you find something
familiar with the case say

192
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,660
as well as just fixing individual issues
you might find ourselves motivated to

193
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,790
to jump in and actually improve areas
whether

194
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,459
have been I'm statistically enormous
amount of bugs might say well it's just

195
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,990
going to help the rights there

196
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,110
making more robust and ami

197
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,700
knowing that his we do WEA you can
empower to sort of plan not just

198
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,560
security fixes but serves

199
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,030
security hardening measures so in effect
of this house

200
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,990
is that your service is a part of the
product team I'm

201
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,080
and organization that we are actually if
you look at our organization which are

202
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,350
actually part of the crime organization
not some

203
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:57,350
not some dedicated security organization
most people with hired

204
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,290
the weapon it is you've hyped and
anti-people the

205
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,390
engineers a passionate about security

206
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,210
on as opposed to perhaps people to
conserve security people

207
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,500
you now if engineering and that sort of
helps with the mentality where

208
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,910
when you find something that's it's
broken and needs fixing

209
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,920
consider throwing it over the wall with
just which dive in and fix ourselves

210
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,270
because we're we like coating when
motivated

211
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,189
to dive in and change the code base so
putting all this together we really

212
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,710
found

213
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,070
some significant and positive feedback
need to develop

214
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,670
yes a the more we get our hands in the
code and fix things

215
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,680
more we learn about the case the more we
know about the case more likely be our

216
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,189
last

217
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,280
lost on changing things make a disorder
use a sick

218
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,560
security powers native do believe kaelin
on the site and find additional issues

219
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,689
for fixing one issue

220
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,280
that's one feedback loop that develops
another the public that develops

221
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,360
we find is um is

222
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,150
a deep respect from the security people
and

223
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,959
me product engineers say if you have
never wanted the

224
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,790
they's to the security people in the
previous companies maybe they've worked

225
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,079
at

226
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,110
who are suffering problems on them and
his buddies

227
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,650
emergency put down my speech you working
on a fix is now

228
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,120
and said now it's like a fun about I'm
but we

229
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,920
you know we think this patch might fix
it would you mind would you mind helping

230
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,740
us with you

231
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,920
and things like things like this and we
find that

232
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,040
suddenly went on these hated security
people there is causing problems with

233
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,860
these people

234
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,710
engineers his peers at the coming to
them with solutions and

235
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,180
and we think down that that

236
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,910
encourages other respect between the two
teams and

237
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,050
this respect we found it's actually
bankable say the more you do the more

238
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,890
you think someone else's bucks for them

239
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,240
the more so the Moorebank you build up
and then when something really naughty

240
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
comes in that's a

241
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,560
maybe more for design Aravind just about
him and was struggling to fix it

242
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
ourselves we can

243
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,969
over to the engine and say hey I'm would
you mind helping us with this and of

244
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,690
course since we've

245
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,709
help them so much that have their more
than happy to help out

246
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,430
so they take away from this is that the
closer you bet your security people

247
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,260
with the product team we find that
within the KC

248
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,890
case you get those two groups just a
more benefit

249
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,839
and this applies some within for all
there is a sphere

250
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,080
in ranging from the initial response to
this for proactive work

251
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,610
and so on so the next if

252
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,089
say this on school is all of ok and this
is a

253
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,030
this is a mentality we've will try to
develop I'm

254
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,520
and say the

255
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,579
the corporate guy he's a uniting some
crazy no its not all

256
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,670
all of what he talking about am

257
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,089
what that really means is that as a as a
traditional security team yuri

258
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,150
disinclined dispatching disincentive ice
tackle

259
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,240
problems outside the product immediately
a an to say say say it was good teams

260
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,010
multiple product tax

261
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,680
as we did for a little incentive fee to
go in and fix things in in product white

262
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,380
because thats

263
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,850
units know how your it's not I agree it
performance review time it's

264
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,440
not how are your manages want you to be
doing

265
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,440
save is there a different things

266
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,780
turns out there is so of us here a

267
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,790
is this we've taken a step back and try
to apply

268
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,280
there's a company-wide use a focused

269
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,560
culture Salem we sorta look at that and
security remote watch the

270
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,089
coming back with is that we think that
if any problem we see out there

271
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,120
is a security problem affecting of
harming line uses

272
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,460
will just say well you know what is
awful and we're gonna

273
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,630
gonna solve this or at least tackle it

274
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,410
for have problems of course week and not
yet sold in security

275
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,439
so that mean in practice

276
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,530
it's different from what we might might
do if you want thinking it was awful

277
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,620
well this means that

278
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,740
if we depend on any third-party code

279
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,430
in that's not so the valve falls our
code hours

280
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,640
our bugs gonna go and fix as anyway
regards a few

281
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,030
in a regardless of politics sometimes

282
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,930
analyzes the party code of course

283
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,459
a lot of web browsers these days special
events or things like crime is a Firefox

284
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,660
a built-in pop-up love open source code
am

285
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,890
I'm since we know collapse directly
involve product in bed of course we

286
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,580
consider that

287
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,490
yeah I responsibility if there are bugs
that but I am

288
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,670
increasingly we're looking at sort of
know my pencils proprietary

289
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,110
non vendor non-google vindicated that
has an effect on the security of the web

290
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,700
as a whole

291
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,800
and with considering

292
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,240
well the best since before uses is is
help out getting stuff fixed

293
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm there are some historical

294
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,440
is expensive sessions in area browsing
to do with

295
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,550
I'm for example love security 1.0 X
perhaps on the optimal

296
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,448
trying to although all the browsers
behave the same way in this regard so

297
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:09,959
we're trying to

298
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,209
we're trying to tackle some some history
there in some legacy that

299
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,640
and Sam you may seem agents paper

300
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,699
earlier conference where she's looking
at that some the problems that you act

301
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:22,350
and how we can

302
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,679
with the web forward their including
buddy web sites

303
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,350
so to give one example

304
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,830
that's the lot across site scripting out
there my have me this far along here as

305
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,639
we had hoped City

306
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,000
that is such a big problem that we we so
say well maybe

307
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,740
if his love cross-site scripting out
that maybe it's the fault of the

308
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,490
platform

309
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,410
maybe the browser's of a different
platform facilities in a bit less

310
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,600
besides getting out there

311
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,280
so we see that as a problem take said we

312
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,620
we just try to focus on what the right
thing to do is to improve the security

313
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,310
of the web

314
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,879
we try to ignore anti-politics your
concerns here

315
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,540
and to give some concrete examples

316
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,040
what what's in scope a first look at say
to

317
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,700
main categories come to mind one is
plugins so we don't

318
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,740
of the major plugins you'll find on the
web things like um

319
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,620
flash PDF plugins Java we don't really

320
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,870
own the code base for days but we still
try to

321
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,239
where we can help out secure those and
increasing in

322
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,300
in modern times colonels so along most
of these days you finds

323
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,840
is getting some books and said the
attacker

324
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,070
has a sort of break your software and
then they find themselves in the sandbox

325
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,360
and then they have to break out over
someone's our the most popular and

326
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,870
and in fact dangerous ways to make up
for some boxes to attack the underlying

327
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,030
operating system

328
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,850
so actually you with a lot of research
to try and improve the quality of both

329
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,550
the windows

330
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,129
panel and the and the Linux kernel by
today's

331
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,430
what product on Kb own safe I use is
very important that these

332
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,000
those two camels be very solid against
against security attacks a

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,650
if they suck bugs me just say well you
know considered of als

334
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:14,650
so putting and some sources to try and
fix that

335
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,860
okay um this one's more nebulous
difference

336
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,409
say I we're gonna look at it was an
examples but I go the extra mile

337
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,570
is this the %um to different say I i've
just

338
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,090
season of Lost phase where they are but
I'm these a

339
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,260
the point of me quoting me is that

340
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,850
you'll sees things like this everywhere
every company maverick source project

341
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,080
so if you go and look up like the false
fears random Project X

342
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,330
try and find that security force the
page it will be fine

343
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,540
the bait him a phrase like we take
security very seriously

344
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,720
am have as anyone here

345
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,020
reported about it all to to a vendor
tool anyone

346
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,150
10 securities in extent Bhatia maybe

347
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,540
you go back north may deem a fairly
quickly and and maybe verbatim it

348
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,889
included a phrase such as

349
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,050
we take security very seriously after
thank you for your report so

350
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,270
its or maybe I'll

351
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,970
securities on our top priorities is a is
another one I'm if you

352
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,860
go on Google for these for these these
quotes using the quotes to get the exact

353
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,000
match your DC

354
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,680
row after row of Cooper corporate
website the quote these things

355
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,790
ansonia the I'm getting too is this this
is what we Michael talk the talk

356
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,980
%ah this is walk the walk so

357
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,980
I mean I mean you have to say these
things I mean what you gonna say we know

358
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,140
securities name maybe eight out of 10 on
a Friday list or

359
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,540
or you know is we should have designed
this and then

360
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,450
security on later and I've course is
gonna because you're gonna say you takes

361
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,240
very seriously

362
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,020
say to go the extra mile you've got even
look at actions

363
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,910
you know where the what he'd done that
that that basic cause you to

364
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,490
take some invoked in pain upon yourself
in order to it improve security

365
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,530
so that's a plus they will will be
something even if it's hard even if his

366
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,160
painful

367
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,160
or at least two will try it. them

368
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,590
so had a

369
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,730
glitch that so back to the old school
working things

370
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,340
so say and local government you might

371
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,639
you might find generally known security
concerns and outweigh security concerns

372
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,110
what I mean by that is say on secure
security engineers found this fantastic

373
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,429
new security defense that

374
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,740
really is quite powerful but it Anna
maybe it's gonna

375
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,860
cost you attempt some forms hit on some
hotly contested benchmark I think you

376
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,429
might guess

377
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:51,660
you know when it comes to the product
review stage he's going to win that you

378
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,750
often find a

379
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,770
few she finds it is my legacies

380
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,680
is impeding progress and that's not the
case where well perhaps I'm not going

381
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,410
the extra mile

382
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,830
where up the legacy is usually involves
Holdco

383
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,780
painful to change I'm to go the extra
mile you've really got us a

384
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,230
dive in and and be loved

385
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,270
lot of work for the benefit you're going
from security say

386
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,720
will what might look like if he

387
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,900
have a culture going the extra mile se
recovered some say

388
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,180
tackle others problems for them so

389
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,240
I think I think we do go the extra mile
when we on the sort of look at

390
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,610
what compromises going on on web large

391
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,990
and we see that from a quite different
why is not necessary owned by us is

392
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,680
causing

393
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,150
unit offended if he's a compromise so
what we've ended as we can

394
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,090
I'm investment source in thing some
security auditing on

395
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,090
why and send these this box along one
thing we found it's kind of painful

396
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,460
but we do it because meetings right
thing to do -ism is also the pasta what

397
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,550
you found and fixed to security bug

398
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,659
what he do next um

399
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,210
you sort of have the easy option in the
hard option where the easy option

400
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,490
is just sort of that fix get picked up
in the product

401
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,190
in a couple reese's time when that they
can actually get has picked up next

402
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,880
major release

403
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,090
we try doing this is painful I'm this
risk to doing it

404
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,290
week we tryin within a very short time
frame

405
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,020
grab that fix and back for it

406
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,480
said use a get-tough fixed to the stable
version of the product as soon as

407
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,110
possible

408
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,840
and a working stove goal is is a month
which is quite aggressive

409
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,679
but that's a month turnaround from above
comes in and user

410
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,400
has that that fixed in the stable
version of that

411
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,930
for these an important this applies to
internal fines as well

412
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,410
so most is about to be fine now we find
internally because we've

413
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,500
release you scaled up in and have
thousands of CPU causes

414
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,400
doing automated testing and fussing so
fun little bugs internally

415
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,460
and then we're faced with you know who
do these bugs

416
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,030
a meat-eating exactly the same as if
we've received the report externally

417
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,510
saving their internal we we declare we
found these buttons that are

418
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,830
you next week on the carpet and we also
back for the city

419
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,919
to the extent possible and that's been a
painful them you know we get counted out

420
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,360
a lot by the res managers for

421
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,909
an emerging lots of things all the time
and that they know

422
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,150
that everything you change the risk of
breakage or aggression or boxes if the

423
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,260
balance that we

424
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,370
we think we've got ourselves a seat at
the table to discuss

425
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,500
units risk versus reward trade-offs am
spending money

426
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,830
when something the extra mile like them
to this day I don't have any particular

427
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,310
budget or headcount

428
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,080
limit I'm aware of this that's that's
quite nice feeling

429
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,570
will spend money on hardware I mentioned
we we do a fucing

430
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,850
I think we have we have we have an in
the crime team have about 2,000 CPU

431
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,980
cores at our disposal

432
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,310
the white a skating bouquets and you do

433
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,980
to work for us they've run up to like
nine thousand CPU cores to be

434
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,470
to do testing for security at times I
think that

435
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,680
and finally do not shy away from changes
in behavior

436
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,500
so no on re like to change in behavior

437
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,780
because if you change some small the
Nativity King something

438
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,030
pictures like a father someone somewhere
is probably going to be upset

439
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,690
I'm am sometimes changing behavior is
the right thing to do

440
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,610
so we we should've at least

441
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,570
this about we've come to is that we have
to missions it to them

442
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,750
to massive hats

443
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,080
explain myself I went heavily we saw the
company's understanding where where

444
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,270
liberty to try things as long as we
think so

445
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,460
overstep the line 25 am and you know
that you have this liberty

446
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,290
if on occasion he love it if I'm break
something a bit too significant and you

447
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,510
know that's happened in the past me

448
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,780
say sorry and scale things back but a K

449
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,700
so just a brief tension here

450
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,940
on kinda for reflection perhaps on

451
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,330
on on our industry am

452
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,480
and I'll say once one season understand
this comic-con where it's coming from

453
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,600
and that is actually kinda true it

454
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,330
does change your mentality on on the
going the extra mile we found say what

455
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,389
what this is a comic

456
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,110
I'm that was published as part of a
series

457
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:37,100
comics by some people on some morse we
say attack side of the industry

458
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,050
and and is coming to the palestinians
what it's saying is that name

459
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,830
site mocking tone it saying to you this
as some random searches

460
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,030
you know who I found a bug I'm I'm so
pleased the basics paint either

461
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,180
you with statistical probability

462
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,450
you when not the first to know about
this bug

463
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,000
and yes but it's not was in public so
therefore

464
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,460
you know this this but was probably out
there known by someone he

465
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,720
using it for nefarious purpose I wants

466
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,410
once the reality of this SM we found
that change the mentality forget the

467
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,050
extra mile

468
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,090
say whenever we find about what I i with
we've got the thing about this could be

469
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,879
because someone else knows about this
but

470
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,630
so that this it strives of Los

471
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,170
um time for a civil war story if you
like so

472
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,320
we find that so far too

473
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,550
it's hard to define go the extra mile in
SE so full that stories but we think you

474
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,610
have gone the extra mile

475
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,379
and that's what we quickly if you hear

476
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,060
so I do apologize for the sudden an
abrupt

477
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:51,060
changes slight style Ibiza mixing and
matching tax here a bit

478
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,340
so is a couple is going out to a company
called

479
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,820
view and perform but we time a
non-disclosure on us

480
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I mean it I think it's worth talking
about full disclosure versus responsible

481
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,030
disclosure anymore

482
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,470
I think that what you have to be worried
about his non-disclosure so that's where

483
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,430
back to that comic that's where
someone's found a bug and they're not

484
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,080
telling

485
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,389
anyone about it um because in it what
he's up active

486
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,060
make love money did which turn implies
that that some

487
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,379
something not good going on without
bucks a non-disclosure

488
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,050
Anna is what we are about and in fact if
someone full discloses on its with the

489
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,399
light it is something we can then
immediately fix

490
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,400
which is perhaps a turnaround from more
traditional thinking

491
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,930
anyways this non-disclosure was so that
was a partial non-disclosure space

492
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,640
me the formalism YouTube video

493
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,370
I'm showing an alleged compromise if the
Chrome browser

494
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,709
but i've seen 0 details that would

495
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,300
domestic and fix up but because that's
not the business model if this

496
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,419
particular company

497
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,120
a more normal security team do well you
know this claim is just a video of a cow

498
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,159
popping up pretty much just to keep
young verifiable claims the

499
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,360
he just dnt no rain go away he's come to
us for me

500
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,959
when you want to share openly with this
security research

501
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,930
you know hand of the PR team to serve
its back down the report is a

502
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:19,710
trying to make a story out a number of a
plane I would we d

503
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:23,200
so we thought well as take this
seriously most what we do about 30

504
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,900
minutes

505
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,080
this no details have any useful so to
say I'm

506
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,290
this is a freeze-frame from the actual
reach you

507
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,300
non-disclosure video am

508
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,020
showing if you made a business this text
inside the crime

509
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,610
when themselves in your browser is being
own not long of

510
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,159
and something's going on in the
background not long after this in the

511
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,660
video thing account data pops up

512
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,610
which is unity miss industry standard
for demonstrating compromise to browse a

513
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,209
am say what we did is we salute a frame
by frame

514
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,940
view at this video to see if there's any
information leaked

515
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,010
you know nor officers in a crowded
around a machine for a day

516
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,360
trying to work out if you get anything
out this video and this particular frame

517
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,120
is quite instructive we found saying

518
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,310
racism observed in a piece and not how
you can see it to

519
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:17,300
um sit behind the crime when does the
Windows Task Manager window

520
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,419
and the reason that's been left office
to serve demonstrates

521
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,470
that they freak out a crime samples I'm

522
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,710
as it happens you can see that the crime
icon there and just above the crime I

523
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,270
call you can see a couple of pixels have
grave

524
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,600
the sort of the to serve program entry
fee like above

525
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm icon it as well as a significant
invalid just that it really is to raise

526
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,379
pixels and this is fifteen villages or
it

527
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,490
the only way you'd see that icon is if

528
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,980
even launched if you've launched our day
be fast break a process

529
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,250
so immediate telling us why we think
this might be

530
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,570
very significant information me we thank
you my point about

531
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,620
in on incrimination in flash so

532
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,780
is anything else we we can ascertain yes
a

533
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,110
integrity level is shown in the task
manager

534
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,520
fortunately wanna 120 members was was at
the time

535
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,330
an expert and in this some

536
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,419
in this process via piece of lani happen
to know that I am

537
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,810
there's a bug in it way mislabeled
something in his column

538
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,240
so he was able to deflect sorta what we
what would have

539
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,820
sends out for Spartan tell us yes
something is mislabeled and a

540
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,679
songs with what that we're able to
looked at their four-game processes that

541
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,190
and the way they were sort of the
relationship between them again

542
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,370
indicated a plugin

543
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,770
I'm Flash plugin more am

544
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,370
30 minutes is that them for some reason
the

545
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,439
the memory usage of the if the process
is in view which is interesting in it

546
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,770
it's on spout half gigabyte which is
huge that tells us that there's some

547
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,030
former spring exploit going on since
another leak

548
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,550
I'm and also just this the position of
the scroll bar on the crime when they

549
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,770
I'm shows at this and some on the show
and content and

550
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,990
that's causing a scrollbar to appear in
and that's a was vindictive what you

551
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,930
might expect if you

552
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,340
if you've got a.m.

553
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,110
and an invisible plugin rectangle

554
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:19,020
that's so all this case conference that
well

555
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,730
yeah it's a problem not the not with the
North crime with flash

556
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,140
bot slinking back already principles you
know we're gonna call it off ok because

557
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,920
if we can help we will even that's not
necessary arcade

558
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,580
to can fix so have a simply go to this
eve

559
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,780
as and when I don't have have have it
civil

560
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,889
on a far stronger security engineer so
we we borrowed him

561
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,650
to you to go and do some work on on fast
security say on

562
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,500
and we will send him a little bit of
resorts to to help help him out

563
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,220
I say will he use about 2,000 CPU cores
to you

564
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,790
to you I'm performer fighting techniques
he

565
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,820
hit by a little earlier which is where
the

566
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,970
you sort i've what time it is

567
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,170
is in fussing with excellent code
coverage than to do that what you can do

568
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,510
is you can download a white

569
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,760
sample input files and sort of crunch
them down into a corpus of files

570
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,850
the DOM that is minimal setup files but
represents a

571
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,080
maximum code coverage you can achieve
I'm

572
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,179
and fortune a.m. button Google you can
access love

573
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,380
large-scale not just these two thousand
CPU cores but also you know

574
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,790
a copy of the Internet security

575
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,020
he it's a copy of the Internet and from

576
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,320
from the internet he extracted on

577
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,909
and many many many terabytes of flash
files

578
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,640
to perform this analysis and cool lunch
this huge set down

579
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,810
on I think the important I

580
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,149
twenty thousand files I think may have
I'm of us the inputs and I must be the

581
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,370
output sets I think maybe they're like
millions and millions of ash Barty

582
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,350
Crouch down into this

583
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,760
quite dangerous at a twenty thousand
files that represents forget code

584
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,610
coverage

585
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,850
was being a good basis for fussing am

586
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,879
anyway he sort of then use the same 2000
CPU cause

587
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,350
to crank out about a about a hundred uni
bugs um

588
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,799
in in flax and UVC work for the day be
to get this fixed

589
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,130
am also we thought well as an
opportunity to you improve after some

590
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,940
boxes of him some deficiencies that

591
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,159
sousa patch things up best week in the
short term

592
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,560
including that we believe the sample to
skate used in this exploit because it

593
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,480
was Sam

594
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,500
quite discoverable so is likely to be
the same on and

595
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,330
that was used related a confirmation
unofficially that it was

596
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,540
on I'm excited work on

597
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,699
what's known as paper fax which is long
since now and is now long since a plate

598
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,179
maybe it's been out every year it's it's
basically

599
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,460
the active bringing that the Flash
plugin site some books if the same

600
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,090
strength as the core people some books

601
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,650
with its on the on more significant
security improvements we've

602
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:59,590
we've done in multi-year lifetime if the
team

603
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,750
meso went on I am some

604
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,350
some heartening measures this is one of
those incidents

605
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,299
where I mention we have the leeway to
assertive

606
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,290
step up against the bounds of our
security team can do and and go beyond

607
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,190
it and this is missus clinton's when did

608
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,120
when a bit too far I know enthusiasm to
respond and we actually am

609
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,190
we actually regressed functioning
regressed the

610
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,950
the Flash plugin crime on in quite
amusing way if it's possible to you

611
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,930
knowingly people in an amusingly

612
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,629
what happened -ism we put a limit on
something

613
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,110
call called g8 pages to try and a try
and explain potential

614
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,430
and I when that when the limit hit which
we think thought it would not do

615
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,970
we popped up and what happened as a
little dialogue box will pop up

616
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,319
I'm with the extreme a bad idea any
which is a bit cryptic but we recognize

617
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,120
it right

618
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,109
and was a need it's not recognizing it
when people started blogging this

619
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,960
strange dialogue was appearing

620
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,190
if when they were just trying to um
distracted

621
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,820
do something in flash so we met the back
of that is them

622
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,380
and then yes that's the that's a bad
idea in in hex

623
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,580
am sorry if you if you saw that

624
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,569
and finally um go get it more to this
but we invited the community turns

625
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,180
around paid on fashion's well by

626
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,259
by bringing Adobe Flash into under the
umbrella for reward system

627
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,380
so if you want to if you find a facebook

628
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,300
on for free send it to us and you may
get him monthly award if it

629
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,560
this significant for security

630
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,850
yeah gay so next difference so

631
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,390
I'm security number zero sum game so
that some

632
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,560
a statement a different size I suppose
the difference is that we genuinely

633
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,480
believe

634
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,180
security is not a zero-sum game which is
to say

635
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,629
let's look at the traditional view of
security on you know if you think

636
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,280
securities

637
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,910
zero-sum game you think that you can
wind security expensive others you know

638
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,799
by

639
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,450
by by doing something and not sharing it
and saying any we have this protection

640
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,649
or you might its she security as just a
PR game you know well

641
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:13,400
would you say I was in ER maybe it maybe
it'll mail settings mine sent same

642
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,700
and some companies um collaboration

643
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,990
me even in the security space for
collaboration he's gone important may

644
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,319
even be

645
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,320
discouraged filtered or even outright
jazz band

646
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,060
because I'm is I because of concerns
about confidentiality maybe

647
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,620
is there a different way of doing things
well yes for say I'm

648
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,600
we do in the teen Kasia aberration
openly and freely on security features

649
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,670
and standards can have a few standards
working on

650
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,060
just just about final call it the IETF
level I think for

651
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:51,190
for certificate certificate authority
related harming

652
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,370
redo like it when we can share
experiences and approaches such as this

653
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,109
talk with

654
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,360
with other vendors and even since making
source project I'm

655
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,930
we have elective share no code if any
wants to become come borrow

656
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:07,230
welcome to do so we've had several
projects are some of us on Boxing Day

657
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,890
and this one um surprises people perhaps
the most

658
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,089
on on this area but we we actively
support to any employees

659
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,540
want researching on Google

660
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,020
products even if they want to know what
time

661
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,060
to an example where this this make sense
and someone benefit

662
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,049
mention that we've a little fuzzy on the
structure and a lot of CPU resource

663
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,270
we can dedicate that say once you've got

664
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,340
the infrastructure running against Inc
browser a like friend our brother

665
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,970
justly fairly trivial to briefly point
these two thousand Cebu cause a

666
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,020
security fury at any other browser me
sort from time to time do that

667
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,690
and is just because easy to do and
because

668
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,440
that results in quite a few bugs against
all other browsers themselves and

669
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,580
there's a long service

670
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,640
you know so the whole web get safer so
we definitely believe our security is

671
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,970
concerned

672
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,569
the whole the whole arm not a zero-sum
game

673
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,400
and he says is that a a rising tide
lifts all boats that if we can make the

674
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,420
web safer for everyone across all
processing technologies

675
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:14,090
and people use the web more now that's
that's good for us as a company

676
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:20,210
next different so I removed the
middleman

677
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,160
say depending on a

678
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,220
bingham which i'm talking about.
Security Response

679
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,250
is done can be done very differently

680
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,000
how we do it so i made an attempt at
trying to diagram for more traditional

681
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,900
wasting secure response same to creep on
from the internet I like

682
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,600
drew a blank actually so had to draw on
myself and my my

683
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,960
a meeting in hex much ink has a pretty
bad apologize for the stated this

684
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,620
diagram leaving so if you can

685
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,120
you can read it attempt at a flow chart
a how

686
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,600
how secure response often works on

687
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,560
so arson run-through like this process a
bit pretending I'm a security

688
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,830
researchers is found about him

689
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm according to a company offering
something like this

690
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,470
feel free to raise your hand if this
sounds familiar to an expensive at any

691
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,250
time that an

692
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,970
anyway so who I found about I'm gonna
reported

693
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,450
writing today so I sandbagging an ass
and you know

694
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,529
and immediate got an email back this is
awesome

695
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,150
well is an automated reply just let or
somebody you know says that

696
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,570
you know it says it says we take
security very seriously I'm

697
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,980
more fired up now and a day later I get
a

698
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,500
question yeah some clarification on how
to reproduce the the park perhaps a

699
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,370
an email back and I get an email back at
a time when we think we've worked out

700
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,230
after the fuses same

701
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,410
annexing happens internally maybe it's a
fairly tricky part in that the

702
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,870
organization he is responsible for
church

703
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,410
a security people but I think
necessarily in essay expert in all the

704
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,850
main so they they bounces back over to
their internal

705
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:58,310
expert team which is a central resource
who then

706
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,320
has more questions so that saddam
bounces back through the response

707
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,610
organization to me

708
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,950
I found these questions and then
eventually

709
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,299
internally the the bug sent over and
filed with me

710
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,910
product team to may or may not have

711
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,670
some questions again they make consults
internal security experts on how best to

712
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,770
fix something

713
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,890
particularly if it's not just about for
the design level floor

714
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,750
am internally them at a three-way
disagreement may kick off on

715
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,710
on the severity of the buck the and
other products in the verses the

716
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,340
Securities view this is what I

717
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,680
claimed as a researcher on

718
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,919
and so on and so forth so you know week
later

719
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,170
sizes in 10 lines and I sent us an email
saying hey what's up

720
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,390
yeah we get this fixed so you know

721
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,770
the responsible for that price support
team for a status update and sort of

722
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,380
feel threatened send it back to me and
so on and so forth so

723
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,870
a lot of communication going on what
I've failed to draw on this diagram is

724
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,540
perhaps a big red line

725
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,080
that was the top of the diagram across
so the top couple boxes

726
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,190
and the point having I any get
visibility into you

727
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,210
a very small part of the process an
order this of internal

728
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:14,320
discussion about the book I found is
hidden hidden from view for me

729
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,880
so Mike why be the problems operating in
this order mana

730
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,090
one is just latency so

731
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,990
I'm justices round trips going on
between people that I get to see any

732
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,580
get involved with you know they it seems
that you know I I won't get

733
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,700
status update as often as I might I'm

734
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,319
you know just everyday thats that this
latest against that's it that's a day

735
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,240
that the

736
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,390
to take it sort of the to fix gets
kicked out like users will

737
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,359
will get fixes later we think because
this them significant potential and I

738
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,260
have personally

739
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,590
for lost in translations it's where

740
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,880
it's where you sort of have this middle
man whose is your serve case officer:

741
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,040
if you like a understand security not
maybe perhaps as much as as the

742
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,430
is the technical person he's actually
working how to fix the thing and

743
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,730
you know having a conversation with a
technical person you having a

744
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,120
conversation with is this middleman see

745
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,410
be quite cumbersome sometimes am yes

746
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,649
makes our top 10 discussion sometimes
I'm significantly a I'm big on

747
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,310
collaboration and I think

748
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,180
the sort of the past if the process that
I needed to you don't see a lot of the

749
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,390
discussions going on regarding the back
meanie conserve

750
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,390
chime in and help am some bugs specially
designed over bugs

751
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,670
con hearts to come up with a a good
thick sometimes that's

752
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,210
the debate secured all saying it doesn't
break the world so

753
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,790
sometimes being able as the research to
be involved in the discussion how to fix

754
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,140
something

755
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,990
is nice so we think we've removed the
middle man how does how does it work

756
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,680
how much something me different so
report about against crime

757
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,730
you go to a bug tracker and

758
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,380
public the public the access for me on
the internet bug tracking you fight

759
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:50,730
about

760
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,480
and one of the options is this is a
security about will talk to you know I'm

761
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,730
will restrict you from public and May 25
if I S

762
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,650
and then we find that the more
interesting bucks reported by the

763
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,810
the morning sting researchers used on
the same day

764
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,230
like this a three-way Austin high-energy
exciting conversation kicks off at

765
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,120
on as in the bug tracker on between the
person who sends buck

766
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,609
between remember if the prime security
team

767
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,750
and a perhaps the also the engineer
who's really the best to fix this issue

768
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,970
and came back from a variety principles

769
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,160
that the engineer fixing the issue in
the crime security team member and a lot

770
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,029
of situations water make that the same
person

771
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,230
and a on this blog additional experts in

772
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:44,700
in the area on the cake base to see seed
to keep the conversation going

773
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,529
so does lead to Salem though it's
definitely latency

774
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,310
so on occasion we've had about coming
and the same day we've landed a fix

775
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,880
and take place that's not the same as is
going to fix these are for same day

776
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,320
because that would involve

777
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,360
rushing something without queuing and
waiting do that but

778
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,750
but I i some the same day fixes that we
do inspire people to

779
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,850
to comment in the bug tracker you know
as fast and then we

780
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:12,420
and you know Nexus smile when we see
things like

781
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,230
am I justice can be the bug tracker for
fast and in a

782
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,540
find boats bikes with this this is this
occurred

783
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,450
and his last but this just popped up
here and he and his Republican

784
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,700
commitment 'cause

785
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,250
on this is an example of where the the
researcher was a sort of

786
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,350
bounce ideas of -ism we bounced ideas of
him

787
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:35,910
you know on on the best way to fix fixed
the bug in question and we came up with

788
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:36,830
something that people were

789
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:41,080
I was happy with and then we fixed it um

790
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,160
I think our table turnaround time that
was about five days in the sixties is

791
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,200
which

792
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,350
when always a fasting as a a fortune
Constanza

793
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,660
recycle time in the states that that I
am

794
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,259
this process you can be very late see to
the system

795
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,920
and then of course we I'm Gator jonsman
a monetary reward

796
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,230
at the end of things

797
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,280
be transparent am

798
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,160
so we have sort of an advanced i guess
im being able to those projected that

799
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,710
were fundamentally transform but I think
there are some

800
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,310
transparencies that that companies with
closed source products could engage in

801
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:20,009
that today said requiring open source

802
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:24,770
so in if you're not being transparent

803
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,060
how much you behave well of in my
dealings with with vendors I often find

804
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,980
the

805
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,700
it feels like communication with me is
minimized to the bad things a book

806
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,500
he said I've thought long and hard about
why this could be

807
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,170
and I may be that I just think made
maybe the many companies are concerned

808
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,250
anything they may say extending my and
getting quoted and

809
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,940
with which it might I'm my and

810
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,820
some you story perhaps I don't know say

811
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,270
perhaps as some sort of fate of pounds
going on in the risk of saying too much

812
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,820
versus the risk if

813
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:05,030
limiting coverage may not saying very
much its

814
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,250
not been comes back I'll definitely when
you find bugs internally

815
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,720
to the company you you'll keep them
secret

816
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,839
you fix in the course but you when you
do say USA announced that the bug has

817
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,930
been fixed

818
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,589
and that's pretty relating to the fact
that you have %um a setback for the fix

819
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,050
a few announce the fix against

820
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,110
the latest frightening you'll be
expected to backport it

821
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,390
some this or the lack of transparency
might be considered considered dangerous

822
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,640
for security

823
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,290
I'm and when you do announced something
fixed

824
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,620
some this does mean time check on

825
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,009
allow I'm minutes left

826
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,900
say you may find that out when when you
I'm it doesn't answer his critics

827
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,090
announce

828
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,240
I'm it in very broad a specific terms
and they went

829
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,379
doing us a shadowy full rip me original
report the course

830
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,490
fix so

831
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,799
is there if my doing things well yes we
can say say we mention that

832
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,070
all of report about to see this file a
bug tracker

833
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,770
but I am that's just the start say all
of us carry bags attract

834
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:19,130
you know public contractor and that
includes stuff we find internally

835
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:23,150
and reedy weary really do enjoy making

836
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,060
all security bugs after some suitable
period of time for the public's you can

837
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,440
go back and look at the history

838
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,730
any security bug in the history of the
product

839
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:35,040
and read them of course that sometimes
we delayed

840
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,450
opening the but the public view because
love the code we use shared with

841
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:42,040
with other products that wasn't take the
Tampa Bay

842
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,750
I'm will be saved bug tracker box but I
think every if you have a big impact on

843
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,660
crime security

844
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,660
its movies about its really is a
conversation

845
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,920
any sort of see aberration going on and
you can see discussions about how the

846
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,280
fix should be

847
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,300
should be implemented you see their
search for jumping in from time to time

848
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,100
is reported as the bug

849
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,460
heehee native had stabbed at something
and helpers in the

850
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,140
senator transparency that lets us do
that

851
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,920
and I don't know I'm a people that do
this but uniqueness me historical gems

852
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,840
available now but they do say so

853
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,120
for example we have a competition format

854
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,819
comment call premium where we actually
for lots of money require people to

855
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,160
actually

856
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,460
ex white boxes that is fine bugs and

857
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,830
course the principal transparencies
dictates that the full working expertly

858
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,130
did work at some point in time is just
there's an attachment

859
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,900
go back and look at those and

860
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,160
and study them and learn from them we

861
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,710
eyepiece that some people do you go in
and studies expertise

862
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,450
right papers on the techniques used in
someone so like he's about the

863
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:55,279
collaboration is encourage that

864
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,170
and the best story I could find work
demonstrates why transparency with is a

865
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,850
huge win for us is just some other bug

866
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:05,339
the numbers are random number B its
public you can read it

867
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,060
what actually happens is we have
researchers and is above its a very good

868
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,440
book

869
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,700
I'm we fix it and

870
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,140
immediate within a day or two the
researcher comes back as a comment on

871
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,270
the back and what he says hi and you
fixed it

872
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:21,770
properly is this serves corn a case that
still seems to work

873
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:25,170
and what that enable us to do that
trance and of course transparencies or

874
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,300
18 with him to tell us that I'm what
saved us the pain of is it's a just the

875
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,780
pain of sort of

876
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,140
fixing the bug releasing and then coming
saying it's not fixed

877
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:38,299
an outing kinda embarrassing you know
anything exit security but probably

878
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,620
asylum

879
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,400
but what he needs to do is get it right
get it right the first time

880
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,910
is awesome and of course we with them
probably doubled his reward

881
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:54,069
as well as counts wings comes to bugs
modest you twice as much for your help

882
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:57,630
I'm freebie for you know the story

883
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,950
the reason have this story's some people
I think

884
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,689
of mister there's a fear that
transparency will lead to the

885
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,380
possibility of attacks against you

886
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,460
like if you if you have all your dirty
laundry out there for public view that

887
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,470
the fears that someone come in

888
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,060
count how many bugs you hadn't said oh
my goodness at 70 bucks or

889
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,950
or someone saw review about database and
saying I was an awful lot

890
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,270
and maybe that stream it maybe there's a
chance that will happen but but we think

891
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,180
that the

892
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,310
the benefits open transparent
cooperation outweigh the risks of taking

893
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,730
some PR hit and actually yeah

894
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,790
to me we found that thing comes back to
me very clear positive in

895
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,890
in this recent incident so we face it
some

896
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,940
some blog post I'm related to crime re
the

897
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,670
that someone disagreed with and have to
account for opinion which is which is

898
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,860
awesome

899
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:49,720
am have the reserve frame that counter
pinions around this claim that they had

900
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,589
tons of critical crime issues that were
months old not been fixed

901
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,610
obsessive and inflammatory story might
get some traction so well look into this

902
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:03,240
only we found that actually is this is
not true there were some bugs

903
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,950
been reported that they were sort of in
our opinion on not security box

904
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,600
say there's a transparent /param to
respond by posing this link

905
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,860
which is just a aquarian of about
database for the name of the company

906
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,630
that it

907
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,120
made this claim listing all of the
things they've reported

908
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,100
enabling anyone wanted independent me
you know verify lking buses

909
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,279
that claim in the end the a in the end

910
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,080
sooo over quite more than that impacted
the block place making the claim was

911
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,870
taken down

912
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,170
handsome modified to be a little more
true say

913
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:39,430
transparency he was actually a a PR when

914
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,690
and this is the final difference on my
game

915
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,660
that's when the ones where we think is
is more significant

916
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,420
so to a story in that celebrate
community

917
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,590
so on motivation company has been known
to see the community

918
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,700
in never reports if this

919
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,870
may attempt to vilify members of the
community is a No today

920
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:06,980
see eye to eye in in a on the severity
your time line maybe if some bucks

921
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:11,850
as doesn't seem excited sifter to work
with the community

922
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,759
you may try and downplay the
significance %uh for such as research

923
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,570
and so on

924
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,090
so as a principle we found that

925
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:24,170
the morn gauge what we do with the white
communities more the more

926
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,870
or something gets a weary time and
celebrate community contributions miss

927
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,330
you can say

928
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:33,549
now we have a Hall of Fame which lists
this everyone Sun

929
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,710
got among the few of us know so as on a
the as

930
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,740
not quite cross that bob is still send
us some useful have a list of people and

931
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,979
we just ran to haiti's

932
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,560
is that list of people in there or sumn
and and with we get feedback that that's

933
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,440
helped people and jobs

934
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,540
sometimes that's actually but also with
with other companies that's that's quite

935
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,779
appreciated

936
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,990
I'm whenever we fix something that's so
important to us we

937
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,500
we declare it now release names I am

938
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,510
just respect supported the transparency
principle we saw earlier

939
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:08,640
also is more server its its eye contact
with the crimes gettin is also

940
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,080
less mechanized and and more
individualized inhuman I say

941
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,930
when research comes to us and this is
bargain its I'm just haven't thought of

942
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,060
anything is really clever you know your
your see

943
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,509
myself one of my engine is the first
response in the buck masses

944
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,470
well this isn't or sumfin this is really
clever have anything to this

945
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,990
and we just fine that's a one on one
researcher to research interactions

946
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,209
I'm gets little respect on both sides of
course we celebrates

947
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:38,540
completions financially on on about
basis

948
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,480
just because we can sometimes we decided
on someone's been so awesome I'll just

949
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,060
issue a surprise monetary water them
like sort of a

950
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,520
like a best of the best for the year
kinda for what may be

951
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,930
knows only get something sent us this
very spectacular

952
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:59,169
will often do a write up ourselves as a
celebration of the quality of the work

953
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,580
some of the pentium entries we've
received we've actually written them up

954
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,279
and publish them on a official Google
Blog to celebrate the sexes achievement

955
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,520
I'm said this is the next couple of
slides are not

956
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,880
not new rewards but just this is just to
illustrate that sometimes we just

957
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,080
this last year we just randomly decided
to give cover photo reporters an extra

958
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,790
ten thousand dollar top up this way unit
working with them

959
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,120
and setting us up for some stuff say a
couple slides for presentation I did

960
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,700
last year oh it's just

961
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,980
well just give these to or some people
ten thousand dollars each yes as a top

962
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,900
up to the

963
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,390
other wards

964
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,609
so that ends part 1 members can do
exactly and check again with Allie

965
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:42,490
see how much time to outside party won't
guarantee

966
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,709
five to 10 minutes K people

967
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,910
infused to go into some more detail in
our war program

968
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,460
all and I wanna wants I'm

969
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,030
what I then c2c

970
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,080
so this is the story of people's history
with rewards

971
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,850
this is where we when we get good
security reports him what we'll do is

972
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:03,759
we'll

973
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,630
will financially compensate such as the
defender state awards

974
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:13,700
I'm so we'll start with with the
statistics that people are you most

975
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,529
excited about which is of course

976
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,590
while how much he I'm to be paid in
Table

977
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:22,630
as the first question you get and a some
breaking news or at least it was new on

978
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,160
Monday

979
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,259
with a blog post about this I'm

980
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,350
when our to you million USD across our
various war programs

981
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:34,029
crossed across that bar and
interestingly enough I speak down almost

982
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,440
equally a million each

983
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,640
from this or chrome pony im side of
things and the Google

984
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,220
website side of things and I suppose I
should admit it internally there

985
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,390
as a bit of competition to get a million
dollars first

986
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,960
and I was reading for crime and I lost
but I week

987
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,270
we crossed a million dollars just just
after am

988
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:59,640
and doesn't bugs as well for that money
is back two thousand bags across

989
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,600
everything

990
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,410
slight psyche skewed in favor of more
bugs on the website of things

991
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:07,710
public's because you have a lot more web
sites you think and maybe a little

992
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,810
easier to find

993
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,070
certain classes of weapon ability than
it is to find memory corruption in a

994
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,360
browser

995
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,540
and as the book basically put out about
that

996
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,270
that small

997
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:25,350
glitch K um every time I talk about or
was program

998
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:28,950
the goal with the changes the talk
changes so

999
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,990
at first the call the talks to say hey
we've done something a bit different a

1000
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,970
little bit crazy was gonna tell you how
it went

1001
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,549
just share share our story and now

1002
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,590
overtime things change dramatically

1003
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,340
we now give these talks try and tell
people

1004
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,620
just engaging the community in his ways
is just one hundred percent

1005
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,759
fully positivism source emits exceeded
our wildest expectations and

1006
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,480
and you should launch a vulnerability or
program

1007
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,550
if you make sense and their couple love

1008
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:03,880
caveats we give this a one is a you must
have yet so if you

1009
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,230
if you or your company responsible for
software which is sort of

1010
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,540
local front line in the mail fight say
you know installed on

1011
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:14,380
a white percentage of the world's
computers or part of critical

1012
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,000
infrastructure

1013
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,240
you know the world depends on me it
sounds dramatic

1014
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,410
that but the world does depend on if
you're in that position and

1015
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:25,080
on way you can make your Posterous que
possa batters to have a role program you

1016
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,150
should

1017
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,270
but before you do that you wanna have a
mature

1018
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,290
STL in place like this for war program
is its

1019
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:36,420
not a substitute for not bothering with
security and in fact we have other

1020
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,020
security in order will program probably
or be overwhelmed say you need to have

1021
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,780
your response organization

1022
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:47,140
so funny chain WellStar using

1023
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,240
so the history about bounties I'm

1024
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,470
best we can trace it back we think
that's jonsman you may have heard of

1025
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,520
buying a

1026
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,040
Donald Knuth may have kicked his whole
thing off in 1981

1027
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,640
I'm in a slightly different way but he
found a acquits bug in his book

1028
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,670
he would send you a check I'm

1029
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,400
I know is and when he got a gotta frames
check Donald

1030
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,890
on their wall you do I i you get a hit
in a in a crowd like this

1031
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,810
excellent and then of course the first

1032
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:19,299
significant vendor to do this was
probably netscape back in 95

1033
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,230
when estate became is Ella they carry
that on in 2004

1034
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,530
and so on and so on and as you can see
that this autumn packing density is

1035
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,510
these program launches

1036
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,460
getting more dense this week it was
Martin time and that is more more

1037
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,810
is more more to love fact-based

1038
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,130
this more more facts and a top this is a
guide ACC normal

1039
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:43,170
doing it sensor is slightly some very
old

1040
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:46,430
other on small companies you've probably
heard of it dived into this game because

1041
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,520
it works lol

1042
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,160
including most recently Microsoft ISV
dip their toe in the water and i think

1043
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,109
thats

1044
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,220
that's fantastic because they they sort
of count on a

1045
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,689
on on this summer these goals here they
they definitely count on being front

1046
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,670
line in the fight against my USA

1047
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,110
it done this is awesome some history

1048
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:07,490
I'm I think will skip

1049
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,850
skip the sites were alone time but I
this is just showing how we overtime

1050
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,540
with racks

1051
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,830
it up the reward levels and in some way
you can see these will programs as an

1052
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,190
economy

1053
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,280
over time it gets harder to find bugs
and

1054
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,400
so what you want to do perhaps if you're
serious about these programs is

1055
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,190
as the incoming reportable trickles down
is getting harder he served gives big

1056
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,900
not be content with his

1057
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,440
in a max payouts it ended up in that we
made these people so

1058
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,590
see found every time we've done quite a
few

1059
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,030
quality reward increases another
question gotti's

1060
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,170
you know what is it what it looks like
when you launch a program this is the

1061
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,500
crime launch

1062
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:49,280
I'm that he launched and I think Jan
2009 at the beginning of the graph so

1063
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,630
in terms have months collapse when a
pretty slow do

1064
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:56,450
ramp up for people and I engaging with
us

1065
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:00,040
on it wasn't immediately it did happen
eventually say

1066
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,970
maybe that's a reflection of the fact
that research in a browser can be quite

1067
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:03,549
are

1068
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,960
need to serve invest a lot of time to
learn a lot about a possible for you

1069
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,580
necessary

1070
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,819
diving in attacking

1071
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,780
since on his dick poon Mr

1072
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,310
competition format I'm so

1073
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:21,570
to dipped out on the water by by
sponsoring

1074
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:26,200
top of the water cram into industry
competition in 2011

1075
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,220
and iraq has a misunderstanding so I'll
just launch are in competition

1076
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,569
we've we've try to calibrate things
again

1077
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,730
looking at this is an economy we try to
calibrate insist reward was high enough

1078
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,640
that someone was

1079
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,870
short enter and got it just right got
because men trees

1080
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,799
so gentleman by the name of Pinkie Pie
one sixty thousand dollars

1081
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,840
for the second competition and that is
like a

1082
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:57,190
Pentium three I in quite the full price
be turned up in and took a forty

1083
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,550
thousand dollar when

1084
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:03,800
on and the first only had he turned up
for a sixty thousand dollar win is

1085
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,590
getting a bit he's at this time say

1086
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,870
he said a benchmark one day if we run a
penny in competition and he doesn't show

1087
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,509
up the collected sixty thousand dollars
you know

1088
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,930
madame really solid shape because this
guy's amazing

1089
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:18,240
am and skip that

1090
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,959
say just to humanize the whole pay in
competition

1091
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,290
is something something mean may say that
that's me with with shorter hair

1092
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:30,110
directly shit this is and this is that a
tense moment around the desk where

1093
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:33,540
sums turned up and they like I can do
this I i've got this

1094
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,320
website when you visit it's that well
compromise crime in a my sixty thousand

1095
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,570
dollars avon's

1096
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:42,740
all eyes on the laptop you may notice as
a guy

1097
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:46,839
um so that in the background to the
right hand side and has a look at

1098
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,570
abject terror on its face and if you can
CA

1099
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,120
there he's next terrified and the reason
for that is

1100
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,400
them we actually had in this competition
we actually had

1101
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,760
the Adobe Flash plugin in scope Anna and
this

1102
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,950
gentleman is an employee ever date me
and

1103
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,270
known quite news what's gonna go down
yet so this is thought he's three

1104
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:12,520
thinking oh my god the same be a flash
but just just

1105
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,480
just a and it wasn't so I Z I have the
picture to prove it is looking a bit

1106
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,510
happier about five minutes later

1107
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,750
I'm say we we you know I thought to be
about how is it that some successes we

1108
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,310
also

1109
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,690
something when poking fun at ourselves
if we if we fail so

1110
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:30,350
the the penny into sixty thousand dollar
win

1111
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,350
um involve two pieces have attack
against crime like a

1112
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,589
difficult piece I'm to

1113
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,820
sorta breaking the kind and any though
the way this gentleman think my break at

1114
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,970
the same box

1115
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,430
was just too easy by us and recesses
high standards and we went we were

1116
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,910
well very happy with it of course we
your best foot forward to make some

1117
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,930
changes to make correction happen again
but in a

1118
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:55,460
I'm we definitely and a double facepalm
from performance ever

1119
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,840
we're at the same box as he found a way
for within the some books to request the

1120
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,870
privilege context you just right

1121
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,549
this sequence of bytes to this file
name: just not have a good

1122
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,460
property having any samples am and it
was so bad we we just went

1123
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,950
demean town with this in SI

1124
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,250
you know member Trust I was gonna trust
the final aim

1125
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,460
to file past and the content of the file
it's a great

1126
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,170
say long since fixed and the sale went
II

1127
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:27,810
went on an internal audit rampage to
make those no in other instances of this

1128
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:28,490
happen

1129
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,069
but that's what we did the pain in
competitions not the value they provide

1130
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,250
to be

1131
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,040
you really wouldn't have found out about
this if we haven't done this you know

1132
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,120
60,000 best sixty thousand dollars with

1133
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,299
weaves have a spending problem

1134
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,940
just shoddy meter stop just beef it's
going to the other main

1135
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:50,470
reward program Google Web program more
contentious because this is the first

1136
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,810
time we know of that a large corporation

1137
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:56,200
is gonna put up security I'm rewards

1138
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,480
relative to 'em live production website
is there's no other

1139
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,720
good way to to do it really say you know
you have to talk to you legal people

1140
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,520
forty budget people have to get by in
from thousands of teams as I've said it

1141
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,750
is one product team

1142
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,880
I'm the most interesting thing people
want a ride is is legal

1143
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,130
am lawyers or sumn it turns out that if
something's illegal

1144
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:18,160
you can't make it not a legal just by
writing a blog post I mean

1145
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,310
if the world if that will work like that
I think we did

1146
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:25,009
see its we see a lot of trouble in love
love pastes

1147
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:28,820
am say you're the sort of see don't lose
basically the right to go of the

1148
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,560
criminal activity by having a bounty
program is this the principal

1149
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,570
um also as long as you have

1150
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:38,990
clearly-defined do this do not do that
in a wat

1151
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:42,549
you're so dang think lose the ability to
chase people civilians they

1152
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:46,170
reading try to damage am

1153
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:51,090
so eagerly actually turns out I i he
sort of a headache but it does just fine

1154
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,200
am I'm for this launch we formed a
formal

1155
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,210
Warren like to have our finger readies
gonna blog post saying hey

1156
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:04,480
think about single web sites Amaral sat
on a warm

1157
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,260
and we don't know what's gonna happen so
we had a sweepstake on me but getting

1158
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,250
first 24 hours and eyes and I and maybe
a few

1159
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:16,160
hand I lost I

1160
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,029
I lost to someone who sets something
like yeah

1161
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:24,400
maybe maybe if f you may be maybe I'm
will look at a graph in it

1162
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,400
states that so I'm quickly the
eligibility

1163
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,350
before you launch party you won't be you
wanna publicly document

1164
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:36,250
very clearly what is not scope to avoid
any misunderstandings

1165
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,680
said that I'm

1166
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,020
we actually exempt acquisitions for six
months

1167
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:47,220
after we acquire them because when you
acquire acquisition and

1168
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,850
they may not necessarily have the same
security posture you do so

1169
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:53,740
yet we think it's reasonable for us to
holders of the standard beating them

1170
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,259
into shape within six months

1171
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,970
challenges were worried about a few
things before launch

1172
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:03,100
my going to these cue thank you like but
I'm

1173
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,529
known as these challenges always came to
be

1174
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:11,740
came to be true so describes it we press
the buttons

1175
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,790
can you tell at what point in the time
on this graph we launched the war

1176
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:17,890
program

1177
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,200
and I can actually save it as a race
this is this is this a wise guy

1178
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,930
holders up of being relative but a

1179
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:28,009
you can see this is this the graph above
box file duty

1180
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:32,660
external reports week and this %uh
villain a small drivel the bugs coming

1181
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,759
in the first few weeks represented on
the far bottom after the graph and then

1182
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:42,170
bang that's me losing my like that Anna

1183
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:45,910
so without a great night is that it's
easier to immediately dive in and do

1184
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:46,339
some

1185
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,340
website security assessment is to browse
a research

1186
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,220
another takeaway is in a if you do this
you want your response organization

1187
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,230
primed and ready

1188
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:57,290
for you want it wanted overstaffed such
that the spec

1189
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,830
nasty beyond the current level you're
handling

1190
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:04,680
to sort of put some numbers on that
spike tacit

1191
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,649
ten times biking coming up or strapping
on

1192
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:11,700
nor a magnitude-7

1193
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,629
it's quite interesting um it then
settled down a bit

1194
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,710
to a five times late for several months
and

1195
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:22,620
we think it's that he stated about three
times the load of what historically was

1196
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,609
which is in a much more manageable

1197
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:27,839
I'm just a shady

1198
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,219
graph illustrating some the economies of
the situation

1199
01:08:31,219 --> 01:08:34,600
this is of the old now twenty first
launch he sorta

1200
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,270
had led us to come in and then it's a
drops off in I mathematically model this

1201
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,820
is probably am

1202
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:44,319
probably a a property maps for
exponential decay perhaps I don't know

1203
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,130
but it shows you that I am

1204
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:50,420
you want to program and he's fine bucks
relative and then over time it gets hot

1205
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:54,730
bucks and that's when you might consider
something up for awards

1206
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:59,069
with us what type of what I'm bucks will
find a XSS

1207
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:02,889
which is the blue chunk is a percentage
dominates number external ports which is

1208
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,410
free no surprise to those view

1209
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:08,559
researched all Minister web sites

1210
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,620
this is gone cool when we launched the
war programs of us he is

1211
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,899
initially was that well we really love
working with community

1212
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:20,099
so the reward programs a thank you for

1213
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,240
for working d %ah but

1214
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:28,149
turns out having a row program will
attract new researchers in fact

1215
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:32,219
about 85 percent of people's many bugs a
new verses 15

1216
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:35,960
percent for such as that used to work
with before the program

1217
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,859
University um any 31 6 percent usa-based

1218
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:44,049
the reporters stunning in person go into
more detail

1219
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:47,700
we have significant University Justin
randomness countries if much we've had

1220
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,630
people

1221
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:52,380
come to us from I thought Finland
involved because there's just something

1222
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,310
about finland's

1223
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:58,410
I don't have in Finland's so

1224
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:02,760
now I can't delegate count the audience
but a on the crime program

1225
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,100
if every moment turned up the three
people from know it turned up from

1226
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,550
finland not really known each other just
the random

1227
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:12,060
I'm a native Finland and deserve man and
tore the house up

1228
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:16,300
you know register made a lot of money
and send some more sandbags Finland

1229
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,380
I'm missed you have to remain unsold I
guess

1230
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:26,040
I'm how charitable the

1231
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,780
moving on its say air

1232
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:34,030
the results you get an immediate you get
an immediate spike in reports

1233
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,719
%uh the signal to noise ratio is better
than we thought we thought we were gonna

1234
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,410
get some people who only had a profound
understanding of security

1235
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,730
come to us tryin I'm trained

1236
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:46,799
make money for fan on security issues
I'm

1237
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,950
you really get a coverage that you just
don't get it yet

1238
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:53,160
your internal security net save an
internal security number and save

1239
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:57,460
even something big like a hundred how
can you compete with you know that

1240
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,920
tens of thousands of security
researchers around the world both in

1241
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,640
terms of Brett coverage

1242
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,000
but also in terms of GES down just just
sorta

1243
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,750
thank you for the corner cases say
you're getting some really clever stuff

1244
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,700
if you if you want to the wider
community

1245
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,019
I'm getting some fun but is also this
this with someone other

1246
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,160
for me serious security but I never seen
I'm

1247
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,400
so this gentleman claim the issuance
transito

1248
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,750
transit would give a common specifically
trying to transition Portuguese to

1249
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:29,120
Spanish in specifically typing a long
sequence apiece

1250
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:36,120
security bug is sounds just like a
helicopter

1251
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,720
I at I

1252
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,350
I was on the rewards panel for the
weapon I'm I voted to reward him just

1253
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:44,110
the

1254
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:47,530
being awesome um II was

1255
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:51,090
I was shot down by simpson more some
other members of the panel on

1256
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,750
apps upset my own like the a like the

1257
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,970
like the icon I've been using earlier
today yes

1258
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm not sure we fix that neither in
which is a very bad response times came

1259
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,300
in

1260
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,830
several years ago so summery positives
um

1261
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:12,290
say it's not objectify

1262
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,960
how how much more secure email users but
any good where we found

1263
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,280
doing it is some we talk to the people
he send a steak is regularly

1264
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,120
and we decide have seen every month or
we haven't seen for a while saying a is

1265
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,490
getting harder and I yes

1266
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:29,120
its very hard now i know i in fact going
to

1267
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,260
spend my time doing something else it's
a hot so you know the

1268
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,900
if you don't from these programs it you
really can so flush out the

1269
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,549
or the qualities bugs that your normal
security process my

1270
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:43,350
missed everyone's human we all we all
miss security bugs I'm

1271
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:49,970
taking a thinking about the darker side
of our industry we from

1272
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,060
we've actually a few months back I was
verified we've had what we call

1273
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,920
collisions

1274
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,830
so that's where Whitecap researcher his
intent is to make the weapon

1275
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:01,410
the world a safer place ascent is about
we fixed it and that is

1276
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,300
collided or stepped on the toes a more
nefarious intent

1277
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:09,280
you know someone who all sonya is a bug
going back to the early a comic

1278
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,960
and goodness is a day with it but you
know by May 28 in the community

1279
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,290
as a has to step up here you know
yesterday making SBS

1280
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:19,590
a dent in the dark side of the industry
am

1281
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:23,130
nowadays is just a reflection of the
fact that since we launched the program

1282
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:23,780
was not ready

1283
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:27,190
had someone drop it Google access are

1284
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:31,990
you know is to have people sale all on
the Lexus estimates come with a fix it

1285
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,620
I'm now it turns out that yeah few
thousand dollars is

1286
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,890
more fun and posting a message for

1287
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:43,310
rated as the new people

1288
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:47,530
we've actually hired a bunch of people
specifically through introductions made

1289
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:48,580
on a wall programs

1290
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:52,130
I'm out of here security hires is always
difficult so

1291
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:57,370
really he's not that aspect
cost-effective

1292
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:01,030
there's a paper by dev was presented
earlier conference

1293
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:04,530
try to to the objectify some of the
cost-effectiveness

1294
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,130
which is awesome cuz we display my hands
in the air and say it's really cost

1295
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:08,730
effective

1296
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:12,750
and anti-china and the paper comes up
with some figures like maybe

1297
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:16,640
maybe a be ten times more cost effective
than other ways of getting the same

1298
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,160
results

1299
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:22,730
and so on apps

1300
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:26,450
negatives

1301
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:29,950
of launching the program I mean it

1302
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:33,290
specific and slide right but I i we've
racked our brains trying

1303
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:39,910
think I've any I'm wrong and it's just
all good just so the

1304
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:42,990
hope said from the stage it is not as me
rounding up here

1305
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:45,990
I'm others to have jumped into the

1306
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:50,719
into his reward game in positive on same
ranging from the payout CISA

1307
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,410
you-know-who freely admits he had
reservations about the whole concept

1308
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,809
but then data the key word being data

1309
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:02,580
has proven him wrong say a that him to
launch their program um

1310
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:06,480
and down to the bottom XE security says
what I

1311
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,599
also believe now that you know this is
industry best practice so I think where

1312
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,250
heading right before the world by any
company who

1313
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,750
you know has significant importance of
where does not have a rich bounty

1314
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,680
program is you know is not following
industry best practice

1315
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,260
recommendations selling launch

1316
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,880
if you do want to launch on these things
you would make an invite to lunch with

1317
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,740
myself and others

1318
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,870
people who think for might wanna start
small

1319
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:35,019
if you're a bit bit nervous about the
fact that ten times like

1320
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:38,090
so you might want to launched against a
subset of your products

1321
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:42,530
am yes we've covered having a response
machinery primed and ready

1322
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:45,750
and proactive communication Watson sky

1323
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:51,020
remain respectful we recommend paying
for issues in pre-production versions if

1324
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:51,710
you suffer

1325
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:55,660
kind of obvious if you think about it
would you rather have a find a bug

1326
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,750
before you launch it to the to use as
all after he wanted two years

1327
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:05,240
and have gone over too much

1328
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:12,240
any better juncture I'd love to invite
any you may have

1329
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,180
at Allan Sherman UMBC

1330
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:24,650
how does your security team in Iraq
proactively with the design of new

1331
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:25,400
products

1332
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:30,269
on from the very beginning of the design
phase yes I have a question said

1333
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,730
question was about how we handle design
movies

1334
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:37,830
I it differs across company brought I'll
talk about my perspective on crime

1335
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:41,540
um what we do is we we have a formal

1336
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,390
launch process for new features and
security has a seat at that table

1337
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:48,440
say I want something here doing a skit

1338
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,549
you feature 12 on the team they talk a
security and

1339
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:54,860
at that time immediately look to see if
this feature

1340
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,130
you know is carries little risk if it
does then we'll

1341
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:01,140
assigns and dedicated security people to
actually

1342
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:04,190
I'm sitting on the design meetings and
be

1343
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,650
of Co offers on the design doc say that
we have confidence that

1344
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:12,179
at the design level nothing's been done
right and as I'm sure wasn't

1345
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,340
isn't this in your question if you mess
up the design level at the design level

1346
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,910
and find out about problems later as you
can in place to launch as a really

1347
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,690
horrible situation to be in because you
make may be faced with launching with

1348
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:24,530
security issues

1349
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:28,599
or also delaying months the project

1350
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,490
chris what's actor Sam

1351
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:36,599
am I think you're good neighbor policy
is a really good one so you kind of go

1352
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,960
above and beyond to solve other people's
problems

1353
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,600
a but do you get tired of solving
problems in Flash

1354
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,610
and do you reach out to Adobe to try and

1355
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,980
figure out if there's a better way to
solve that problem

1356
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,900
that's a good question so do we get
tired of at helping other people out

1357
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,230
I mean I'm yards no cuz we fully enjoy
health Wiese

1358
01:17:56,230 --> 01:18:00,530
in enjoy a finding in security bugs
especially ones that may have a positive

1359
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,750
impact not just on

1360
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,820
us now uses but the whole web on in
terms if I'm

1361
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:09,410
getting getting tired specific projects
what we

1362
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,440
what we do try and do the define or to
make such that we have

1363
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,870
computers on the task and they thing
ready get tired with humans d

1364
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:20,450
so for example some other work we're
doing on on flash

1365
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:25,269
and a lot of our internal I'm k bases we

1366
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:29,390
We have ongoing of causing that basis
based will the tech aggressions and also

1367
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,910
some tireless the flesh out

1368
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:35,639
the corner cases a bug's I'm

1369
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:39,260
America ID from the receive Utah actor
that there was a good lead and

1370
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:43,930
my question so I'm I'm active in fuzz
testing and I'm interested to learn a

1371
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:44,800
little bit more

1372
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,380
about the was testing the that you apply

1373
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:52,890
this is maybe cluster funds if we could
use a little bit more about that and

1374
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:56,970
yes us of the store you mentioned plus
the bus which is the

1375
01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:01,450
affectionate name we have for our 2000
CPU cores on

1376
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:04,950
so to be effective fuzzing we

1377
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:10,570
we find have to several things one is

1378
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:15,880
want to scale which we we think we have
covered although

1379
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,020
although there are plans TN bump up the
number

1380
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,780
computers we haven't and the second is
things picking a target say

1381
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:28,130
assertive he should have to know which
areas if your product

1382
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,760
will benefit from fuzzing if you like
and what type of housing

1383
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,890
comes as monty the third thing we do
some

1384
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:38,310
defense not simple and then get clever
so

1385
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:42,330
something for about flashvars Inc say we
start a simple

1386
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:45,650
on flash which is better than large
corpus a twenty thousand files

1387
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:49,240
mention but I'm mutations may apply to
solve

1388
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,870
the files to try and finds 3.10
particularly intelligent

1389
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:56,340
in a dose of fitting bits here and there
and see if you get crashes

1390
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:00,310
so it is not simple and sort of fuzz
heart

1391
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:04,190
until with so I've gotta love the crash
is we think we can find

1392
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:07,610
with simple thousand and them with
weekend and more creative like

1393
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:11,440
will like 1000 as understand more about
the structure of the file for months

1394
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:11,929
they can

1395
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:16,190
for mutations that some surprising to
the to the piece of cake

1396
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:19,509
positing the the former but no actual
violations a

1397
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,810
say the specification that within a
cause cause that

1398
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:27,100
the past to stop I'm and more so than

1399
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,820
so keep going in that direction we then
the gramma based buzz is that

1400
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:34,980
sort of generating thankful on existing
test cases and generate from scratch

1401
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,129
serve slightly off test miles

1402
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,240
along the lines of before the program's
expecting but

1403
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:48,099
with me a little bit surprising truant
from

1404
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,440
anything I have so I'm quite interested
in

1405
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,110
on than number of security engineers

1406
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:58,410
that are in com team

1407
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:03,300
I'm or more specifically what is the
ratio of security engineers

1408
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,290
versus the restive the team

1409
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:11,290
yes that's right questions says about
coming secured engineers we have sought

1410
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,080
a few numbers

1411
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,030
I'm fortunately where not quite a
secretive is some companies we do we do

1412
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:19,380
you got some numbers in this area said
I'm

1413
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:23,120
company-wide number scared people have
this -ism

1414
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,140
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds sent
I don't know is a percentage if

1415
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:32,240
engineers I know that there's a industry
recommendations about 1 percent

1416
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,559
I know that were significantly above
that by choice

1417
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,250
I'm in chrome maybe some more specific
details so that

1418
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:44,260
the crime security team itself its I
accounts about 20 people now

1419
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:48,050
which we think the reason be stuffed
team for just just one product

1420
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:51,640
I'm and it's not just 20 S is more than
that so we have a

1421
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,840
sigh from the twenty secure in his we
have we have

1422
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,310
experts in SSL and certificate
authorities

1423
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:01,430
you know technically on my team

1424
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:04,730
you know the 10 from the network stack
team but hundreds and that time day in

1425
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:05,570
day out is

1426
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:08,830
security-related features and pouncing
so

1427
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:14,320
maybe the time and the numbers thirty
I'm as a percentage

1428
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,580
I i think as they know the latest number
overall

1429
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,400
convention is in sight
