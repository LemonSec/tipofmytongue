1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,019
about privacy big data security

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:15,769
we covered

3
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:20,509
material the laying out some confessions
some lessons a prediction or two

4
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:23,900
I we're gonna have time for questions at
the end so this is usually a pretty

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,150
engaging topic

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,659
how technology impacts our society so up

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,829
compile them at during the talk and what
we set up quite a bit I'm at the end

8
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:36,250
to go through them I my name is in
either on

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,649
Michael said the product not X I

10
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,960
meh did not exist quickly give you I
from now love

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,079
how and where we're merging were about
the next generation big data to really

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,489
understand data supplied things within
the enterprise and across enterprises

13
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,699
I to really discover the date that you
have and

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,120
compete with that efficiently and easily
were slowly emerging at a stealth mode

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,339
company was founded almost a year ago

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,439
us a statement a lotta more interesting
things coming out about organ

17
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,439
not act up first confession I am NOT an
attorney

18
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,648
I'm an engineer I I have back on signal
processing cryptography

19
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:20,380
software I my under rousing like coins
in the ring so I'm certainly more

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,389
a geeky nerd and then-attorney although

21
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:26,798
policy really does intrigue me I started
early in my career

22
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,959
designing advanced avionics system for
launch vehicles I did a stint in about

23
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,170
10 years developing online voting
systems in the crypto protocols that

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,749
were

25
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:38,240
that are involved in that that was an
amazing ride

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,759
and now most recently I been the I was
the first few privacy officer added

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,770
hell yes i an off around their big 18

28
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,039
so a that we've been doing the last

29
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,359
for five years up which will be

30
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,020
the the crux if the talk will be talking
about what is

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,969
the personal data supplied chain I we
were at Intel is that the ended that day

32
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:01,990
to supply chain

33
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,009
we had about 20 billion public records
we saw about 30 million visitors a month

34
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:11,080
the company been around since 2003 the
company lifetime is sold about $50

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,239
million reports

36
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,770
I we powered a power now only a few
months

37
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,140
my lap ob people search for AT&T

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,179
a previously for ya who so usually for
looking for someone online

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,540
if they are very common and you can get
away with Google search

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,140
if they have a minutes or more common
we're gonna find yourself and tell you

41
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
for one of our

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,730
proper wanna their properties I you know

43
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,929
people asking joint ellios they were a

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,790
data broker which is I usually interests
have term

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,750
I I when I joined they had a Better
Business Bureau A+ rating up a nap they

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,320
were

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,489
I engaged in several investigation by

48
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,350
investigation by Attorney General across
the country by the Senate Commerce

49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,190
Committee was investigating them

50
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,200
up I had to be there

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,720
stupid or naive to jump into that but
what I really found I really thought was

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,060
that

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,030
public data is an important element
other stab with

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,620
establishing trust between people and I
felt there was a need to do it right

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,750
and I thought I could do more from the
inside an organization like that

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,760
and just throwing rocks I I

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
at them from the outside so during my
tenure we improved our better business

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,250
better business

59
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,570
your rating from a nap now B-plus I

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,090
I'm proud about the investigations are
over I

61
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,430
we've established the industry is
something that I i

62
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,930
is reputable and trustworthy I least in
some

63
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,630
eyes and but I didn't do that alone are
far from it

64
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,640
I when I first joined in Tally s I data

65
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,600
privacy listening or of our toughest
critics actually

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,739
it was a much more modest or up

67
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,720
we r look at people that we're really at
risk

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,910
for the kinda data that we provided in
an hour risk groups included folks like

69
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,420
victim

70
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,489
victims of domestic violence and elected
officials and police officers and judges

71
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,139
those are the folks are often up the
subject some stocking

72
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,228
I and and offenders would use our data

73
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,539
sometimes for odd those ill-gotten

74
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,909
or are ill purposes I

75
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,050
so I want to talk to families folks I
the first on my list was

76
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,240
the national network to end domestic
violence I victims of domestic violence

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,979
for typically stock

78
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,430
typically when and I really wanted to
understand what we can do

79
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,680
I as a provider of personal information

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,189
to these women and so I went to talk to
Cindy Southwark

81
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,009
who's an executive at the from there and
messing around and I said

82
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:56,240
what can we do better here and few
pretty straightforward get my women out

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,029
of your day

84
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,710
and I I think that was a pretty clear

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,419
directive and I think great in the
lessons about 50,000 women

86
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,770
United States that are victims of
domestic violence would give us a lesson

87
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,599
out and she went and tried to go
compiled let's

88
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,998
an she came back and women

89
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:21,270
really don't like to be on anyway that's
the last thing they want to be honest

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,740
less I said okay haven't we get my pen
and they could

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,759
login opt out the record in that kinda

92
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,870
kinda stopped that forbidden she came
back you know what really be helpful

93
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,499
why can't these women just suppressed
their

94
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:41,449
leaders contact information they don't
want to opt out their entire profile

95
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,639
Mike why because offenders will know
that the women are proactively managing

96
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,620
your profile

97
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,800
and send them even more leave your
incentive fender even more

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,020
in San under more and so

99
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,248
what would be nice if the trail
different call the most contact

100
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:02,999
mo safety sensitive information is the
contact information just like that

101
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:06,479
as a great idea I thought it was a just

102
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,378
not as a good idea for at risk group as
a good idea for our custom

103
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,819
and so I really start to cook this idea
that

104
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,800
wanna be nice to be able to have access
to your own background check and be able

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,110
to manage

106
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,889
privacy profile around your own
background check

107
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,460
and I started think about this more
deeply and then I talk to another

108
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,049
up privacy advocate side one by the name
Sally happen

109
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,409
is an anthropologist and a product
designer design

110
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,909
bill Gertz years ago as they look like
bananas and

111
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,039
so kids you know we love bananas so you
put your grandson look like a banana and

112
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,509
of course

113
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,759
over 30 for I know they were for our
boys

114
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,199
they let go birds and so I ass out what
you think a

115
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,729
you know our product like working with
same question is:

116
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:57,058
sandy and she said you know the
prominent LES

117
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:01,800
you guys are all about voyeurism and not
enough about narcissism

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,520
Mike and it's the same

119
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,599
no that's in the echo

120
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,979
show me my own background check and so

121
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,740
we did there's a site now culture Rep
dot com

122
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,770
it's a free site I you can look at your
own back on track

123
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,469
after you're properly authenticated
through a knowledge-based authentication

124
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:27,599
you can execute privacy controls on

125
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,279
on that side you can suppress the latest
contact information

126
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,869
you you something that no one I in

127
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:38,800
domestic violence community outreach
group a private meeting after by I

128
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,059
I was a really interesting idea came
from a buddy of mine

129
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:45,979
I when I started at Intelli as he looked
up is back on track in

130
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,039
the a criminal charges on his record

131
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,969
in the charge was criminal trespassing

132
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,020
as a criminal trespassing offense on my
record

133
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,318
all I did was jump the fence at a con at
a concert

134
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,379
in college somebody broke into a

135
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,860
change I said well that's how the county
reports

136
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,770
we can't we don't we can change we
change it

137
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,099
I why can you at least let me comment on
it give

138
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,860
give provide my side of the story for so
someone sees that record

139
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,960
they will know my side of the story at a
good night

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,979
we could do that and so this I like to
do that too you can actually comments 21

141
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,969
that pulls your back on track

142
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,819
well actually see your comment right
next to

143
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,300
any charges so I think

144
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,789
this is maybe a little ahead of its time
I

145
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,120
I think there's going to be more and
more up access your own information and

146
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,730
the ability to manage

147
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,750
affectively it's public information you
should have

148
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,310
a voice in I so that its perceived

149
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,530
I correctly II and I think it's your
responsibility

150
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,680
i'd to manage and and you're right your
own public data

151
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,219
so popping up 11 for looking at data
generally

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,420
up not a big surprise is a lot of it

153
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,680
I between the time in I have some you
may know this

154
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,010
from the time that the first cave people
her on wall still about 20

155
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,680
up to there's twenty exabyte up data

156
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,109
transfer credits toward moved around
that kinda thank

157
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,900
four times that was moved around created

158
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,180
stored in February this year

159
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,459
ever by more than

160
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,580
up hardest active data I wanna be
stacked with a date with personal data

161
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,830
and this is the public data supply chain
that

162
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,960
we were privy to Antalya and this is

163
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,170
sorta where the data come from and where
it goes come from three sources:

164
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,500
predominately the headwaters of the
supply chain

165
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,510
are government typically

166
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,950
vital records I property records

167
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,370
licenses things like that I

168
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,690
there's commercial record which come
from

169
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,760
businesses hi businesses that you
actually to business where

170
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,790
so when you get there really expensive
oil change

171
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,150
and you sign documents when you pay for

172
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,709
your you may be signing away the data
that you provided that

173
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,980
oil change company and it'll be sold
into this data supplied

174
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,330
the last element of this is
self-reported data that you put up and

175
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,620
blogs that you might

176
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,690
but in other public warrock I Twitter

177
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,950
Facebook if your privacy settings on
clampdown I

178
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,060
so there's a lot of data I

179
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,949
there's a analyst for the data that's in
that comes in the state supply chain

180
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,640
I and then it gets crimes together these
big data engines

181
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,480
and its use for a buncha stuff I in the
risk environment its use for

182
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,080
credit reports II and credit tax

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,710
housing employment screening marketing
behavioral targeting feeds this

184
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,800
I is fed by the state supply chain ID
background facts

185
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,780
I as well directories that Intel is
engaged in

186
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,780
people ask white

187
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,900
uses the people after this data I

188
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,740
most of them are not regulated some of
them are regulated by the Fair Credit

189
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,770
Reporting Act the most of these are not
regulated

190
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,810
I they run from the mundane to the
obscure up

191
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,900
I someone put together Union and they
wanna

192
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,140
altogether addresses the people that
they went to school with

193
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,730
up love is actually a big used for
consumer

194
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,750
background checks check out today

195
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,000
parents checking out a fiance I

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,630
is a big use pro there some profound
uses people

197
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,830
adopted kids looking up there lot their
birth parents

198
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,050
is a common you up the one that is the
most obscure i think is in

199
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:04,930
sorta 3 o'clock fine owner up dog
relative for trans

200
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,060
this actually was use up an analyst at
work for me

201
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,459
and we always when are Alice interviewed
with that we always have them

202
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,150
look at our site and give them a
critique are they would give us a

203
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,260
presentation

204
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,650
what they found with the site and she
came in to do not use the site a couple

205
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,689
years ago my dog needed a trans bone
marrow transplants when you define

206
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,330
my dog siblings we had find the owner
Mike Dogg sibling when using tell you to

207
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,450
do that

208
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,790
i'd you are our service

209
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,099
up so lots uses

210
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,190
let's talk a little bit about how we I

211
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,750
do all how do we do this linkage how do
we

212
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,180
accomplish this linkage problem up

213
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,959
we take billions records that fifteen
billion record cell

214
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,750
and we have in this inning United States
typically will

215
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,120
and we have to take billion record after
Maxim

216
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,730
to the hundreds of millions of people
United States

217
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,790
and soul ocular same name I

218
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,760
clearly Carol Brooks for example there's
about 1300 people named Karen Blixen

219
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,380
United States might have about 10,000
records

220
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,100
for people named Carol Brooks and you
have to find the right Carol Brooks

221
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
records

222
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,560
for the correct hell Brooks people I for
me

223
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,209
others about 200 records for the 35 yr
sodium Adler's

224
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,780
in in the country and so we do this
record linkage problem

225
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,180
and what comes out a bit of a cluster of
record so you see at the bottom right

226
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,400
there is this cluster

227
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,439
records and up you see the gym now for
about

228
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,890
ten o'clock that an ambulance facing
lawyer

229
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,699
from Houston Texas who is the bane of my
existence because he really punches

230
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,070
records out there and he always shows up
higher than Lauren

231
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,090
I'm I'm the lame NABARD about 8 o'clock

232
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,220
up from now Mountain View Calif

233
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,860
I so these are all this is the cluster
ball the gym abner

234
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,990
up that are that exist

235
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,980
and so these are available for purchase
at places like Antalya

236
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,300
other sites we can get these profiles

237
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,430
we also offer opt out you can opt out
not to suppress and relays contact

238
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,199
information

239
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,610
but for free you can opt out a profile
and people ask

240
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,860
when someone knocks out you delete the
record believe the profile

241
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,210
confession no we do not and there's

242
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,720
something called the fair Information
practice principles

243
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,450
that talk about data minimisation and
minimal use

244
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,560
and things like that fair use a beta and
people ask why don't you delete the data

245
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,030
I because we feel that there we
certainly suppress it

246
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,480
we certainly honor the opt-out would be
in big trouble with the Federal Trade

247
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,150
Commission

248
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,680
within on the opt-out I

249
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,089
but sometimes you can do better by not
pull the race in the day and here's an

250
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,380
example

251
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,930
so here's to record his a profile with a
few record Jane Hampton

252
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,209
from Peoria Illinois we have to record
for

253
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,280
one has our date of birth about

254
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,290
just turned 15 years old a minor

255
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,079
might ask why minor data in your in your
information

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,040
cash at all sometimes he gets in

257
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,089
I as much as we don't want date on minor
some time to get into the state supply

258
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,640
chain and

259
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,150
we don't went nowhere comes from we are
races are entices and other data brokers

260
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,720
are gracious acquires a date and
sometimes

261
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,900
data from miners getting there and so

262
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,990
we put it together we put these two
records together one records data for

263
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,500
the other records not the day to
Berkeley link them

264
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,480
you're like me then and then we would
opt out

265
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,230
because we don't serve profiles on minor

266
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,570
so then if if we did follow the data
minimisation principal

267
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,779
a affair the fam made from practice
principles

268
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:57,510
we would then a race this profile but
we've got another record the next month

269
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,370
but had no data for it was the same
Hampton Inn there's her

270
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,950
email address if we hit totally

271
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,290
a race the opt-out profile we would be
we have nothing the match against

272
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,800
wouldn't know that Hampton is a minor
and we would end up serving the profile

273
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,439
with your email address

274
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,740
however if we kept that we would now

275
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,340
have two records in a profile for a
minor

276
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,440
and the new record would snap into that
profile because we build a maximally

277
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,900
by now and now we can opt out the entire
profile

278
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,260
and now no information on vein Hampton
the minor

279
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,750
would actually leak out onto the site so
I think

280
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,870
there sometime sometimes there are
reasons why

281
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,950
you if you follow the letter from the
principal the end up delivering poor

282
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,560
service

283
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,790
and I think that's where up a little

284
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,260
innovation a little thought for a
objective

285
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,900
reasoning comes into play so that's a
little bit

286
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,920
detail on on the

287
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,630
personal data supplied let's get some
altitude on the history of this

288
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,459
I at least how I've been thinking about
it for a while

289
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,360
up while ago under fifty years ago or so

290
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,799
house are pretty small I love this Oscar
Wilde quote quote quote the only thing

291
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,000
worse than being talked about is not
being talked about in this is a a

292
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,390
painting by

293
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,079
Norman Rockwell call the gossip and II
spent about a

294
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,099
couple years my you think greensboro
alabama

295
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,490
and I think the population now 2500 I
think when I was there

296
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,730
i play like 1200 the town is small
everybody knew everybody else

297
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,930
and when you cut school the whole town
knows by dinner literally

298
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,270
dinner you cut you cut school there

299
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,480
there was the reasonable expectation of
privacy which is actually legal term

300
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,210
was very low up a friend

301
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,390
a minor op Monroe I whose was secretary
stay in Washington for a lot years

302
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,740
he grew up in Bainbridge Island nada
party-line

303
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,450
doubt the harbor the only phone line
this is i think in the forties

304
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,740
and everybody was listening always
listen to the party line

305
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,210
I telephone from Bainbridge Island there
was no expectation of privacy

306
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,690
it was a different different I'm

307
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,920
through the 19th century I

308
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,480
urban populations grew along with
anonymity and

309
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,620
you ended up with I arising

310
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,020
a expectation of privacy something try
to capture

311
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,940
II in this order notional diagram where

312
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,200
you had this order rockwell ara where
urban density furlough

313
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,250
personal and intimate with lower than
you had this with the industrial

314
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,450
revolution through the 19th century

315
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,660
you had the sort of March higher and I
in

316
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,960
urban density in anonymity I public good
fences are and then

317
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,000
around thirty years ago you had this
order when I'm gone the privacy vertigo

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,809
our

319
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:54,770
which is where you had on line density
sorta drop really fast and personal and

320
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,850
Amy drop really fast

321
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,969
and these big data supplied things are
just pull the rug out

322
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,059
and the four out from underneath and
everyone is getting their 15 minutes of

323
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:06,800
fame

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,480
and others are just getting completely
freaked out by this level of exposure

325
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,690
I there are incredible

326
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,860
advances around personalized I

327
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,580
medicines and communications and energy
great things coming out of this

328
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,330
I white one thing that I I thought is
really interesting how

329
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,350
I'm in space is shrinking here I

330
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,699
I grew up in Miami Florida I have been

331
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,190
back I'm live there hi 30 five years

332
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,830
I get a facebook friend request from a
buddy from high

333
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,929
Adam and I'm this is a few years ago

334
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:49,880
and so across 35 years and three
thousand miles I get this friend request

335
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,690
and use a good body I kinda roughneck

336
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,870
I certain parts mind here are less
savory

337
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,000
than others and I really I my kids on
their

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,280
on the side my family all the pictures
like

339
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,950
really accept this friend request from
this guy

340
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,190
so what what what you think I did a
background check

341
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,940
I as I could I and he had prior

342
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,660
actually but nothing violent I think

343
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,010
hi so I have II said

344
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,450
okay I'll get a rough time in the
nineties he got married had a kid

345
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,170
is act-up a little drug trafficking okay

346
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,740
is the nineties I so I accept his
friendship

347
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,120
and it's been fun and and you know

348
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,428
no ill II no cautionary tales to tell

349
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,260
up but I think this level love

350
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,520
information it's all public record
public information

351
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,850
and let me make an empathetic decision
about

352
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,209
someone's life and whether to include
them in my

353
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,630
up and I think that's it it's a new
world

354
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,840
there there is no there's no physical
proximity there I

355
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,928
return temporal proximity I so it's it's
fascinating and

356
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,840
I and when you look at privacy from the
contact the culture and history really

357
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,790
interesting and

358
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,080
want it things I i it's interesting to
look at is sorted this

359
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,320
EU verses US privacy model

360
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,899
it's deeply cultural the United States
we value

361
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,410
disclosure above discretion I values

362
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,820
%uh speech and Prasanna sample really
value

363
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,419
disclosure where your opinion really
value

364
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,390
discretion more than disclosure they
value privacy and due process and equal

365
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,440
protection

366
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,710
not that we'd I'll it's an issue balance

367
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,290
I you know the EU views asses as as
somewhat

368
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,629
reckless and we you them a somewhat
conservative and stodgy its

369
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,290
my view that George Carlin quotes never
know is there one driving faster than

370
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,428
you is a maniac anyone driving slower
than you is an idiot

371
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,500
up I think that's what the in the Wii
the EViews ice

372
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,840
as maniacs and we view them as idiots
and

373
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,209
and I don't think anybody's right here I
think it is where you sit

374
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,290
where you stand everyone is not like you
are doesn't think like you

375
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,870
is wrong in some sense and I think
that's true at all I think it's as we're

376
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,739
just grappling with these

377
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,040
these values that our intention and they
come from

378
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,070
an interesting background up

379
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,629
the EU has in viable right dignity

380
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
this write a personality I

381
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,390
that based dates back in the nineteen
1902

382
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,940
really solidified I after world war two

383
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,700
and the Nazi abuses up the right a
personality

384
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,480
a really I came to embrace privacy
rights

385
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,140
in the US in 1890 Bryant a Brandeis
Warren

386
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,130
I'd created their in from this I right
to be let alone doctrine

387
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,110
I and so that really is all-encompassing
privacy

388
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,469
doctrine whereas in the US we're really
about harm

389
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,150
I especially with respect to I
individuals and corporations everything

390
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,980
except

391
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,360
government and citizen which obviously
have Fourth Amendment privacy

392
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,250
protections

393
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,130
between people and and and corporations

394
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,350
it's really about harmon in 1960 up

395
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,780
a a Prosser put out these these the
sports

396
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,889
and this forum I it's pretty
straightforward

397
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,120
there's the peep in court don't look at
a private information are private

398
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,250
I don't filing with private space don't
assume

399
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,160
anybody's identity don't blab

400
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,860
don't blab private back I and don't
flatter

401
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,760
the United States privacy regime is
pretty much built on those for torts

402
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,170
and there's a set of sectoral privacy
law that goes with those ports

403
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,580
I things around like there's health care
privacy

404
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,720
and there is financial privacy and
there's employment privacy

405
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,980
there's no overarching privacy

406
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,740
which really makes it difficult United
States to figure out when this Privacy

407
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,610
matter and wanted

408
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,649
when doesn't it especially when you're
designing products

409
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,510
and so I came up with this thing I got
on actors think

410
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,400
I when I was an Intel is my guys always
calm with these great ideas

411
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,679
they thought were great ideas how about
we let people search by picture

412
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,350
you take a picture somebody and then you
can really see their back on track

413
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,000
and I'm like oh god awful I

414
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,340
you know be all over the press and not a
good way

415
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,379
I but what I want to do is figure out
how to tease apart

416
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,420
so that this becomes actionable and

417
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,929
there's sorta 3 axes that that this

418
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,400
the privacy turns on I at least

419
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,720
I for this formulate a formulation its

420
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,370
places players and parapsychology the
places are

421
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,959
is a private place for a public place
think that's an important access

422
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,670
I there's a a story

423
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,160
%uh me leaving America's game a couple
years back in we're going up the ramp in

424
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,200
this girl is like taking pictures

425
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,610
everybody coming up the ramp and I was
with somebody cuz I'm a privacy guy some

426
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,270
people say

427
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,559
Wiley prime and I said really

428
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,889
I'm in a public place I can expect that
picture would be

429
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,500
I there be facial recognition %uh

430
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,820
me and will be uploaded on Facebook
everyone known that the game

431
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,270
well how differences that from 150 years
ago when they might have

432
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,030
the time I decided the game not a whole
lot of different

433
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,559
I so it's important understand when
you're in public and when your private

434
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,299
sometimes it's hard to take part it out
with a look at in a minute

435
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,480
the second accesses players are they I
these powerful players

436
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,650
or is there a big power difference
between the players

437
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,510
like a like a citizen and a government
or is it are they peers

438
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,870
fundamentally what can go wrong I think
that is a big issue

439
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,809
what are the perils the players

440
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,190
I disparity actually Bruce Schneier came
up with that

441
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,980
a few years ago I that privacy is really
about

442
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,130
a power equalizing power I think that
that

443
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,390
was a brilliant insight looking this a
couple examples around this if you look

444
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:15,670
at

445
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,690
the places pay sometimes there in a
public place when you think you're in a

446
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,290
private place through the nineteen

447
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,780
I 2009 study by MIT

448
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,960
gaidar project where they were able to I

449
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,970
discern someone sexual orientation by
just their friends on Facebook

450
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,630
even if their privacy saying a clampdown
and how able friend who's a professor

451
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,320
there

452
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,639
hates no point in having controlled
information is all out there anyway

453
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,780
I and I think he makes appoint I

454
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,080
the RP there are things that people are
going to derive I

455
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,419
from public data that is private

456
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,870
and I think that is it really important
I

457
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,610
issue that we're going to talk about it
a little bit

458
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,799
here's one that I i really I really

459
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,929
behavioral targeting me prolly and we
have

460
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:09,890
decide I

461
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,100
if you look at up social media

462
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,570
services on the web what we're paying
with our money

463
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,030
or paying with their data I I did this
post a couple years ago called

464
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,660
your privacy is worth five bucks a month
and the way I came up with five bucks a

465
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,410
month

466
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,000
Facebook market cap with the user base
is what the investor expectation on

467
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,850
return would be and I kinda backed up by
bottom I'm

468
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,168
it's actually much less than that
because market valuing

469
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:42,320
Facebook's revenue quite a bit higher I
maybe a pokémon

470
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,389
I by the fact is I

471
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,890
you can pay with your dating to pay with
your money and I proposed at that time

472
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,120
I two-and-a-half years ago the Facebook
should have a tracker charge of

473
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,790
you either pay them there but you're you
pay them a pokémon

474
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,918
or they can use your data however they
like

475
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,590
I someone gotta pay for the service is
no free lunch here

476
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,860
and actually based on winner came up
with a similar

477
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,120
propose a few months back I do think
that the end the day we gotta figure

478
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,159
have charged for these products

479
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,600
I sure we love the service by if we're
not careful

480
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,428
we're gonna be on the menu

481
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:26,549
talk about power a little bit I would
add to this low bat I

482
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,290
this is this notion of graph privacy
rights for our disparity

483
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,760
so peer to peer there's not much privacy
they're not not have any privacy rights

484
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,210
incorporation into and a customer and
employee there are certainly

485
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,850
statutory protections second five the
FTC Act says a corporation's

486
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,820
certainly I can be unfair unfairly or
deceive

487
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,189
the Fair Credit Reporting Act says that
there's certain

488
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,620
procedure the company must go through
when they're doing a background check on

489
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,639
a prospective employee I between
government and citizen

490
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,200
I there's constitutional protection

491
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,200
between you and your God 9

492
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,010
up between an example of this was like
Target

493
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,040
remember the target anybody remember the
target now you're pregnant

494
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,340
I this is pretty interesting it's a very
simple machine learning problem

495
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,809
because up women had a %uh baby
registries

496
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,820
so they would say hey I'm pregnant I and
people to register to get the baby stuff

497
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,928
they would see what those customers

498
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:33,110
who were registered I for Babies R

499
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,010
what they bought so they wanted had
buildup in training data

500
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,990
around what pregnant women purchase and
then they extrapolated that to the

501
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,890
restive they're

502
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,750
their their customer base I

503
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,230
the challenges they really think about
power applications about because there

504
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,980
was a

505
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,070
I Teen Mom you start to get coupons in
the mail

506
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,780
saying hey we know you're pregnant
combine unscented lotion

507
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,250
server now betting and I and the Father

508
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,260
this teen call park inside

509
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,280
is not pregnant until the dotted

510
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,260
and that was that there's a huge there's
a power disparity between parents and

511
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,580
children

512
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,149
I and that were really was a respected
by Park

513
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,559
and and that only one

514
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,809
abuse of power consider that if an
employee employer new

515
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,639
headed time that their employees with
pride

516
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,440
might they not give them I certain
assignments

517
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,290
I might be not promote I insurance

518
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,330
I might be delivered hand more expensive
great

519
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,620
so people in powerful positions and
exploit

520
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,719
II my can exploit this information

521
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,049
and is only one up to equation back

522
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,780
by I there is a a correlation between

523
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:05,470
chain idea the difference and in power
between players and the secrets the

524
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,440
and actually uses when I look at teams I
and whether they

525
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,780
how much they trust each other and trust
me your trust their leaders

526
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,299
I very if they have a lot of secrets
there now are trust

527
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:19,530
and you can use this as a signal I get
the sense there's a %uh

528
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,740
secrets running around that the team
that means is not a lot of trust and

529
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,350
and that's not a good thing for prop
productivity team

530
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,689
I wrote this post while back why
employees why

531
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,840
name they lied because as the boss of
all the boss is in the position I love

532
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,820
some power

533
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,559
if they can engender trust with the team
the team is going to do whatever they

534
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,620
can typically live

535
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,199
because lie I levels the playing the
PowerPoint feel

536
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,309
that's what they happen and there's no
there's no you know it's a man that

537
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,870
that's what weaker players need to do
that to level things out

538
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,399
putting this all together this place is
players pareles

539
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,169
cases up if you look on the vertical
more powerful players on the vertical

540
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,350
more private places on the horizontal
and

541
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,480
I on the on the right are are are

542
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,030
on the you're on the right or the most
private up places and on the laughter

543
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,250
the more public place and powerful
players on the top and weaker players on

544
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,090
the bottom

545
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,500
and then you could do things like take

546
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,039
paid cases like soap in the press and
plopped a monograph like this

547
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,549
and the the sphere the side the spheres
how perilous

548
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:33,389
I the outcome could be so I took a few

549
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:37,419
actually I sorta collect fees as a hobby
is only like have higher

550
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,440
fifty or sixty other by would make their

551
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,960
the chart even noisier than it is i
right now so let's walk through this a

552
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,980
couple

553
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,220
up so there was a case where the US
supported

554
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,429
a buncha breadth for because they
tweeted that they're going to destroy

555
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,570
America

556
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,120
and really what the man was just gonna
party really hard and so the TSA saw

557
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,729
that

558
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,919
and the board I and and so

559
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,520
certainly public data but in the a very
powerful player

560
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,320
can really exploit that and the point
deportation

561
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,299
is a major deal I mean incarceration
execution deportation

562
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,870
those are things that only governments
can do up

563
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,580
there was a case %uh actually pain in
Georgia where'd she posted pictures

564
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,350
a a of her vacation for a fuse and
Ireland

565
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:32,049
drinking something I she shared those on
Facebook and somehow the

566
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:35,320
school board got when those pictures and
the

567
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,909
her for drinking I and I

568
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,760
this is anything case because Ashley
Payne said I felt violated like someone

569
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,490
stole the pictures at my house

570
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,070
I and I think she got that far wrong
it's not that

571
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,330
no one stole the pictures share the
pictures and and sharing is this store

572
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,120
gateway drug between private and public
its order the slippery slope is there

573
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,510
something in the office and

574
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,950
out there the abuse happened

575
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,069
by the school board muster contract said
you cannot drink at all

576
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:11,668
while you're under contract whether it's
on our time or yours

577
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:16,259
the school board abuse that information
and I know she had filed suit on

578
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,770
Havasu came out but it's clear that was
a clear abusive information

579
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,060
not inappropriate accessible information

580
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,859
up I like this one too I the FBI

581
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,060
put a GPS transmitter on and fun

582
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,090
car you drug kingpin in maryland

583
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,409
I hadam that right he was a drug

584
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,530
and he was convicted and by

585
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,230
the FBI put the GPS transmitter on his
car without a search warrant

586
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,159
tell them from and obviously all that
information

587
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,480
clearly showed he was guilty the supreme
want this case when the Supreme Court

588
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,640
this this supreme court voted nine to
nothing

589
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,790
in Aug 09 nothing anything that

590
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,950
that this was inappropriate search
violation

591
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:10,089
%uh and punt on 4th amendment vacated
vacated the conviction

592
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,460
I clearly a very proud the

593
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,180
clearly a private place but before this
is

594
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,000
this case not so clearly because the
your house is clearly private but is

595
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,140
your car private

596
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,000
and the judges rule that your car
actually is a private place

597
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,060
which I think was a a victory for
privacy advocates

598
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,670
I did something on the up the pier side

599
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,849
love the spectrum I if you member Tyler
Clementi

600
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,960
I a web cam

601
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,260
captured I'm having sacked II and

602
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,490
and suicide public same

603
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,330
and so I its isn't just

604
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,020
large our disparities that and in Para
without sometimes

605
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,869
violation of privacy even by peers and
in parallel outcomes

606
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:02,970
so its important got understand

607
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,368
I this this order framework and figure
out

608
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:11,770
if you're designing products certainly
where

609
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,190
I'll where does your product I lawn on

610
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,490
and if you're doing it now what's
important who are the players

611
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,799
yeah what is the space for your
gathering the data and what potentially

612
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,210
could go

613
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,119
wrong so now I i switch to a way

614
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,660
I from policy for a second and talk
about technology a little bit

615
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,970
I there's a lot to date out there

616
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,049
this is a %uh study I

617
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,220
fourth track cockeyed

618
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,509
earlier this year I actually did last
fall

619
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,690
and I wanted to

620
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,760
or understand what if we want to take
the capacity of the human brain

621
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,020
rented at Amazon what would that cost

622
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,030
and so Chris westbury universe Alberta

623
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,590
a prop third gas and that

624
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:07,599
human brain has 20,000 teraflops compute
capacity and

625
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,190
2.5 had a bite storage in in

626
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,810
estimate I O network but if you're just
the by that Amazon will cost you twenty

627
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,230
seven million dollars a month

628
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:22,950
today however the good news is in 20
years at a cost you less and

629
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,779
seven thousand dollars a year about
fifty three thousand dollars

630
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,680
which in the reason I kinda did this
analysis

631
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,098
was we're doing all these inferences

632
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,930
outside over on brain I were decide
we're making inferences

633
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,210
outside have being

634
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,359
in the same room as someone I for
example some comes in an interview for a

635
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,040
job

636
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,970
you know you can guess their age guess
it and there you can guess the race

637
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,450
I see your making your you're thinking
all this stuff

638
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,000
and use it that's okay course you know
you know what if they're showing you

639
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,420
know they're pregnant

640
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,410
I if you act on those sorts of things
you have a problem

641
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,420
and so now the next question is well if
a big data engine somewhere is making

642
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,869
some inferences

643
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:14,390
should that be allowed even if those
inferences are like way creepy

644
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,098
and very objectionable should that big
data engine still be able to

645
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:23,900
the ride those inferences so this was
motivated by

646
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,140
reminding a conga line the I

647
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,868
he's the Hadapsar Chatwing and and we
were doing I was on a panel with some

648
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:32,330
privacy advocates and

649
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,670
we're talking about the riving up public

650
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,800
I or private back from public data and
Daniel

651
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,220
raise Haney said you now if you can
derive private fat from public that it

652
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,040
sounds like you guys are trying to
decide

653
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,859
fine and you category of thought crime
not just seems wrong

654
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,560
and I was really good question the prime
I we'll look at ourselves

655
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,130
like yeah that's right question I gotta
go think about

656
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,570
and so I did a and so I started I went
back to the source

657
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,109
thought prime George Orwell and said the
promise thought crime

658
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:07,330
and the reason if feels up bad it's
because

659
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:12,200
all everything else leave from thought
and point six hundred years ago louts

660
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,589
who said the same thing

661
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,730
that's become words words become action
back to become habits habits become

662
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,800
character

663
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,760
your character becomes your destiny
everything starts with aw if you could

664
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,230
stop

665
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,520
why you can stop all these have things
might stop

666
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,960
good things up

667
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,230
so if you look at the thought

668
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,170
and speech and access we know that
actions of in our criminal

669
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,530
sometimes speeches actual criminal I in
the case

670
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,010
libel or slander like we talked about
with process sports

671
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,260
conflict with a legitimate interest I
think it snowed in

672
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,900
is having trouble with publishing I
think he's in a published

673
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,020
I but got down we are not crime

674
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,330
except in the case really weird cabron
case conspiracy

675
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,180
theory or conspiracy a crime and using
that comes outta

676
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,950
societies sorry existential response to
it rat

677
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,470
that is for to be on NEC conspiracy
crimes around

678
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,910
organized crime and terrorism typically

679
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,330
but I anything out are every other time

680
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:23,529
conspiracy is not a crime so this is for
the ideology around a stock prime

681
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,940
up a real crime or not and big data
engines do inferences

682
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,400
that the conclusion is yes of course big
day

683
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,400
can do can perform I

684
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,780
so I so that was the theory of it so
then I decided to

685
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,790
really test this theory and if I design
a felon classifier

686
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,660
because we had all this great criminal
dated lesi said

687
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,460
well let's how to put on this little bit
and say well okay thought isn't a crime

688
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,080
what if I try to predict third or figure
out if someone's a felon or not based on

689
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,880
from there so is actually a piece in
today's Bloomberg

690
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,050
news on this town class are there is the
link I the talks to this

691
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,880
in in some detail by I'll go through it
a little bit with you

692
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,930
I I can tell you is we have criminal
data for everybody

693
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,509
United States 150 million defended I

694
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,400
which if you think about that number for
many you know that's gotta be wrong

695
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,970
not $250 million people with a criminal
record United States

696
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,890
there's a lot of duplication that they
usually

697
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,220
that they describe down to about forty
million dependence

698
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,419
in the United States and then what we
did

699
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,550
during this exercises week Wednesday we
weaklings the data we link today and we

700
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,680
sampled state

701
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,460
Kentucky not to become Kentucky by it
was this there was this

702
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,599
it was a small enough data so that we
can release it

703
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,849
this state is up now get a I under I
know my known as the Big Data engine

704
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:47,230
that

705
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,270
that hours and Talia so you gotta get
having I got

706
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:54,470
well down the data up and we to find
some features

707
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,209
and train the learner and and so here's
how the

708
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:01,440
the learner work is an alternating
decision tree

709
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,750
I here's a few of the features gender I
colored how many tattoos

710
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,300
up whether I'm a criminal offenses they
had with

711
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,750
I they weren't so as you walk down the
stairs to records here

712
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,660
one male one female and this is all
trained on this Kentucky data

713
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,580
and so I if you're female with hazel
eyes

714
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,950
and I to more or more tattoos and have

715
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,118
for your misdemeanors you start adding
up these

716
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,180
score three feature and you end up with
4.4

717
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,690
and its above a threshold 3.5 with with
makes a binary decision

718
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,619
whether you're found or not the top
record I

719
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:42,700
doesn't have a high enough ordered to be
classified as a now I'm

720
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,689
so so you can actually check this out I
have

721
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,290
widget actually I might on my blog where
you can actually go

722
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,190
up putting you can actually answer the
questions at all decide whether you look

723
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,240
like

724
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,348
early like a pallet you would think

725
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:01,480
so up so

726
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,990
at some point the technology ends and
the policy begins

727
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,700
and this is why I wanted to how to take
that departed for technology then come

728
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,299
back to

729
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,950
the policy so this is a a a false
negative

730
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,210
fall versus false-positive her that I

731
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,570
defines the performance at the the
classifier

732
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:24,400
and so that line is that the performance
of the classifier based on what wrestle

733
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,810
you want to choose and the best
classifier

734
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,400
would be that line would go through the
origin is that where you would have no

735
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,080
false positives

736
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,270
you have no false negatives are
evidently and

737
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,050
obviously our classifier stock much were

738
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,080
in the ideal classifier but if you look
at the extreme fear

739
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,109
they tell you lock because you have to
pick a threshold

740
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:51,650
in the previous why we picked the
pressure 3.5

741
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,890
up in this country your you're innocent
until proven guilty so you want

742
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,980
the class started not be that aggressive
because if you're a very aggressive

743
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,570
aggressive at all you start to bring in
a classified people as

744
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,599
sounds that are not found for example if
you look at the far right there

745
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:11,770
the the false positive rate is nineteen
percent

746
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,920
yeah I don't miss any Fallon's your
false negative rate is zero

747
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,930
by nineteen percent the PV classifies
are not now

748
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,618
not cool although if you're hiring its
cool

749
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,260
so the resort is anarchy Terry trade-off

750
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,099
you doing a policy determination on
where the threshold

751
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:36,470
be if you if you wanna going for the
anarchy side

752
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:40,399
I I think the most lenient I

753
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,060
spot on this her is ninety-one percent
false negatives

754
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,480
the only catch nine-percent the actual
Fallon's

755
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,060
but you don't miss identify anybody so
it's Thunder Down right no one is about

756
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,020
I and and so policymakers have to choose
where you want to be

757
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,280
on this car because this is

758
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,420
effectively and other technologies like
it

759
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,760
our computerized informants or
computerized

760
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,930
tipster and if you don't couple good
policy with

761
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,230
is kinda technology now problem

762
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:19,440
for placing a problem is in court I
because reason suspicion or probable

763
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,330
cause

764
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,680
is usually our mechanism for vetting out
that police work

765
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,348
I however States courts have upheld

766
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:33,980
profile it was the case with USB Sokolow
where this guy comes in from

767
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,420
a wide Tampa two days

768
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,180
today ticket paid ass used an assumed
name

769
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,879
I they profiled him %ah this guy looks
like drug trafficker and sure enough he

770
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,760
was then

771
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,910
the ruling was upheld but

772
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:54,730
this predictive information had live all
alone by itself

773
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,369
ask actually be corroborated with other
information

774
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:01,609
I as the particularized be efficient to
get

775
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:05,759
I think most importantly needs to be
detailed enough that it doesn't identify

776
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,869
I everybody identifies

777
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:13,080
just the target and I think that's
important based on

778
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,509
and there's more you can look at more
references there

779
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,869
I just on Monday I V I saw the news

780
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:24,210
i New York City's stop and frisk ruled
unconstitutional

781
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,359
they've been doing it for about 10 years
I

782
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,690
six hundred percent increase I

783
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,940
and stop and frisk over the last decade
doesn't 2011 684 thousand people

784
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,839
we're stopping rest I

785
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,369
so I in this is a a quote from the judge

786
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:47,790
I and she said the city police the
blackness back to be stopped the same

787
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,940
rate as a proportion

788
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,550
the local criminal suspect population

789
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,320
that sound like a baseball problem to me
I

790
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,960
and I said okay well let me put on this
a little bit and see

791
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,170
and I don't know for those their
unfamiliar with

792
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,530
basically says that I can you adjust

793
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:12,630
a a probability based on a a general
statistics to something that

794
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,780
uses prize some even additional
information

795
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,130
so in this case we want in our the cop
wants to know

796
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,580
given that someone's a minority what's
the chance that that we should arrest

797
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,250
that's the art that's the money on on on
the left

798
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,500
and the arrest raid is the PSA on the
right

799
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,130
and that the the

800
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,890
ratio I in the middle there is

801
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,368
given that someone is arrested

802
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,660
where they might are they a minority and
what's the minority population

803
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,089
and so the plug in some numbers very
rough numbers and I don't think furtive

804
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:50,970
movements

805
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,828
with for it movements are I I'm assuming
that just based on

806
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:58,160
race alone what what's going on here

807
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,450
so if you say that New York City assumes
that

808
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,328
87 percent I love people that arrested

809
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:09,329
are minorities and 50 percent as a
minority population in New York City

810
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:09,599
with

811
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,640
boxes pack I and the the general

812
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,118
arrest rate is five percent

813
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,190
so given that you're minority should you
be arrested

814
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,810
is about 10 percent which is twice the
amount

815
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,920
I love the general population and so if
you're on the from the city

816
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,030
or conservative blogger within a few I'm
saying

817
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,829
it is a hundred percent greater chance
that a minority stop is justified

818
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,220
overran

819
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,339
like 100 percent but then if you look at

820
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:45,540
this probability what's the problem
someone's

821
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,079
a minority and should not be arrested

822
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,329
that number is ninety percent and the
general population

823
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:56,599
it's 95 percent so my question then is

824
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:59,270
if it's not okay to stop and frisk
ninety-five percent of the general

825
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,970
population

826
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,680
for nothing then why is it okay to stop
and frisk

827
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,339
ninety percent minority population for
nothing

828
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:10,849
it's almost as if like it at the airport

829
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:15,630
you walk through and certain people get
to go through without getting to act and

830
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,180
other people get to go after

831
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,669
get checked that's a problem

832
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,980
so going to the national stage this is
back to our

833
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,480
are places players Parel framework and
and

834
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,619
if you notice before I nor the NSA I

835
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:37,150
citizen surveillance up

836
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,530
this is an important one because we are
really grappling as the country

837
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,650
where the trade-off between security and
privacy

838
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,910
and security and there's a lot of 30
people here right now

839
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,750
I security is probably at least 10 years
ahead a prime

840
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,140
I I think generally security

841
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,220
easy to formally it's really hard to
execute well

842
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,810
but privacy is this it's hard to even
formula

843
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:06,540
and so typically security loses out

844
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,190
our Privacy loses out to security it's
sort of like in the

845
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,230
you know the old adage where with
effective breakfast the pics are

846
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,530
committed but the chickens are involved

847
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,430
security is about commitment and privacy
is really about involved

848
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,220
and that's why privacy typical loses out
to security

849
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,399
however I think that's that's
potentially long-term disaster

850
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,920
and is a a quote by Alex Howard

851
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,420
a a talked about their quite a bit and

852
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,660
I think cafe pretty well ones that were
being affect ross

853
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,299
without being able to verify and I think
that's it a big issue

854
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:48,390
around as a democracy how do we find the
right balance between security and

855
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,348
privacy

856
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:53,230
and soap President Obama is actually
calling for more transparency

857
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,890
in five record them for balance laws to
be reviewed

858
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,839
I which i think is great I think we need
more of that as in SF to be the day that

859
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:04,119
the fis the core rules but soon after we
should be in the know

860
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:08,280
what actually was decided and and why

861
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,510
this was really though kinda disturbing
the NSA chief announced plans to replace

862
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,560
a thousand system administrators with
machines I

863
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,480
you know as snowden and what's known is
a with a system administrator

864
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,950
I and so I guess since the leak is
stopped

865
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,069
the obviously need your is get rid of
everybody who

866
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:30,869
as active that and replace them with
machines

867
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:35,540
I think that's a problem and and I think
that if you look at sort of his pyramid

868
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,359
update a least information information
now now

869
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,000
least the wisdom we usually don't get to
the wisdom part

870
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,890
we're very good at being in amber with
our tools in our toys

871
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,460
I we usually don't think about how they
and

872
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,520
I impact our society substantially
profound way

873
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,710
as they got these things like government
doesn't trust people they trust me

874
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:00,980
you know much transparency know what
they're doing and wisdom is come hard to

875
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,700
come by

876
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,598
and then you have the sentient Brian the
cloud in less than 20 years possibly

877
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,270
I I would be alarmist but break

878
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,300
you know i mean are what are we walking
ourselves into

879
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,430
I that might be hard to walk ourselves
out a up

880
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,868
Henry Mason as is you're amazing II
chief scientist at Bentley I think

881
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:25,680
meredith is great at it I think I I
really like witches

882
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,259
map with code is awesome and yes it is
really awesome

883
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,790
but it's not always awesome I sometimes
it's not so awesome

884
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,550
I think we'll realize in 2008 that map
as was not so awesome

885
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,520
I where we had financial weapons of mass
destruction that almost brought down the

886
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,220
World

887
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,430
world economy I so

888
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:49,190
like any good equation be improved by a
well

889
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,900
place television I why we

890
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,030
try to look at what are the values that

891
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,740
we in dow with our great technology in
pools

892
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,410
I to make map with code awesome the
values are

893
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,859
negative their its powerfully negatively
awesome

894
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:11,598
but if they're good values then maybe
they can really help things the problem

895
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,260
is that values are not very exact

896
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:19,220
I they are often in conflict like
security and privacy

897
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,759
and security and liberty and and
restraint and openness and things like

898
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,820
that so

899
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,950
we have to figure out how to get there
from here

900
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,169
I one last story

901
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,690
I when I got out of school

902
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,950
and now I I'm ready 5144 lock

903
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:41,240
what now Lockheed Martin at the time
with dynamic spaces systems in San Diego

904
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,669
and I was gonna work on the space
shuttle and we're gonna put our

905
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,070
upper stage in the shuttle so I saw for
work

906
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,650
January 27 1986 the next day

907
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,420
the next day the shuttle blows up

908
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,190
and so we were like we on this
government contract to work on our heels

909
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,230
for about six months while they did

910
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,720
the the investigation why this happened

911
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,899
and it turned out as we all know that
the Rogers commission was

912
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,000
form and richard fineman I you

913
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,050
I i think I love you should now I

914
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:19,810
Nobel laureate in physics actually came
out with the reason why

915
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,990
this happen and it turns out it's very
cold for the morning and the O-rings

916
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,629
lost their last the city and

917
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,770
and gas II ghastly I

918
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,119
ghastly and and and punctured

919
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:35,500
the me and so

920
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,880
funny thing is fine really was able to
be on the Rogers Commission

921
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,970
right his wife actually convince them to
be on the commission she said you know

922
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,230
this and eleven guys

923
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,420
and and women I think I was on active up

924
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,010
me eleven people in this not running
around from meeting to meeting

925
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,570
presentation presentation

926
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:55,500
me one mosquito buzzing around looking
for the answer now is

927
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,690
Richard and she cannot be right because
William Rogers secretary say during the

928
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,140
commission at one point was

929
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:06,509
quarters you know saying its fine guys
really got me crazy

930
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:10,010
and and and yet he found the answer and
he wasn't

931
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:14,099
in aviation expert he was in the space
industry is why I

932
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,609
I like to think I've as an eclectic
general

933
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:22,140
and aquatic generalist are these
technologies that actually can endow the

934
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,660
technology with the value the culture

935
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,299
and Steve Jobs is famous for this
obviously I love is quote I

936
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,470
1996 he says I

937
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,649
nonprofit Microsoft is there just have
no taste

938
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:39,380
and not in a small have no case in a big
way

939
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,890
I in that they don't think originally
and they don't in dow

940
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:46,490
their their products with the diver the
culture

941
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:49,819
and I think that's really important if
you look at I

942
00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:55,980
Norio guy up who is president of Sony in
the seventies

943
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,609
he oversaw the development %uh compact
disc player

944
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:04,819
and he required that it had 74 minutes

945
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:10,380
a body y7 for me

946
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,930
there you know 53 beethoven's ninth

947
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:18,290
74 minutes and he didn't want to change
the CD

948
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,740
and so he drove the teams to get seventy
four minutes

949
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,098
%uh audio on that CD and

950
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:29,400
I just love that story because it really
shows that this cultural value

951
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,560
music and art was in doubt into

952
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,759
I something that was critical for the
aging something rely upon our

953
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,930
built on I into what what we take for
granted now in

954
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,759
music on demand and you see that I

955
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,640
important dynamic over and over and over
again

956
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,328
because quite honestly I would argue we
are making this stuff up as we go

957
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:57,310
anyone who tells you differently to the
following you were following themselves

958
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,900
and I think they're sorta four stages
that that we go through

959
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,400
I friend in my eye sign through this of
an element

960
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,069
by your bike out beer they will do
anything I

961
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:11,400
and so he and and I think there's
evolution of technology you go from

962
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,890
in a sense which is sorta deny like
there's no problem and then you get this

963
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,290
frontier stage

964
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,819
in privacy certainly we r we're in this
for a while with this yr

965
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:24,970
just get over it privacy dad promulgated
by a lotta technology leaders

966
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:29,740
I meant we often have the sort of I over
rotation for regulation like there's all

967
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,459
these ongoing

968
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,119
every delays in and I think regulations
a very blunt instrument and its

969
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,210
sometimes it's like scratching your back
with a chainsaw

970
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:41,990
yes you get yes but there's a lot well
collateral damage

971
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:45,439
and then you get to this innovation
stage right thank you have

972
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,790
smart regulation or smart policy
connected

973
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,150
to innovation and so the question is
really

974
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,420
how you get there from here and our
targets not

975
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,730
how but it's more who is important

976
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:03,329
and I talked about geeks suits and long

977
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:07,680
for a while now and I think those are
the pillars responsible innovation

978
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,339
I I think if you have only two of the
three

979
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,828
you don't really have what's necessary
and sufficient to

980
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:18,880
I get to the right answer I

981
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,740
I think if if you look at because raw
making this up as we go

982
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,149
there's a sort of Overton Window let you
must you must have tension on either

983
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,069
side

984
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:31,849
I in order to find the right answer so
you have to have this push poll

985
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:35,109
tug-of-war to find the right answer cuz
honestly we're just kicking around in

986
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:35,560
the dark

987
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,089
really don't understand where we're
going and we need this dynamic

988
00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:44,029
a a debate and experimentation to get
there

989
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,660
because I think the cycles really
important I think we invent things and

990
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,390
then we

991
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:51,629
question them in scrutinizing criticize
them I

992
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:56,030
this crew clearly does that and embraces
that I think that's really important

993
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,579
and then you need to do it again life
lesson learned do it again

994
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,700
I wanna the objective I'll

995
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:07,049
not it's the new companies really
understand data flows in like

996
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:11,020
companies understand the data they have
been I compete with that efficiently and

997
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,410
easily and I'm really excited about that
because I think there's a lot

998
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:18,790
knowledge and wisdom out there that's
that needs to be understood

999
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,069
so that's all I have I really appreciate
the attention

1000
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:25,470
I i think we have I'm question to

1001
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:32,470
with the bay thanks

1002
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:41,910
I wanted to make a comment about slide

1003
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:46,190
you know how much people your privacy

1004
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:49,520
back in Iraq where you known

1005
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,200
very small number of people and you
could move somewhere else and no one

1006
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,828
would know anything about you

1007
00:59:55,829 --> 01:00:00,079
there's a difference between someone
seen your license plate

1008
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,520
in public and having databases

1009
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,940
have your license plate with GPS
coordinates an times

1010
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,950
info in so there's there's a

1011
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:16,480
it's not quite just which public lot
more

1012
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,520
i would i would agree I but I the world
is

1013
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,280
my point is the world is shrinking and
these datasets are shrinking it

1014
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,730
and there is we are going my point is
not that

1015
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:30,319
it's all its I'm not saying get over it
i'm saying that

1016
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:34,450
these technology are shrinking the world
and we need to use the values that we

1017
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,310
had then

1018
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,109
love respect and empathy in order to
live in a world where you just can't

1019
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:41,910
hide behind anonymity

1020
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,368
and so yes there are certain abuses
around access to data that we

1021
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:50,050
we should curtail I certainly health
data and other

1022
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:53,400
other kinds of data need to be protected
but when those

1023
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,920
when that they'd invariably gets out how
we gonna be

1024
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,160
with it are we gonna II behave
responsibly and respectfully

1025
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,279
and not abuse that that information I
think

1026
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:10,000
work we're headed down that that road in
this can turn off all the data

1027
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,040
you have to act responsibly back

1028
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,060
problem ike for a regular person

1029
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,250
how would you even know who's collecting
information on you

1030
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,260
let alone can you go there opt out
correct

1031
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:26,869
sector how do you even know I think I
think it's coming one reason we put out

1032
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:28,970
that through our products the least you
could now

1033
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,109
at least you can see what's out there
nears there's actually

1034
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:35,420
legislation in Congress now to give you
access to the information

1035
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,970
about that's publicly available and even
private L

1036
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:42,419
and I'm I'm a big supporter that because
I think without transparency

1037
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,720
we don't know what's going on so I think
once we know then we could take

1038
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,189
appropriate steps

1039
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,460
are you control it how you corrected you
comment on it

1040
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,630
make sure the record's clear

1041
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,839
sir I I'm moving this with as a ride

1042
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:59,869
really like this talking thing was great
lots of questions but I'll try to stick

1043
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:00,150
to

1044
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:04,349
to just two so one is comment about the
power disparity

1045
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:08,040
sort of hinted at in beginning when you
talk about

1046
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:12,390
stalkers and victims can I think I think
isn't and recognize that power disparity

1047
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,700
because as an

1048
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,180
law-abiding individual you're kinda
powerless just any crazy person out

1049
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,828
there

1050
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:21,490
and actually because my work in security
I had a mentally unstable stopper for a

1051
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:22,529
while and was

1052
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,680
by talking to realize how easy they can
find out where well it

1053
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,930
so that's one thing I think you should
add to that a question

1054
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:33,680
the other thing is whether consumers
really have a choice today

1055
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,819
is there a 20-year-old who can choose
not to be on Facebook

1056
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:40,410
not have a cell phone be off the grid
and still have a social life

1057
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,799
that really a choice I agree I don't
think it's a choice and that's why I

1058
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,859
think we are in this round

1059
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:48,859
new policies to deal with that
inescapable reality the

1060
01:02:48,859 --> 01:02:52,869
just can't get off the grid in so how do
you

1061
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:56,569
to the ladies previous question is how
do you know when information is out

1062
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:57,509
there

1063
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:01,300
how you make sure the people act
responsibly with

1064
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,220
that's the error that we ran and its
gonna i think is gonna be this

1065
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,259
reemergence love a of manners

1066
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,020
and and empathy and better behavior in
order to

1067
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:15,460
deal with right the previous lady's
question now that

1068
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,230
your village is actually the world
that's right

1069
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,339
thank you I'm keep

1070
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:27,750
Park so I just one question for you

1071
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:33,000
you belief that uses have right to view
the profiles that you have created for

1072
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,930
them

1073
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:36,960
and should they be able to change

1074
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,309
what the thing might be wrong about them

1075
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:45,109
yeah absolutely i II that's one reason
why talk about their product

1076
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:49,230
if you that transparency I so there's
always

1077
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,250
to questions and and you you now both

1078
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,730
which is what information's out there
and then can I correct

1079
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,920
and the challenge with correction that
we have today which i think is a

1080
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,790
same is that a company like & telly it
sits at the very end to the data

1081
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,509
supplied thing

1082
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,650
their retail and there's this tremendous

1083
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,180
data sucking machine that is they supply
chain

1084
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,359
upstream that retail and so

1085
01:04:14,359 --> 01:04:17,930
what you really want to do if you really
want to correct it at the headwaters

1086
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:21,089
that supply chain at all possible I

1087
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:25,040
and that's not possible today
unfortunately I think it's changing

1088
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,630
and I think more more public pressure
around

1089
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,930
that will will take a obvious ultimately

1090
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,940
if you look at the Fair Credit Reporting
Act which i think is important to the

1091
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,369
fair card bring act was

1092
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,589
established in 1970 and

1093
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:44,040
it basically says that someone's going
to use information for your lively

1094
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,240
where you live when you get a job and I

1095
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,700
no matter where they get the data they
have to share with you whether there's

1096
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,270
any

1097
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,940
adverse information and what that says
is

1098
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,530
and resided at it because if your name
is John Smith the chance that you're a

1099
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,050
victim of mistaken identity

1100
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:03,780
issue and there's a lot of John Smith's
out there that are criminals and their

1101
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,599
son Ubuntu Johnson is that are
law-abiding citizens

1102
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:10,690
and if someone pulls wrong back on 2nd
decides not to hire you because it

1103
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:15,200
that's not fair you're not that johnson
et and so

1104
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,720
access information I to the

1105
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,200
previous element point is the world is
shrinking and

1106
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,410
date is available we can't abuse it and

1107
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:29,450
FCRA says release important

1108
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:32,750
survival I'm Contax housing why men

1109
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,990
concern you have to abide by these rules

1110
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:39,290
how do we get there with these

1111
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:42,910
less vital uses the day that's the
question I think that

1112
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:47,578
we as a society figure out

1113
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:51,710
sorry tyson he said now works for
Facebook so I definitely enjoyed the

1114
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:52,910
stock

1115
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:56,009
I had to kind related questions first
would be

1116
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:00,380
do you see as we move forward as
technology gets better and we

1117
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,819
have more and more information that is

1118
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:07,710
being gathered created about people even
indirectly

1119
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:11,470
tells the story morning agreeing on
innovation tax where

1120
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:16,040
you things can be inferred about you
will the value transparency

1121
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,569
go down as the information about you out
there

1122
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:23,759
just grows and grows with time yeah I

1123
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,450
really good question that's why I
ultimately have great faith

1124
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,490
and regulation are

1125
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:34,569
or at least policy around abusive the
data itself because

1126
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:38,430
at the end of the day doesn't matter
where I got the day weather was inferred

1127
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:40,220
or not or private or public

1128
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:43,578
am I gonna use that data against
somebody

1129
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:46,869
I and for an abusive use wetherbee

1130
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:51,309
completely criminal like stocking and
and other kinds offenses that are

1131
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:55,950
harassment those are the things or my to
use it in a very subtle way

1132
01:06:55,950 --> 01:07:00,680
I to discriminate I know that

1133
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,700
insurance companies know who are back
there now they know who are bad risks

1134
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,220
are they using that to like based on
social the

1135
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:12,808
media a no is a bad wrist

1136
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:15,890
I don't think they're at the point using
that data to

1137
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:19,348
allow or disallow policies when you call
to cancel

1138
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:22,750
in a fight you less if you're a bad
wrist

1139
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:26,640
and so you start to see the sort of
insidious use of this information

1140
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,598
and are those uses all appropriate or
not I think youth based policy

1141
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:34,609
is where we're going because access
based policy

1142
01:07:34,609 --> 01:07:38,828
is you really can't you don't know where
they came from

1143
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:42,130
so there's its it's gonna be

1144
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:46,220
a growing problem where you space is
very

1145
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:50,020
although difficult at least track

1146
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,849
yeah I I think you can answer yeah
addressing was there which was that

1147
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:57,920
UN Security we've said for a long time
that security through obscurity is

1148
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,170
is not a practical approach I've been
seeing a lot of people in the press

1149
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,869
more recently dealings rights issues
anti-media

1150
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:08,119
privacy through security but again it's
for those things were as the technology

1151
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:08,859
grows

1152
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:12,640
that to seems to become licensed
practical rights yeah i i agree

1153
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,068
I don't think that I don't think that
there

1154
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:19,250
i think is a short term thing with this
Floyd they're they're worth companies

1155
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,738
out there that which is floyd

1156
01:08:20,738 --> 01:08:24,269
the net with stuff about in order to
cover-up

1157
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:28,150
the other stuff I don't think like an
arms race to me

1158
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:31,460
thanks I for

1159
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,310
such from you this authentic neatly so

1160
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:39,850
I like your comparison between europe
and the US so there was something

1161
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,109
probably usually know there's a big
debate in Europe on the right

1162
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:47,160
to be forgotten so I would really like
to hear your opinion on this

1163
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,870
yeah that's it that's a good 1i actually
I hate them like my post but I will post

1164
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:51,330
on that

1165
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:55,100
I harm that talks about the right to be
forgotten

1166
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,969
and the problem that I have with the
right to be forgotten

1167
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:02,429
it is is really at the crux of this
disclosure discretion

1168
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:07,520
I debate if you look at disclosure close
on the heels of disclosure is the right

1169
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,279
to an accurate history

1170
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,440
and if you up if you have a right to be
forgotten

1171
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,160
where is history gonna go from there and
in the exam I like to use is on

1172
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,858
the public Twitter fight so I've been
involved in some Twitter fights

1173
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:25,480
you know are and there's been a lot of
water fights

1174
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:28,968
so the thought experiment I like that
provide

1175
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:34,529
is I'm in for a fight with you we both
say things that we regret

1176
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:37,529
and we both agree that we just like

1177
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:40,900
a racist because we both embarrass
ourselves

1178
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:43,910
knows unfortunate got it would only say

1179
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:48,679
a a racetrack I don't think that's right

1180
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:51,359
and the reason I don't think it's right
it's because other people were watching

1181
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,190
the Twitter fight

1182
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,219
and there's a public value to that and
they're gonna take some lessons from

1183
01:09:57,219 --> 01:09:57,940
that

1184
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:02,989
may be good lessons may be bad but
there's a public record their

1185
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:06,000
up and the fact that he should be able
to

1186
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,179
erase public history i think is really
dangerous

1187
01:10:10,179 --> 01:10:14,710
up I think on the flip side or the
argument I often hear is

1188
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,480
yeah but the internet never forgets
can't there be

1189
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,049
some tailing off I love

1190
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:26,250
up the historical record and every heart
I

1191
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,670
yes I drop you want I think the problem
is not really

1192
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:32,770
tweets but things is more

1193
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,699
it's a serious offense like your
criminal record for essence

1194
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,730
in particular for his been acquitted I
think

1195
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:43,928
a certain point the problem with Google
in Italy one guy was

1196
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:47,840
first inflicted or persecuted for
something he was completely acquitted

1197
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,380
right expired so expungement of records
should be possible

1198
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,679
I agree I agree with that and there are
certain circumstances but I think

1199
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:55,070
they're

1200
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:59,120
the key word there are certain
circumstances that

1201
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,780
warrant that kinda that country we

1202
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,550
Intel is expunged record all the time to
a criminal records and I think that's

1203
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,320
important

1204
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,980
and but I think they are very particular
rise assert certain classes

1205
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,530
that are the most egregious that really
should have a shelf life

1206
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:19,739
up but I think when you say right to be
forgotten

1207
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:23,759
its could be a interpret very broadly
now all the sudden

1208
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,449
you know the internet is for getting
every seven days and obviously

1209
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:34,449
you know that's hyperbole but if it's
hard to find that balance

1210
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,460
Scott Hensley with the science and tech
for DHS

1211
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,630
during the talk it seems very western
centric you talked about

1212
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:46,210
implicitly things here in the US and
Europe it seems to me that

1213
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:49,760
we're headed down a slippery slope where
this is you know social control

1214
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,449
capability

1215
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:54,719
thought about what men are dicks in your
Chinese here you can be doing with your

1216
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,179
technology in say 10 years to

1217
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:01,170
facilitate things and make people like
Joseph Goebbels proud in terms of

1218
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,520
controlling everything that's going on
in our society

1219
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,719
thought about that side equation sure I
mean

1220
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,150
I think that I think I mean is your
point that

1221
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:14,549
if you understand more the information I
that is therefore more easily

1222
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:19,460
you can more easily exploited that
affair

1223
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,750
I was struck by the movie some years ago
the lives of others which is an east

1224
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,239
european documentary that looked at

1225
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:29,230
citizen spying on themselves all across
Eastern Germany which was one of the

1226
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,799
ways that the country was so tightly
controlled

1227
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,070
finally came apart but somebody's
technology some

1228
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:39,380
this stuff when you look at it from the
perspective

1229
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:43,350
state-run societies that are interested
in controlling

1230
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,660
all their society the implications are
not particularly good

1231
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,809
yeah I i'm not I think when para
disparities

1232
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:54,570
large the law must

1233
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,190
curtail those kinds of abuses now yeah
on certain

1234
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,530
per pallet Erin societies there's no law

1235
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:05,670
and so therefore people need to keep
their secrets in order to

1236
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,820
to balance the power disparity I'm not

1237
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,880
I'm ap I absolutely believe that of
course I mean that

1238
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,679
as the only to you hack I I don't
necessarily think that

1239
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,980
the way forward is to up stop

1240
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:22,349
turn of the day to turn up tools I
because

1241
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:26,570
up the abuses I'd I think it's important
to deal head on with the abuses

1242
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:31,580
I think white I mean I'm surprised
that's the at work known question

1243
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:36,239
away for I by I I think yes

1244
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,449
you know every cool can be used for good
or for ill

1245
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:42,669
and I think the law is often white

1246
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:46,500
prepare what we're prepared to society
to get the most out of a technology

1247
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,300
yeah and it could be a view hi I think
that we are running an experiment but I

1248
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,350
don't think the way forward is back

1249
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:58,890
name we disagree agreed

1250
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:03,040
thank you very much excellent talk about
a dozen years ago there was a

1251
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,440
guy promoting big data before it became
very popular but basically

1252
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,620
he said that om the worst thing you can
do

1253
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:15,199
at the time now was in terms of giving
up

1254
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:20,480
who you are was basically go to the same
supermarket at that time ANP supermarket

1255
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,400
was very big

1256
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,460
and basically over a month go in there

1257
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,440
him pay with your credit card because
from their data and they were getting

1258
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,049
about a terabyte of data from the cash
registers

1259
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,890
every day so basically they knew how
many toothpicks you

1260
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:38,980
wat if you bought pampers all kinds
medical

1261
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,299
so basically they had a profile that was
obviously was internal

1262
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,800
to their own data move servers but my
question is

1263
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,739
is that information shared and is that
legal and it was when I go into a credit

1264
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:53,650
card and i buy something

1265
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:57,400
is that legally doable today

1266
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,120
terms of what I bought that's not true
is it legally terrible are

1267
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,420
arts can someone go by that date is that
correct no words if I bought

1268
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:09,370
a hundred dollars with the groceries and
I bought everything from soup to nuts

1269
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,929
my question is is that information
currently

1270
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:16,210
on the market on the market sold ob no
it's not

1271
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:20,449
at least I mean we were races buyers
information and tell you

1272
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:24,379
I we never saw those datasets I think
those datasets that they were made

1273
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,219
available

1274
01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:30,469
I would there be a huge try again that's
what the guy I mentioned the point that

1275
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:33,130
he made from it with Anissa going back a
dozen years

1276
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,679
is that he was saying is that if people
knew how much information

1277
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:40,449
because from it you okay what books did
you buy at the supermarket

1278
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:43,589
you know arwood political leanings you
have any kind of you know

1279
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:47,670
social interest you have or don't have
and that is that they said well if

1280
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:52,219
koko's down by 10 cents you buy pepsi
right miserable this type of thing

1281
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:56,690
which was me scared everybody but that
sorta follows up with

1282
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:02,349
do you think that we're going to go to
legislation and I think with the prior

1283
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,420
questioner asked was that I am the owner

1284
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:09,260
up some pieces of digital data whether
it's my face

1285
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:14,780
my search a log my public record my non
public records that really don't need to

1286
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,040
be public

1287
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,340
arm do you see that really we need to
define that because really at some point

1288
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,000
people could say well my

1289
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,210
DNA sequencing is my property is in it

1290
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,810
yeah I thank you yeah II greats a
question I think that

1291
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:33,810
the question the the number the question
is what is private and what is public

1292
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:37,350
and I think there needs to be in there
is right now

1293
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:40,719
they did that private is generally
private except when we

1294
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,429
give it away and so supermarkets don't
have

1295
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:47,600
re are the the pain

1296
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,219
affair in that information fireplaces is
much much greater than the game

1297
01:16:52,219 --> 01:16:56,420
I online services the quaint little
different

1298
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:00,540
I would argue that your private

1299
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:04,199
where online behavior is pretty pride

1300
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:09,169
and yet we're giving away in exchange
for services all the time

1301
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:12,390
and you know that that worries

1302
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:17,000
because I think that the supermarkets
have and the change have

1303
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,620
a much bigger vested interest in keeping
your private information private

1304
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:25,910
because it is so a revealing band

1305
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:30,230
summer the online service and and the
problem that I have with the online

1306
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,910
service is really the

1307
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:35,420
we you know we as users other because we
like it we love

1308
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,739
of free stuff great but it's not really
free

1309
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:43,839
and there's really no business model yet
that summers at Wal

1310
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,080
allow me to pay for services with money

1311
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,910
instead of data and I think that's a
problem

1312
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,929
II center for last three years Facebook
should at

1313
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:56,929
a charge me option I

1314
01:17:56,929 --> 01:18:01,370
I think it's at odds with with I think
the current business model online with

1315
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,280
other online services

1316
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,949
coming to pick on Facebook at all I but
many online services are free

1317
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:10,969
but they're not free and I think

1318
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:14,960
unfortunately I people like to

1319
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,170
up they don't like the privacy
violations by they hate

1320
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:22,620
paying with their money more and as I
alluded to earlier

1321
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:27,460
if you look at sort of the the present
cost for the future privacy disaster

1322
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:32,090
its 0 for most people equation they do
is like well

1323
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:35,320
twenty years ago block my faith but I
really wanna

1324
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,340
check out this new service online and
I'm gonna do it

1325
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,770
and so their that I think that dynamic
has grab hold the bus

1326
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:46,060
and there hasn't been anything that is
shaking

1327
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:50,070
I think the the latest I

1328
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:54,349
government trespasses have helps
advertisers that

1329
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,730
to that a little bit I and maybe they'll
be more drum beat around

1330
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:01,830
backers may be over rotated for openness
we're gonna guys iraq to back

1331
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:05,910
for defining private spaces and a more
comprehensive way

1332
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:09,050
I do think we're going to get there
privacy is not dead

1333
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,199
this is a new technology I anyway

1334
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:15,919
you've read II Jeff Jarvis writes about
this the right about gutenberg in the

1335
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,670
present burden to figure out

1336
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:21,739
you know half millennia ago then even
know what the printing presses point for

1337
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:23,928
fifty years later after was invented

1338
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:26,960
we are white and year maybe

1339
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,150
20 up the Internet and so we're figuring
this out as we go

1340
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,739
we need to have you know ask tough
questions

1341
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:40,830
a the services that we use in an hour
governor

1342
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:47,670
and the of so if there are no more
questions

1343
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:52,300
at I about snow I after

1344
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,780
after up so

1345
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:59,259
I as I alluded to i you know

1346
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,489
so I think we're all II don't speak for
anyone I'm a little next month

1347
01:20:03,489 --> 01:20:08,330
on the one hand I feel like he clearly
broke the law

1348
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:11,489
I but he clearly

1349
01:20:11,489 --> 01:20:14,730
gave us some information we need and I'm

1350
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:19,379
is a great quote from Martin Luther King

1351
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,520
the cold front the jet just a bit is

1352
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,179
I highest form respect for the law is to
break the law banning face

1353
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:30,239
your accuser and and he did

1354
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,309
the first part but he didn't do the
second part and

1355
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:37,670
he would be much more hero its second
part faces accuser became

1356
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:41,710
I because I but I I do feel like we do
need to have this national debate

1357
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,969
about the security privacy tradeoff for
making

1358
01:20:44,969 --> 01:20:48,370
I and where our society is going to be
long term

1359
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:52,800
because it's important that for
democracy for work we need to know why

1360
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,100
the people that are acting on our behalf
are doing and so he gave us a glimpse

1361
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,920
into what

1362
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,219
they're doing and its I think its

1363
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:04,790
its their hearts are in the right place
to try to protect us

1364
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:07,870
but it's a slippery slope Italian karen
