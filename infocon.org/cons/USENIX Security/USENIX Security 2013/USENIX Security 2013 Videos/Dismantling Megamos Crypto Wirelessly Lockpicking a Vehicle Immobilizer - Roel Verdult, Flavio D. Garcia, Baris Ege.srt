1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,299
welcome to the stock

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,120
happy so many people

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,009
still hereof the conference because
issue of course the Lost Ark I'm

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,820
I want to start with the thanking also
USENIX Association organizes if this

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,230
of dizzy vent for the opportunity for us
to talk

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,509
give 'em just nice or commander

7
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:34,809
exceptional circumstances and

8
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,250
now we are basically not allowed to a to
present the paper

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,550
but yup we are allowed to I'm about to
present

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,250
the subtitle of a paper due also
dismantling this man thing manuscript a

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,769
wireless lockpicking

12
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,820
a few can mobilize it was joint work
between them I i'm their army I'm

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,010
overgrowth Burridge age a

14
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,390
we are from the rubble University 9 a.m.
flooded this year from

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,750
I'm University room so

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,220
hmm our server disclaimer not

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,190
you know do a recent the injunction by
the High Court long the star cannot

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,750
cover

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,780
technical core of our accepted paper I

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,090
reason we will not reviewed any do you
feel sees

21
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,490
in this talk also some

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,619
interaction I am basically

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,510
we will stick to slice I we will not
answer questions

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,530
I'm sorry for to but I hope you
understand

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,200
I am ru however rules

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,210
are happy to see what justice the
discussions in the community

27
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,979
also after newt or chrome may be
difficult to rise instead of

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,810
question answer for me I am I since
legal procedures are still ongoing

29
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,250
yeah wanna mention we can't really going
to the I'll

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,560
so what I am gonna tell them I well let
me give you an overview

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,310
I'll just for some juicy if you can
mobilize is what is it

32
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,500
most you know last year outstanding

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,989
as well on the USENIX conference talking
about Fuego mobilizes

34
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,099
I am but I will just revisit that

35
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,290
the therefore I am I'll show what is it

36
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,750
I'll talk about related work from I will

37
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,510
zoom in on this high-tech to work with
last year

38
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,870
because it's not so different for read
it now

39
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,890
and a the No pay some attention to
responsible disclosure for

40
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,940
I'm I just the reverse engineering
because this

41
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,940
in Folsom in these kinds of security
your

42
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,780
testing did the strength of security
mechanisms and

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,280
well up or not some other litigations
and alternatives that

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,129
that were proposed by the academia but
as well as the industry been of

45
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,030
finally within the conclusion so what
does it mean

46
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,110
if you go immobilizer buser electronic
anti-theft device

47
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,250
as introduce around nineties a and

48
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,019
its was mostly used in Europen smaller
countries but now those uses

49
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,130
also I a fairy a custom to use in the US
cars as well

50
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,660
a profound so hot wiring so you know

51
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,010
from the old movie set you can just to
put some wires together in driveway

52
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,120
well that is what tries to two

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,540
arm to be from an its it's even
mandatory

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,209
in several countries a it's based on a
on a

55
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,700
are pretty track in the low-frequency
review for you see I don't fire

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,578
and am that works in a way that the in
the car

57
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,560
basically has a new near to the ignition

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,720
ASM electric power magnetic field which
powers

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,269
with chip which is a passive ship
without a battery and then

60
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,769
day out some communication exchanges 0

61
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:09,239
show mornin next slide I but before that
though I want to make sure the

62
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,200
should not be confused with the the
remote locking system of a car

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,789
so what you owe me know you sure key

64
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,010
you press a button and the car opens and
then use

65
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,770
step in the car and you put your key in
the ignition turn it around and start

66
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,299
your car

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,570
it is the same device you holding but
actually you too

68
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,320
separate things I we looked at the park

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,500
where you put the you car you turn in
the ignition

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,990
and there is a low frequency for going
on and that's

71
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,370
aceptar chip and in this case a

72
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,680
and and opening the door or do designing
a lime

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,780
is is a completely different Barton

74
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,409
we didn't look good that's I'm

75
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:56,550
so that this is basically a a simple a
of you want what I show now it's a

76
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,110
how demobilize we're going very simple
way you have ignition lock and then turn

77
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,169
it around ignition lock in your car

78
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,430
and you have any other side effect
dickey a

79
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,180
where there is a transponder in this key
it's a very tiny

80
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,180
glossed the in this in this serving

81
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,629
and you see the red arrow pointing to it
at school transponder

82
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,979
transfusion response and well the
sounding name

83
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,030
an what you a what a base he does is

84
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,940
some simple cryptographic operations I'm

85
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,780
but how it starts as the following you
put it in the ignition lock and then the

86
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,429
car

87
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,750
detect there is something so it says
okay please

88
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,440
identify yourself and then the
transponder sends back

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
its I don't for its number not a car

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,150
looks sharp do a notice number

91
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,340
if it is in known by a wide miss than

92
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,340
it sense a around number plus approve

93
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,799
back to do then the car key and a car
key

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,990
validates okay is this car knowing my
secrets

95
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,000
a if so them it also sends back a proof

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,210
two-car and the car Danka

97
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,818
as well validated got proof is is
genuine

98
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,349
then you have a mutual authentication in
this setting although probably

99
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,289
most view already spotted there are two
things here once the jurors a

100
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:29,870
I'm there's a a wide this thing so if
you don't have a a correct identifiers

101
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,370
so you would just walk to your car and
tried to communicate with

102
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,400
then it would just be more you because
you don't know number which is known in

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,900
car

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,940
and secondly there is no randomness from
the

105
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,370
DAC from Bernard a the car can

106
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,529
there's no fresheners there are no wrong
number introduced by the carton

107
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,069
that means there's a replay attack
possible well

108
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,560
buddhism basically on car in mobilizes

109
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,360
on a pretty big problem because on all
the ones

110
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,099
i've seen and Lisa for so

111
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:07,360
how let me naming a tho bit about the
related workable Sun

112
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
over the years I am in 2005 for the

113
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,139
using security symposium bono I told
showed

114
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,819
I'm how you can actually recover key
over

115
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,719
offered dick digital signature
transponder chip

116
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,580
there was a a introduced in 1995 and it
only had a 40-15

117
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,779
so yeah instead you have to do complex
mathematical

118
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,490
tricks or do some cryptographic great
you basically good just search for two

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,070
key because

120
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,849
to 240 is not so challenging I am

121
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:44,979
well nowadays this is replaced by a or

122
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:50,139
DC 80 which is a proprietary algorithm
or or another chip would actually use a

123
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:50,830
ass

124
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,020
I am and on a 10-yard bit a

125
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,280
which are all going out later inner

126
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
mitigation search so

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,190
hmm then we go to ki larki la cosa es is
quite

128
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,500
some more work Don McKellar this
basically because

129
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,120
the key was 64 bit so it's been more
challenging

130
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,230
and the awesome interesting work you
could do on

131
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,700
on this cryptographic algorithm next
year also you could learn from it and

132
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,409
how you could

133
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:25,680
use improve or not make so similar
cryptographic States and the singer's

134
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,910
around the same time

135
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,300
and in the end the a

136
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,070
to recover two key units around
complexity of 244 encryptions

137
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,190
I show less severe than

138
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,430
war-related papers on this on this topic

139
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,520
am do to divest among nor are

140
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,790
of my knowledge actually a is the is
this QR

141
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,040
not longer deployed in there in
automotive industry

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,630
between maybe could be found in

143
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,660
some all work a

144
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,140
then all talk a bit about the high-tech
to

145
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,680
I thank you sir introduce as we're on
the same I'm

146
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,979
period 1996 and

147
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,250
has a key length of forty a bit so it's
between the city and

148
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,890
and the keylock we showed last year in
the

149
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,740
in our paper that did actually
complexity is only 22 37 encryptions

150
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,710
which you can use the computer room on a
laptop

151
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,760
and well on this

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,090
a on this particular ciphers is also
quite a a widely use product there was

153
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,760
quite some

154
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,660
quite some publications on sensor 2010 9

155
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,270
I'm this is progressive is he replaced
by I the tree which is also proprietary

156
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,120
but also there's some I think pro

157
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,370
variant which is using a yes yeah

158
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,630
so lemme revisit the bitter

159
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,080
high-tech to what I showed last year and
I just summarize the key issue she found

160
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,310
and

161
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,540
so so what kinda weaknesses did you
identify so

162
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,000
basically that the cryptographic
algorithm was a proprietary algorithm

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,460
was not community review and I've had a

164
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,670
very I'm your

165
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,170
particular structure so-so a I'm
rerouted to design

166
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm we cassidy's the strength of this
magnificent

167
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,440
and we publish about well our
observations were the

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,130
was a a week cipher design bet you could
the initialization was

169
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,000
was a pretty short also I i'm

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,260
invertible so if you abuse at some point

171
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,140
you could you go over to stay internal
saves cipher you could

172
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,170
rollback referring to regional mutual
stage reach

173
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,219
then review the key done

174
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,100
so basically %uh summarizes that
security was significantly lower than

175
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,350
that between size

176
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,290
so there were some implementation states
as well

177
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,240
so there was no randomness from from
within to transform so the chip

178
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,690
basically in the dark

179
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,970
and know what I mentioned before

180
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,220
also the do a secret key updated

181
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,860
was not one up atomic operation so if a
key is stored in multiple memory blocks

182
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,550
are you

183
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,599
update from and you want to update the
Keen

184
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,040
and you have to do multiple rights
operations than

185
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,400
means that the of way at what stage

186
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,980
are you down you don't have a new key
don't have your ski

187
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,050
I'm so so basically this should be one

188
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,949
operation them and while the improper
use by car manufacturers

189
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,530
there are many many chung transponders
were configured

190
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,650
we actually founded in a in and some

191
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:59,260
experience we did with their with the
default or easy to guess passwords and

192
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,330
and the well the cars were also

193
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,370
some cars Rick figured with weird
weekends

194
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,960
I can imagine if you have a weeki weed
with a

195
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,050
certain parts in the beginning on %um
not really use

196
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,120
and answer be completely drops and you
can find recovered secret can

197
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm drastically fast so

198
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,290
room whether the practicality uses a of
this high-tech to redact

199
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,829
I am but there are certain since it is
not

200
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,560
not also opening the cars

201
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,239
there's a lot more infor so based which
have to do is

202
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,240
you communicate with the car can because
you need to identify I showed that the

203
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,380
new beginning that

204
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,330
rescue me tonight and fired to to let a
car

205
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,540
at knowledge from did your known you're
in the white is now

206
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,160
a you have to do that and are therefore
you have to be in close proximity you

207
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,640
for

208
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,050
of your victim than you bypass the

209
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,599
security measures of a car which means
you have to force

210
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,970
locks disable the alarm and

211
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,210
force ignition mark as well because
you're

212
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,310
its just more to heart white stuff no
word

213
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,599
hammer or screwdriver or I'm them when
you

214
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,330
um you have to he's dropped the
immobilizer so that the message is

215
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,200
coming out with a act then a

216
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,670
around ignition lock then again you have
to communicate with the car can you get

217
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,250
because

218
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,730
you it's not enough to miss it too car
needs

219
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,420
messages from key and together you

220
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,510
you can do you could former computer

221
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,860
complex or mathematical computation you
can recover to seek

222
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,320
if you I've done all this so including
going through car

223
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,140
going to Keegan both sides then you can
go back to the car and you can handle a

224
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,630
picky

225
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,300
you can going to start car so basically

226
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,229
this is not really a practical way to
see you car and and

227
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:11,230
thats at least I wouldn't see I'm

228
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,840
manuscripts 0 our just that that very
briefly

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,150
in in this sense I'm

230
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,610
its introduce as well in 995 996 is
around the same miss

231
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,090
the new ones approving previously show

232
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,670
I'm the keel and Wilson 96 bits

233
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,729
so which is pretty good if you see that
you see

234
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,000
96 bits that should be very

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,840
strong insensitive of answer

236
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,380
but yeah we identified actually arm

237
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,610
very comparable weaknesses to what we
find in high-tech to

238
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,150
or what are described for I am

239
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,730
the practicality of that Act are really
seen similar in

240
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,740
in in how are you sure you know are you
know you can attack

241
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,740
a I said as we found in the high-tech to

242
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,790
you need the car and you can and do all
the steps

243
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,469
bob is key in this is still deployed in
cars screen

244
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,650
so that let me address the responsible
disclosure part of this

245
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,660
so what what ya let's first arc about

246
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,719
in general how does it work so

247
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,010
what you see you know the jurors in
issue you you identified a weakness

248
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,270
in a product that was there for a long
time and maybe use abuse but

249
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,890
not publicly known an you identify this
problem

250
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,010
and then you notify the problem only the
key problem owner

251
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,340
early on in early stage for you have

252
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,860
factual reasons a a pesky

253
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,940
you help them understand what you saying
because not always the

254
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,120
unionist and artworks

255
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,150
and a you publish them after a delay

256
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,530
sorry if you look at the recommendations
from a few then you have surged

257
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,949
I'm saying forty five days a Google
recommend sixty-day even drop that

258
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,440
I i've seen but yeah understanding a
recommendation is

259
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,050
sixty I guess and and from

260
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,689
at the Dutch government and there there
are some a

261
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,970
recently guidelines from Houston's how
to to handle this kind of

262
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,170
response with disclosure issues and then
they say well you have sixty days

263
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,670
should yes you should be reasonable time
for software

264
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,140
but hardware yeah you not always have
every

265
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,410
are drinking vice easy upgradeable well

266
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,490
nowadays are hardware runs

267
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,730
mostly software and runs firmware or
some other so far apart

268
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,740
but over does not a essentially mean
that is connected to the internet but

269
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,370
you can just

270
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,300
uploads so they say well there's is more
reasonable to give

271
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,069
hard for peace a some longer

272
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,270
ought to give due to manufacture overall
are true peace

273
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,230
longer time to prepare such thing to
prepare a response

274
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,110
and so their guidelines say six months
in a sense

275
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,329
are basically that's also what what we a
I'm

276
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,740
worry for so I am

277
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,400
are responsible disclosure in in this
sense we've done some some work

278
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,620
on on various topics and on

279
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,580
most widely known one mister my for
classic case

280
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,169
where we a we wanted to publish

281
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,720
our findings which we

282
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,130
which was actually contest them in court
by by manufacture an XP

283
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm this is our open court case a

284
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,320
and into for texas also just just public
and

285
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,899
they been lost we published after six
months

286
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,480
also relations to very good with an XP

287
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,250
afterwards but it was just your we had
another state of mind at that moment

288
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,990
so well was so moderate samples an
eternity phones from Nokia

289
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm in us while we punch up to six
months in in with at my crib to memory

290
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,140
as well published up to six months and
say mister high-tech to paper

291
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,270
last year Republic up to six months and

292
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,320
basically when we notified all the
Spartans

293
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,210
I'm date they contact us within 48 hours

294
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,930
or by a fire phone or or even on our
doorsteps

295
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,670
so

296
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,070
so so it was a real interaction

297
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,399
so up room well there's another thing
I'm

298
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,880
if you find issue a you have some kind
of notification

299
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,440
change because and do

300
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,550
more we learn from previews notify
partners is it actually

301
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,830
they demand for most the day communicate
with their customers

302
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,860
and hat couple resumes a for that
because

303
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,899
unit so we should not talk to them
because are

304
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,600
responder is actually bear
responsibility to do not define it

305
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,189
and a I'm also due to this party said
that

306
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,800
did the do not want to share customer
information with us

307
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,760
and and we not always know the customers
or

308
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,150
arm and also they know exactly who to
contact

309
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,280
so yup we we

310
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,590
we basically agreed them then search
strategies or

311
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,590
that's what we also

312
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,850
I've done since and and also encourage

313
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,959
I'm not to fight party to do

314
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,790
to take responsibility and to share with
the grass missus

315
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,040
quickly as possible so we know 25

316
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,300
a from in america most cases chip
manufacturer in

317
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,800
in twice in 2012

318
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,240
what is your email but we also need to
reduce the vmail

319
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,170
I'm I after a while

320
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,290
we gaming in discussion and we have
quite some collaboration we had a

321
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,629
conference call

322
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,780
several letters and emails personal
meeting

323
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,950
I constructive discussions but now at
the real

324
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:25,950
customer level Sonus pictured it is that
the car manufacturer you have no comp

325
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,300
were and so I want to address a believe
the reverse engineering

326
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,460
a matters and also related working there

327
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,030
so we have a.m. as a sole what is
possible if you reverse engineer

328
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,129
in you knew a I'm in an output looking
at the black box

329
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,880
you decompile firmware software are you
do to chip slicing

330
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
and and there's a quite a new approach

331
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,990
I wanna go BB YouTube i think is
promising

332
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,160
to do they actually need to refer to
side-channel attack

333
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,990
such an analysis so

334
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,410
well observe any input and the output
over

335
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,720
as how can reverse engineering data in
that sense

336
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,810
well bone out all showed that already
and

337
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,470
in here do snakes that a could just

338
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:25,860
look and set certain from initial state
in a cipher and looked in the

339
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,240
outgoing encryption bits an

340
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,320
it tried to to find a what those

341
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,310
the function that generated we did the
same with there are my for class

342
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,879
paper well we have internal stave
rituals earning your feedback shift

343
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,130
register and we

344
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,400
just puts up some bits there re you flip
the bits and looked in the output and

345
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,810
I'm

346
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,080
tried to fight him balance to a function

347
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,699
and it's a point well you have a bone in
their ways you can just comforting to

348
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,870
have fun

349
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,040
um I was also applied in a in the the
cordless phone

350
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,060
analysis done by your by

351
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,350
by so for people and looks at all

352
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,389
I guess is 10 where the the showed

353
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,610
how to attack the other indication for
Dex cordless phone

354
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,870
so what what to do with the with the
firmware others

355
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,250
for example Houston

356
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,250
a and several other papers and

357
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,920
you have a this paper showing a how how
you can

358
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,400
abuses in a car the I'm

359
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,320
you do so for running in a car and how
you can kind of change or a kinda for in

360
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,909
Jax

361
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,410
and stuff into for Americana some
militia messages

362
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,820
and let the car do several things you
know it should

363
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,159
your users you'd expect from also
demonstrated 2011

364
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,800
very interesting interesting torque I'm

365
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,370
a reason at all show the this Sat phones

366
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,389
aren't really so secure us we think
maybe

367
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,610
and they did by just looking at the
firmware of the Sat phone and the

368
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,760
be compiled with got the the prior

369
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,500
proprietary algorithm out and actually
show that the arguments week

370
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,260
an has several issues security issues

371
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,940
well most recently Miller and a follow a
sec showed in in

372
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Def Con 2013 I'm that they can also do

373
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,210
well you maybe or auction north koreans

374
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,710
research in a data showed you can you
can I'm

375
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,250
actually make debris covered car not

376
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,560
work anymore so you can over ruled the

377
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,570
certain very important

378
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,590
safety features over car

379
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,699
fired you sir electronic Boerse computer

380
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,960
Clark so this this was some

381
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,190
so I there's an then we have to reverse
engineering about chip slicing

382
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,620
and there are several papers using this
this particular way to reverse engineer

383
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,790
and Nessa and Anderson interesting
papers a

384
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,790
pictures America silicon zoo website

385
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,870
showing I'm really how to gates

386
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,850
drink and what the real present & Sons

387
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,230
so term yes there's a the

388
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,570
access to the the mega malls crypto
argument so

389
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,379
it's it's its publicly already

390
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,260
spratt because the be judgment is online

391
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,540
an of the interim injunction

392
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,428
their sources also do we use a tangle
programmer

393
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,910
which offers publicly available I am

394
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,170
so basically by the contains the Megabus
cryptogram

395
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,840
obfuscate not encrypt it but obfuscated

396
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,149
and you guys know im you and I mean by

397
00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,060
a non-technical person has quite some
difficult you understand

398
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,560
um it was cold murky but a judge

399
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,050
mmm but yeah surprised us because that's
it available since 2009

400
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,470
and it still busy being distributed as
an official product

401
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,990
answered diagnostic system for car

402
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,830
from car transponders in

403
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,860
what surprise even more hazardous to
many many other sources

404
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,419
available which contains Ogren Witcher

405
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,700
easy access over just an average person
and not protected

406
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,090
nothing cryptic not obfuscate

407
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,230
drive it so publicly available its its

408
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,910
for sprite for us better

409
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,450
was pointedly like this so but then
again

410
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,210
Norris's Megabus cryptogram is actually
already partially

411
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,950
bob's at the I'm challenges to security
engineering you found us a summer school

412
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,240
from

413
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,740
crypt young Crysler big-name star Burke

414
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,130
presented their that he actually reverse
engineer in Megamall scripture chip

415
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,200
for your chip slicing I am

416
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,340
and he showed high resolution pictures
/a

417
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,949
logic gates arm a drawing over schematic

418
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,850
over capone governor a core component of
the manuscript to algorithm

419
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,159
and bus lights are publicly for
downloads

420
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,909
almost a year now

421
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:32,620
so I'll just goal to mitigation
alternatives

422
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,060
I am there are proposed a

423
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,168
quite something some stuff in the in the
literature and I will not cover it all

424
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:45,050
I'm so so if you have their room is and
I don't mention with

425
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,158
I'm sorry is not intentionally just
because the slights get to fuhrman

426
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,860
an but the and also the industry has
occurred across from

427
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,250
some impute here there's some
proprietary chips which is a

428
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,270
as a successor I mention them before I
to tree in

429
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,418
and the CAD but they're also

430
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,880
ones that that the band on on opening
crypsis than

431
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,940
like a yes I'm

432
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,040
so what was in there economic literature
nursery required in this one was a

433
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,980
certain

434
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,220
since I think it inspired also

435
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,470
since the the paper from bono at all
because in

436
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,230
from 2005 under just quite some some in

437
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,639
yeah contribution on the by their

438
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:35,889
academia on this level someone to point
out actually

439
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:40,330
the other chips from so there's a
high-tech

440
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,580
proline from NXP Semiconductors and

441
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,360
gonna run from Texas Instruments but
those are kind of close I could not find

442
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,320
much information

443
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,399
although the UCAS which is a good thing
I don't know how to use it

444
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,830
and and also yeah it's hard to see
actually

445
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,840
I'm what what do you what to do or

446
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,110
what the want to try to accomplish I'm

447
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,560
in this has actually was surprising to
see that there is a semiconductor

448
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,460
company

449
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,399
Atmel the took a different role and age
a

450
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,739
opened up and they say how we want them
open immobilizer stack

451
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,360
and the risk even saying their data
sheet the the

452
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,850
be wanted been they're designed to be
scrutinized by

453
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,879
my academia or just general public

454
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,600
so it's a it's interesting and it's a

455
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,370
it's also also nice to see that this is
a a contribution

456
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,530
it's arduous already your products which
are

457
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,830
now available for a few years am

458
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,629
I did they basically a your kind of

459
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,020
promotes public evaluation of the
product

460
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,290
so I want to point this out as a
specific a interesting

461
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,300
so the conclusion I'm

462
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,550
yet %uh the moment she has a focus on on
safety which is a good thing of course

463
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,610
because its import that's not enough on
security

464
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,408
and he still use a proprietary in
outdated algorithms

465
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:10,669
no which could definitely be better
because me learn

466
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,820
a lot already like in the last decades
you should not use that

467
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,710
you and America should consider some

468
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,149
new up dade model like like Patch
Tuesday

469
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:27,260
an app that uses maybe im been harmed in
a car sense but you can imagine that

470
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,090
when you drive your car for maintaining
into a garage

471
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,060
you can just to a quick update and most
in the car is already running in

472
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,178
in for american just in software

473
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:42,310
so you can have so for update model

474
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,020

475
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,550
darkens I'm sorry I cannot the answered

476
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,810
any questions from from the audience I'm

477
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,850
but I think we have a very nice lied to
and

478
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,050
and it's our historical claim for the
paper
