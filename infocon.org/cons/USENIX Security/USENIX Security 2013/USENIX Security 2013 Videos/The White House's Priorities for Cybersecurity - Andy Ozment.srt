1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,680
9 a.m. talk is not a good talk in a car

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,128
right you guys are all sleepy so please
start

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,259
in their coffee and now have been there
so

4
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:24,250
in my career I've been a programmer

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,160
I've done operational network security
been a researcher and now policymaker

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,409
and it occurred to me that use nicks has
actually been a milestone in each of

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,379
those stages

8
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:40,309
in 2001 I came to the USENIX security
symposium

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,129
as a net as a practitioner is a guy who
was responsible for securing a network

10
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,040
somebody who read sandy Cohen login and
look for tips

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,260
as to how I could better do that and
have a great time

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,339
this that was in Washington DC as well
and it was actually my first time in

13
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:57,189
washington DC since I was a kid

14
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:01,170
did not realize it's been a lot of my
life here

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,239
I might have a my time I checked out the
weatherman the lesser to

16
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:12,239
if I'd known that at the time I was
working on technical solutions to

17
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:13,610
security

18
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,689
I was you know literally responsible for
the day-to-day security even at work

19
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,779
what my proudest accomplishments was
writing a host-based

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,270
intrusion detection system we depleted
on our network

21
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,869
week I some my intrusions the very next
morning

22
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,319
actually thought it was a bug I mean I
figured I I just screwed something up

23
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,170
right and that led to three days a very
late nights

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,490
very long hours I identifying where
somebody was in our system in rooting

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,139
out a bit

26
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:45,399
super exciting times and I love what I
was doing

27
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,799
but I also realize that what I was doing
was

28
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,810
was important an amazing but it wasn't
gonna solve this problem

29
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,729
and a large-scale picture was a key part
of solving it but it wasn't gonna do

30
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,020
anything at the national level and I
realize that I was most intrigued about

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,319
how can we stop this larger scale back
we make the United States

32
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,359
as a nation more secure from cyber
threats

33
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,209
in DC I have to say cybersecurity
because that's the only thing anybody

34
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,150
understands

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,220
I'm just going to apologize when I was
in your chair I was like what is

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,270
cyber security is the dumbest term ever
up

37
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,930
you know information security has been
just fine information assurance if

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,890
you've got that mindset it's been just
fine for many many years why do we have

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,970
to reinvent this term

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,290
sorry that's that's the world I live in
now

41
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,260
unfortunately so I moved on I went to
academia

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,359
I started life as a researcher up a
research was some

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,480
very impressive capable people who are
actually in this room

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,649
and I realize that was super exciting

45
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,560
that was a great way to contribute to
cybersecurity and in fact I came to use

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,090
nixon presented a paper

47
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,850
in 2006 so that was the second time
USENIX security symposium

48
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,000
was a milestone for me I'll noted that
time

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,790
but I was scheduled for the keynote room
but they thought my paper was a little

50
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,790
too niece so they bumped me out a bit
move me to the smaller room

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,860
promises crowd in the small room lot to
people like this where up

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,990
and through from their own in the
government worth it

53
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,050
for a while the department defense
sometime in the National Security Agency

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,330
sometime Department of Homeland Security
and finding out the white house

55
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,680
and here we are my sort of third
milestone

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,940
appearance USENIX security symposium I'm

57
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,220
I will note that it all those previous
times if I came I saw speaker wearing a

58
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,300
suit and tie I was like oh this bodes
ill

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,400
this is not going to get speech up sorry

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,780
that's that it's a its completely
mandatory uniform for us in government

61
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,910
hopefully it doesn't bode ill

62
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,750
okay so what is my job right now

63
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,250
I am essentially the deputy to the
cybersecurity coordinator

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,950
so he's got two deputies one for
national security issues one for

65
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,190
homeland security issues

66
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,150
I'm the guy who focuses on homeland
security issues was at me

67
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,450
it means critical infrastructure
protection

68
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,829
securing the government working on
cybersecurity legislation

69
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,109
privacy and civil liberties issues

70
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,750
and information-sharing but

71
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,550
today amid talk about everything that we
do from from our office in the white

72
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,150
house

73
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,599
everything that we're worried about from
the administration's perspective

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,040
and then focus on critical
infrastructure protection

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,070
so talk about three main things today

76
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,349
the first are our priorities from the
white house and sorta buckets by which

77
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,420
we think about the cyber security
problem

78
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,360
the second is the cybersecurity
executive order that the president

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,950
announced the state in the Union in
February

80
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,729
and the third is cybersecurity
legislation and what we're trying to do

81
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,190
with congress

82
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,920
and then leave a lot of time for
questions so please be thinking of

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,420
questions along the way

84
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,970
I'm right down so did tree to know pat's
the hard questions and the easy

85
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,870
questions

86
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,790
and then at the end to the the speech
here take the hard questions crumple

87
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,010
them up and come up to the

88
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,700
microphone to the easy questions

89
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,409
hack my guys gonna work with me right
now it's 9 a.m. time

90
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,700
I hate so what are our priorities

91
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,050
no from the perspective the White House
how do we but getting the work that

92
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,570
we're doing

93
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,880
to improve cybersecurity nationwide

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,139
so we have five to protect critical
infrastructure

95
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,000
to secure the government to engage
internationally

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,680
to prove incident response and to shape
the future

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,880
I'm going to need to those five in turn
before I do so though I think it's worth

98
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,639
recognizing that

99
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,480
we understand that the government is not
going to solve this problem

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,070
we're all gonna solve this problem
together this is not something the

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,190
government can

102
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,660
if we only have a little bit better
policies are higher few more people

103
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,780
we can just improve cybersecurity in the

104
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,650
a a make sure our nation is secure can
happen that way

105
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,159
won't happen that way requires olive you

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,850
to do your work to secure whatever it is
you're responsible for securing

107
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,480
to raise awareness about this issue and
to make sure people understand it's

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,419
important

109
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,969
but they dedicate the resources
necessary you build in security from the

110
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,710
very beginning

111
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,859
and so we do all of that we're not gonna
make progress

112
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,930
I'm so well I'm also going to talk about
what we're doing in the government

113
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,130
please realize that that's only a small
part of the solution to the problem

114
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,000
okay so let me go 3-2 those priorities
in turn

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,510
the first is to protect critical
infrastructure

116
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,280
we've really gone about that into
primary ways

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,919
one is to establish voluntary standards

118
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,240
to raise the baseline of cybersecurity
across critical infrastructure

119
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,050
to raise awareness to the standards to
engage corporate leaders

120
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,550
to understand how important they are for
critical infrastructure

121
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,639
and the second is to focus on
information sharing

122
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,030
sharing information both from the
government out to the private sector

123
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,400
but also from the private sector to
other private sector companies

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,210
from the private sector back to the
government now those are the topics at

125
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,299
the executive order

126
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,370
and the information-sharing legislation
but i wanna talk about later

127
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,240
so I'm gonna put those aside for now and
move on to the second priority

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,130
the second priority is to secure the
government

129
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,169
how do you guys think the government has
top-notch security

130
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,310
we don't have anybody breaking in I
we've got it covered

131
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,020
go ahead reserve so that was a safe one
the new you tired enough to raise your

132
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,479
hand anyway

133
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,520
up alright so you obviously not

134
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,969
right we we have problems the government
does get broken into

135
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,520
we do suffer intrusions up there some
areas the government are doing extremely

136
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,130
well

137
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,150
but there are others that government the
really need to catch up

138
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,130
so how do you deal with that at the
highest level how does the white house

139
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,520
insure that security is prioritize

140
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,190
and that security something that's
really happening across the entire

141
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,790
federal government it's a tough job

142
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,650
right we're talking up millions of
computers

143
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,659
millions of people %uh and

144
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,060
who knows how many different departments
and agencies you can count on like eight

145
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,919
different ways

146
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,139
on going to that so the short answer is
you do that

147
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:41,289
the way you solve any management
challenge from a very senior level

148
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,290
to establish priorities you establish
metrics

149
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,270
and you see used Abbas targets for those
metrics here's where I expect you to be

150
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,870
the following about it I'm and work with
you and get this resource

151
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,630
so you have the funds to make this
happen and hold you accountable for

152
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,250
making it happen

153
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,660
is nothing magical about that so

154
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,010
what's our process for doing that the
government

155
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,630
up on the unclassified side we had
something called the cross agency

156
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,880
priority goals

157
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,680
you can hear like eighty terrible
acronyms for me I'm just gonna warn you

158
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,709
I mean that's how we roll

159
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,550
the government so this is the cap goals
across agency priority goals

160
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,160
up we have three goals for the cap

161
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,949
the first is to implement trusted
internet connections

162
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,510
so what is this well this is 101 this is
what you were doing

163
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,689
fifteen years ago of your network
security this is consolidating your

164
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,589
network connections to run through

165
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,350
a finite number of gateways you thinkin

166
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,910
you guys haven't done that yet you don't
know where all your connections to the

167
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,589
Internet are that's kinda scary

168
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:48,720
yeah at that is kinda scary up

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,930
I will plead at least that the scale of
the challenge in the government

170
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,160
is for the best when we started this
project we had

171
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,270
up I can't tell you exactly how many we
have because we thought we had like six

172
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,970
thousand connections to the Internet or

173
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,970
no we had tens of thousands have
connections to the Internet

174
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,529
up every time we find

175
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,370
every time we think we're making
progress we find a whole slew of

176
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,649
connections that we never knew existed

177
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,899
but the good news is that we are making
progress slowly

178
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,800
sometimes we move backwards as we
discover new question new connections

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,180
but we are over time consolidating and
so we will have moved from tens of

180
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,250
thousands a connection to the Internet

181
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,060
to about 50 connections to the Internet
as you all know

182
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,969
WA premier security isn't the only
answer we're not going for the hard sell

183
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,750
the

184
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,480
smooshy inside up but also if you don't
have firmer security

185
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
you're in real trouble if for nothing
else than it's harder to detect the

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,290
exultation

187
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,579
as as your information flows outward in
ways that you never plan for

188
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,700
so that's the first to these priorities
for securing our

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,959
unclassified networks the second
priority

190
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,279
is called HSBC 12 again because we're
never

191
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,770
the snazzy africans a essentially this
is two factor authentication

192
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,829
so in about 2004 the government came up
with these

193
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,100
cards called PIV cards personal
identifying verification cards

194
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,390
up that are simply a smart card up and
their

195
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,010
the goal was unified physical and
logical access

196
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,360
so the goal was I is a government
employee could show up any different

197
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,209
department

198
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,540
and to get in the building I would have
to not to show this card which is where

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,730
we are now right show your driver's
license

200
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,399
but actually sick the car in a reader
enter my PIN

201
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,220
I'm and then they would get real time
information as to whether I was still a

202
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,500
government employee

203
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,320
see my picture flash up on screen in 60
be able to do a physical verification

204
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,500
tied to logical verification so then I
walk in this building

205
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,020
i sat down on my computer a plug my car
into a reader

206
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,069
ob and that's my two factor
authentication even from my desktop

207
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,310
computer

208
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,579
and buy time those together we can also
say hey

209
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,080
andy is supposedly log in on this
computer but he's not in the building

210
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,470
that's probably not good

211
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,920
so this is a really tough challenge and
it's been made more tough course by the

212
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
evolution of how we use computers

213
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,329
so in 2004 2005 it was conceivable that
a smart card form factor would be the

214
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,160
entire solution to our problem

215
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,529
online authentication ob

216
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,000
how many have you have picked up your
iPhone or your

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,269
blackberry up and found the little card
reader slot on it

218
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,800
again like this is safe I know you're
not gonna raise your arms it's 9 a.m.

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,670
so none there are no card readers
obviously and so

220
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,439
you can't say alright what is this
two-factor authentication standard mean

221
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,990
as we move to a place

222
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,670
%uh were logging in from home more often
where we have

223
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,269
mobile devices who whose form factors
aren't suited to the idea of a card

224
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:02,420
and that's something we're struggling
with I won't tell you we have

225
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,750
an ideal solution their temporary
solutions there are ways we can accept a

226
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,300
little bit more risk

227
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,170
but it's not a perfect solution at all
I'm that being said what we can

228
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,890
absolutely push to completion on

229
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,470
is desktops right so we still have
plenty of desktops in the government

230
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,380
we have all these card readers on them
there's no reason we can't be using

231
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,370
these

232
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,750
cards to authenticate ourselves and use
two factor authentication on the desktop

233
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,980
you d by the way has done a great job
with this I N is really already there

234
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,910
DOD Department defense so the rest the
government is now catching up

235
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,569
so that was our second party for within
the government the third priority for

236
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,470
the government

237
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,180
is continuous monitoring now it's a
little like 915 now someone asks a

238
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,000
question are expected to raise our hands
are very

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,750
pay attention now how many of you have
heard of continuous monitoring

240
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,690
haha right OKC finally some hands looked
shy hands though they're like

241
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,750
be on their oh there we go

242
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,600
there we go batman is proud to know
about continues my ring

243
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,029
okay I

244
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,430
alright okay we got a revival going out
this is good

245
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,829
so continuous monitoring from our
perspective

246
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:18,849
about at the highest level is really
about

247
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,649
two things it's about measuring how
secure we r

248
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,690
knowing all the time how many
vulnerabilities to we have their own

249
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,079
patched

250
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,790
how many systems we have whose
configuration has deviated from our

251
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,110
standard configuration

252
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,380
but it's also about incentivizing and
this gets lost a lot the conversation

253
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,380
the places that have been most
successful continuous monitoring

254
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,490
essentially have dashboards report cards

255
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,540
um to go all the way down the
operational levels the organization

256
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,519
where a system administrator can come in
in the morning and say look

257
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,510
I'm a guy who cares about security up
I've got a million things I have to do

258
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,569
I know that I will never be able to put
enough time in securities I want to put

259
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,230
him back in

260
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,100
I can carve out an hour this morning to
work on some security problems

261
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,200
we don't want that person has been the
hour trying to figure out

262
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,610
what to work on we want them to very
clearly no

263
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,540
pay biggest problem you've got right now
is this one patch

264
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,439
that is for a vulnerability we know is
being exploited and you haven't solved

265
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,779
it

266
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:23,439
help us out get this install really
quickly or your firewall configuration

267
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,730
is

268
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,130
is totally messed up so we want to
provide that information

269
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,680
right at their fingertips so that when
they come in the morning didn't have to

270
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,149
sit around think what is the best thing
for me to do

271
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:36,230
on security today at the same time as we
go up

272
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,040
to their bosses to the people who are
responsible for a given system

273
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,860
we want to create a little from the
competition and so they get scorecards

274
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,800
to

275
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,060
and they see how they stand with respect
to their peers

276
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,699
are they in a top percentile in the
bottom percentile if there is a certain

277
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,630
point

278
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,300
below the average up they're gonna get
first the letter

279
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,819
saying hey this is a problem if nothing
happens we're gonna act on it

280
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,060
and then eventually phone calls and
increasingly

281
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,109
unpleasant activity from their
management

282
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,610
so we combine this system for both
visibility

283
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,019
an incentive is incentivize Asian
continues myron

284
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,279
this is really tough so at the easiest
age

285
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,850
you know you're monitoring your Windows
computers it's a pretty doable thing

286
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,540
we need to get to a point for monitoring
pretty much anything with an IP address

287
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,959
on our networks

288
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,089
I and that means a lot to devices that
right now are really tough to monitor

289
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,019
where there may not be a standard
configuration over there may not even be

290
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,850
a tool that enables us to do them on

291
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,190
but that's the plan for continues monica
so those are three goals

292
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,779
for securing the government continues
pondering

293
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,410
it just beat well simply two-factor
authentication

294
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,050
and trusted internet connections
essentially consolidating our internet

295
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,939
connections through secure gateways

296
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,389
alright so hopefully you I realize this
is tough without a a slide that

297
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,310
sometimes of all the structure

298
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,720
up I could have slides within white
house lawyers would like

299
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,130
leap out the walls and assassinate me
we're not really keen on

300
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,889
on having written down things yeah I
realize they'll be basally entertaining

301
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:15,819
for you guys but it would really

302
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,459
not be as fun for me I so

303
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,540
here's where we stand so we can talk
about the

304
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,609
the priorities the government the first
I've the administration for

305
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,270
cybersecurity first was to protect
critical infrastructure

306
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,639
gonna come back to you the second was to
secure the government so I just told you

307
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,669
about our priorities in that space

308
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:37,690
the third is to engage internationally
so it

309
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,610
if you deal with cybersecurity on a
daily basis you thinkin oh man

310
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,799
I can have the greatest defenses in the
world but if people feel no consequence

311
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,200
for continuing to try to intrude upon me
then

312
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,490
I'm venture gonna lose right they're
gonna get in at some point so how do we

313
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,840
raised the cost how do we encourage the
most

314
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,559
advanced actors to not constantly be
trying to intrude

315
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,399
as an aside on notice that I i really
use the word intrude

316
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,330
different from the word attack so that's
something that's really important to us

317
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,689
I think if you read most newspaper
articles everything's an attack

318
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,799
up if you look at this from the
international perspective

319
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,889
it really makes a big difference you
start talking about attacking people

320
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,230
start talking about

321
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,490
I love things like have you cross red
lines

322
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,580
to be attacking response and if we
attack in response when he attacked with

323
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,480
bombs

324
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,480
and bullets and so these things matter
these distinctions make a difference

325
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,470
whereas intrusions other we don't like
them

326
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,510
fall under a fairly traditional round
the best be in touch

327
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,010
up with one distinction that I'll come
back to you

328
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,490
okay so we're engaging internationally
we're trying to raise the cost for

329
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,240
adversaries for their

330
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,679
efforts to intrude upon our attackers up

331
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,610
how do we do that if you're on the
outside if you're on the front lines

332
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,668
trying to secure your

333
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,500
systems it looks like the government
isn't doing anything it's probably very

334
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,140
very frustrating

335
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,750
certainly was when I was working in that
space

336
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,980
and the reality is the change the
government can accomplish

337
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,270
at that scale is going to be really
really slow

338
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,730
so this is not a problem that we can
solve in in one year

339
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,460
or two years if we make significant
progress in five years I'll be very

340
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,690
happy

341
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,929
so okay sucky teasing you but not on you
overdoing

342
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,950
right I'm one thing we're doing is we're
engaging the Chinese government

343
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,470
again if you've been reading the papers
you've probably seen this

344
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,190
it started about six or eight months ago

345
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,750
we started raising this issue
increasingly vocally

346
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,929
and there's there's a sort of formal
dance for how you do this typeof

347
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:44,990
diplomacy

348
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,480
you start by by singing saying things in
a few speeches

349
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,640
you start raising increasingly vocally
then you start

350
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,270
perhaps talking about the media I'm and
then you end up

351
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,830
where you form a working group says
government we solve problems by talking

352
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,750
people

353
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,220
so we formed a working group with the
chinese government

354
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,150
at the strategic and economic dialogue
and we first tell that working group in

355
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,760
July

356
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,730
we feel very pleased with the outcome
about working group and we hold a lot I

357
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,600
hope

358
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,178
for how we can make progress in that
space again it's not gonna be rapid

359
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,400
progress

360
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,140
up want the key points that we're trying
to make

361
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,570
is that there is essentially a normal
behavior with respect

362
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,340
espionage that distinguishes economic
espionage

363
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,620
and traditional espionage traditionalist
be nice

364
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,780
is all about governments stealing their
military

365
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,280
government secrets from other
governments that's been around

366
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,850
kind of a while it's probably going to
be around for a while

367
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,120
economic espionage is different economic
espionage is when a government

368
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,510
steals secrets from a private sector
company

369
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,049
and handsome to a private sector company
in their own nation

370
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,429
for that company's economic benefit
about stealing

371
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,720
the purposes of advancing Euro nations
companies

372
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,330
that is something that is really not
acceptable

373
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,699
and that most nations recognize is not
acceptable and that's a distinction

374
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,169
we're really trying to hammer home

375
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,200
we're also working with the russians so

376
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,620
this news was it really widely picked up
on but about

377
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,939
six weeks ago now I think maybe eight
weeks we announced that we had started

378
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,190
her

379
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,320
a series of confidence-building measures
with the Russian government with respect

380
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,010
to cybersecurity

381
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,940
so those are the results have a very
lengthy

382
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,340
very said negotiations

383
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,889
include some things like essentially a
red phone

384
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,929
for cyber security incidents small steps

385
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:53,049
you know better connecting our certs is
a small steps but they are the ways the

386
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:53,710
government's

387
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,600
build confidence with each other and
reach a point where they can make more

388
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,189
significant steps

389
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,030
so that's the priority of engage
internationally the fourth priority is

390
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,690
to improve

391
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,799
incident response now about

392
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,950
a year ago we had a national level
exercise

393
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,039
Azimi US hear about this national level
exercise

394
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,240
okay few folks in the front alright so

395
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,720
some folks did you essentially national
level exercise these are primarily

396
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,100
focused on

397
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,168
physical incidence or historically they
happen

398
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:30,960
ob they happen every two years this
year's an off-year

399
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,330
next year will be in on your a the one
part of the cybersecurity one

400
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,689
was a simulated earthquake the New
Madrid fault

401
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,559
up which encompasses a a rather large
number of state so this is the kind of

402
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,610
thing we're

403
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,830
since even think of this is FEMA working
with state and local governments to

404
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,860
practice

405
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,510
responding to a major incident like a
major hurricane a major earthquake

406
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,460
you name it well we did one last year
for cybersecurity

407
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,510
up it wasn't perfect I think

408
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,890
a lot of folks in it were like okay this
is a little bit of an unrealistic

409
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,559
scenario

410
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,410
unquestionably true up the point though
isn't necessarily validity in the

411
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,090
scenario

412
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:15,039
its can we create a scenario that causes
us to exercise all the muscles that we

413
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,360
won exercise

414
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,639
I think we did a great job now the good
news is

415
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,789
is we did this exercise we tested how
the government

416
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:26,169
in the private sector and state and
local governments would respond to a

417
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:28,370
cyber security incident and it was
perfect

418
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,389
we know how to do it will be on in the
snap no problem

419
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,820
now not so much yeah heard some chuckles
and the people who participated

420
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,510
up you do exercises to figure out what's
broken

421
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,549
what you don't know how to do and boy we
figured out was broken in what we don't

422
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,639
know how to do

423
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,260
up that's it sounds like bad news it's
actually good news that's what exercises

424
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,520
are four you want to discover that in an
exercise

425
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,850
not the real incident so

426
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,649
we spent a year working on improving are
incident response capabilities

427
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,669
we've also had this very handy situation
where

428
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,960
we've had almost a year now have
sustained

429
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,990
significant denial of service attacks
against the financial services sector

430
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,039
so we've got to work on an incident
response live i'm for about a year

431
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,879
and as you would expect we started off
pretty badly

432
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,669
I think a good example this is words
when it started

433
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,169
we would get thousands of IP addresses

434
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:31,020
from different parts the private sector
primarily financial institutions

435
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,150
saying look is the IP addresses the guys
who are

436
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,530
I dial service attacking us

437
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,600
we would consolidate them clean them up
given to the ISP's

438
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,168
so that's a very helpful useful job %uh

439
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,559
itself when it takes is two weeks

440
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,770
which is what it did the first time so

441
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,158
the style service tax starts up every
day you guys know how pots

442
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,500
evolve over time right IP addresses two
weeks after the attack

443
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,480
yeah those pots don't exist anymore
that's not helpful

444
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,960
all up

445
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,350
in the immortal words have the money by
buying character

446
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,610
we got better home we're now at this
pace of doing that

447
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,928
in minutes or hours we still need to get
better

448
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,990
but we've made significant progress

449
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:29,280
alright the final priority I want to
talk about is to shape the future

450
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,530
kinda sounds fuzzy right um

451
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,770
but I think we all recognize that the
way things are structured right now

452
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,809
in cyberspace is that

453
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,740
the attacker has the edge now

454
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,210
I'm it harder defender like I said I
started my career defending a network

455
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,919
up that's the problem space I love I
think it's harder to do

456
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,340
then attacking I think it's more
important its easy be one of those red

457
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,639
team weenies

458
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,760
but it takes you know real courage to be
a

459
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,890
to be a guy defending the network

460
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,320
but the reality is is the odds against
us were in Vegas or playing against the

461
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,559
house

462
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,629
I'm an attacker and I can keep trying
and persistent enough

463
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,809
I will eventually getting so that's one
reason

464
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,850
as I said that we're engaging with our
with other nations that the

465
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,820
international stage

466
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,908
but in another thing we need to do is
try to

467
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:26,250
help the defenders of aids and so that's

468
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,260
shaping the Internet for example that's
DNS sec

469
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,600
helping to develop promulgate protocol
like the in a sec

470
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,639
and now routing security

471
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,820
thats things like building cybersecurity
workforce

472
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,570
so that we have people were trained and
skilled will help us solve these

473
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,879
problems

474
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,610
and its research and development in the
systems that will be inherently less for

475
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,750
ability

476
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,669
inherently less formal or programming
methods that will be to you

477
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:59,690
more secure systems over time

478
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,970
so those were the white house's
priorities write protect critical

479
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,860
infrastructure

480
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,330
secure the government engage
internationally improve incident

481
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,199
response

482
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,320
and shape the future alright

483
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,299
let me go over the executive order on
improving critical infrastructure

484
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,408
cybersecurity

485
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,000
the president announced this is the
Steve Union last year is a big deal

486
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,080
up to our knowledge cybersecurity

487
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,090
or computer security or information
security have only been mentioned twice

488
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,320
and Steve Union addresses one was the
prior February

489
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,580
when the president announced that he was
asking the Congress for legislation

490
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,010
and once was this February when the
president announced executive order

491
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,960
executive order good the this is the
time for you notice I'm all about lists

492
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,779
I I promise you when I type all this
stuff out I indented you squirrely

493
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:56,020
brackets and it's like it's like a
semicolons at the interviews lined

494
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,220
I mean it's like that seek voter comes
outta me um

495
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,630
but it's a little harder when I'm just
telling it to you so I'm gonna give you

496
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,279
another lists an hour in the

497
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,409
executive order approving critical
infrastructure cybersecurity

498
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:11,110
in an executive order we try to publish
for things

499
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,240
the first is information sharing

500
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,169
so I tell you it sometimes I get tired
information-sharing

501
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:22,590
the government's been talking about it
since 1998

502
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,928
it feels like a motherhood and apple pie
answer to the problem right like

503
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:27,380
government wants to share information

504
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,600
what's easy for the government to do
it's not that controversial

505
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,730
I its kinda way up punting on the harder
problems

506
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,419
sometimes I feel that way and sometimes
I think that's accurate

507
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,570
but there are other times when I i
really talk to folks

508
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,250
and they say yeah but there are real
things that we need from the government

509
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,360
real things we need to share with each
other

510
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,949
I'm and we can make a lot of progress
and that's also true so

511
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,390
I think there's truth on both sides
there what we really need on information

512
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,059
sharing

513
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:00,720
and a minimum is the ability to to tell
people when we have incidents

514
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,419
so we have a sense love the scale for
example

515
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,490
up a single intruders activities and a
share

516
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,980
indicators up intrusions because we need
to be in a space where

517
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,250
if an advanced adversary is caught in
one place

518
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,669
and we're all protected against that
adversary right now we're in the space

519
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:22,110
for it's really hard to catch an
advanced adversary

520
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,100
and everybody has to start from scratch
and that's not a good place to be

521
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,279
so we do need to share information we
need to share information

522
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,669
so that being caught or

523
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:35,580
are successfully defending yourself an
attack intruder in one place means that

524
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,600
we're all protect

525
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,760
so this executive order focuses on
information sharing from the government

526
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,809
out to the private sector

527
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,309
why is that is that because we think
it's the most important type of

528
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:49,039
information sharing

529
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,140
not at all in fact I would argue that
the combined knowledge to the private

530
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,740
sector

531
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,909
vastly exceeds that the government so
the there

532
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,039
you could say the very most important
information sharing to let

533
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,320
you in the private sector talk to each
other

534
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,480
now if you work in a small organization
you think that's easy right I just

535
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,510
call a guy %uh personal email whatever
we we talk

536
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,510
up large organizations that have lots of
lawyers

537
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,929
find that a little bit more challenging
but the executive order focuses on the

538
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,830
government sharing information outwards

539
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,230
because that's what the government can
do wonder a current authorities

540
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,250
that's what congress has set us up so we
can do right now

541
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,370
in our legislative efforts were pushing
for help on the other types of

542
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,760
information sharing and I'll come back
to that

543
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,929
so I for solution

544
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,010
under the executive order for and our
first attempt information sharing is

545
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,850
we're gonna issue or clearances

546
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,309
to critical infrastructure owners and
operators now this is really important

547
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:49,158
we do have classified information that
is useful for people who are responsible

548
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,850
for securing their networks

549
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,090
or is useful for educating their CEOs as
to why they need to invest in

550
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,389
cybersecurity

551
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,200
so we absolutely need to do that the
executive order task ths to start the

552
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,250
program up

553
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,299
and they have restarted I would love to
tell you that

554
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:08,340
that were in great shape now a that we
solve that problem we can move on

555
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,309
I can't say that yet DHS has started
this program in there and

556
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,629
giving essentially going to the process
of investigating people given is

557
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,809
clearances

558
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,940
we don't have people who've come out the
other end who have clearances yet

559
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,549
and we're not going to declare success
and so we have a steady pipeline to

560
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,889
people with clearances

561
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,970
but even when that program is working
successfully

562
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,399
it's not enough we cannot issue enough
clearances to everybody we need in

563
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:34,989
critical infrastructure

564
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,059
for them to be able to protect
themselves so we also have to change the

565
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,379
culture the government

566
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,570
and classify less we have two

567
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,539
change it so that we either take
classified information in the classifier

568
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,820
or recognize that it doesn't need to be
classified in the first place for the

569
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,000
ski parts for more information

570
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,640
so why don't we just do that why is that
so hard

571
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,570
when the truth is that there's there's
risk anytime you talk about

572
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,649
sharing information and from our
perspective so far information

573
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:10,428
we gather through intelligence I'm
sometimes that information

574
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,750
came from a person whose life could be
at risk effect if it gets too widely

575
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,529
dispersed

576
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:18,370
but even more than that even for
information is not that precious we

577
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,239
don't have to worry about reviewing the
sources much

578
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,429
we have found in certain cases when we
share information

579
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:28,460
Italy's it loses its value almost
immediately

580
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,740
we spent months I'm covering an
adversary

581
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,350
really learning about them developing
sophisticated signatures to help people

582
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,449
catch them

583
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,460
release those signatures and discovered

584
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,220
even not really some wildly you know
release them to just keep companies and

585
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,690
discovered that our adversaries change
their behavior within days

586
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,230
and so were in the strap were sometimes
we share information

587
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,460
it loses its value almost immediately on
the other hand we don't share the

588
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,070
information

589
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,470
doesn't have a heckuva lot a value there
either up so how are we doing with this

590
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,169
well the first is we can accept more
risk and that's really what the

591
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:05,460
executive order

592
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,460
accomplishes attacks the government with
increasing the volume

593
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,559
timeliness in quantity so in quality

594
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,299
up the thread information we provided
the private sector simply this is saying

595
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,529
the government agencies look

596
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,299
every time you gonna share information
you're going to a trade-off a

597
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,240
cost-benefit tradeoff is it worth
sharing this information will people

598
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,659
driving up benefit

599
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,429
or saying look you don't know the answer
to that sharing

600
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:32,169
when you're uncertain we feel like it's
even share it

601
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:35,299
there will still be times you choose not
to share information but when you're in

602
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:35,960
doubt

603
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,210
sharing accept the risk

604
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,380
at a key part of the solution but again
there will still be pieces of

605
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,419
information that we don't share

606
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,649
so what's our solution to that our
solutions a program called

607
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:53,489
enhanced cybersecurity services now

608
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,740
I feel like we do a terrible job
training and so I was like advocating

609
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,740
that we name this program

610
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,830
been her think that will be way cooler
up

611
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,980
nobody accepted that

612
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,990
it if you guys have better names I wanna
hear them question-answer session

613
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,869
gladiator something cool if you like in
the fifties and sixties the government

614
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:12,899
did a better job in naming

615
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,770
things art so enhance ever security
services

616
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,329
what is this what is this program up

617
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:24,879
I with this is an audience and that's a
quite lucky to have so I can only

618
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,768
explain it in these terms to the
audience as I speak to you

619
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:31,208
essentially we're talking about an
intrusion protection program

620
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:35,208
up an intrusion protection system that
uses classified

621
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,918
signatures so how does that work I

622
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,328
essentially the government gives
classified signatures

623
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,829
to private sector service providers and
the service providers have gone through

624
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:48,059
the program love having

625
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,440
people with clearances they have rooms
that are

626
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,069
since the accredited the store
classified information called skips

627
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:58,329
in Washington DC

628
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,459
so these and that's not cheap right so
the service providers have gone to that

629
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:02,368
effort

630
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,559
then a critical infrastructure company
let's you know

631
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,759
generic power plant I can now just pay

632
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:12,410
this service provider route some other
traffic through the Service Provider

633
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,288
and receive protection from the
signatures now this is an ideal

634
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:19,880
if your sophisticated company you
thinking all right I can send to my

635
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,979
traffic through what is essentially a
black box

636
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:26,640
have malicious traffic blocked but it
doesn't make me better at security right

637
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,420
cuz I don't get to figure out

638
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,140
what was it about this particular piece
a traffic that was malicious

639
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,249
what was the clue so that's frustrating
for you

640
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:38,538
but most companies aren't that
sophisticated so you look at the car

641
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,930
critical infrastructure

642
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,089
whole lot of small companies out there
municipal water supplies

643
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:47,739
small electric companies

644
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:51,519
you name it they aren't that
sophisticated and what they want is

645
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,999
just help us out help us protect
ourselves we're never going to have the

646
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,069
in-house capability

647
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:59,160
to do the sophisticated work so we're
always gonna be outsourcing it

648
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,229
this is a useful tool for us to have as
part of our

649
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:06,709
useful tool for us to have in our
toolbox it's not a silver bullet

650
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:10,509
we r promising that this will solve all
your problems absolutely what

651
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:14,029
and where we'd like for you to be is to
have a security operation center with

652
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:15,499
really smart people in it

653
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:20,049
detecting intruders kicking them out but
we realize that not every company is

654
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:21,150
going to be able to afford that

655
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:27,319
so this is a tool that helps those
particularly who can't afford it

656
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,599
alright second thing executive order
does

657
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,890
privacy and civil liberties so

658
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,680
this civil this executive orders about
the government sharing information

659
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,569
out to the private sector me not as many
privacy and civil liberties challenges

660
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:43,519
there

661
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,788
but there are still some in their people
were concerned

662
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:51,140
about what type of information for
example the government share

663
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,209
so we've done is create a privacy and
civil liberties oversight regime

664
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:58,558
they were quite proud of you can look at
the executive order and see how it works

665
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,410
out

666
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,049
make one thing the flag but if you're
not in the privacy advocacy community

667
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:06,390
you may not appreciate is we
specifically reference the fair

668
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,170
Information practice principles the
Phipps

669
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,380
so this is a set of principles have been
around since the nineteen seventies

670
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,739
that are really represent the stated
well still yards maybe not

671
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,969
for you to use to describe something
from nineteen seventies but represent

672
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:22,589
the best

673
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:26,670
thinking with respect to privacy
protections

674
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,680
for information is not a set of clear
rules you have to do this and this and

675
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,348
this

676
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,349
it's a framework for dealing with any
privacy problem in saying

677
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:36,979
these are the the different lenses you
have to bring to bear on its problem

678
00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:40,239
and how you need to address it

679
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,589
it's not perfect I think the privacy
advocacy community has also been arguing

680
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:44,719
about how to update it

681
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:51,489
since 1972 up but nobody has come up
with anything better yet

682
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:55,430
the third thing executive order does
standards

683
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,209
I'll how many view have a friend

684
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:05,399
who works at a company that has really
poor cybersecurity standards

685
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,930
I certainly do I this is your friend
right now your company

686
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,469
San a the reality is

687
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:17,910
their companies out there that have
amazing cybersecurity

688
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,799
that the government can learn from that
all of us in this room can learn

689
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,529
they're also companies out there that
are really struggling I'm

690
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,369
we send people out we have a sedative

691
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:36,369
folks give me some water here

692
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,520
we have a team for example at the HS

693
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,700
industrial control systems sir team that
gets called out

694
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,640
I voluntarily people critical
infrastructure just call and say hey

695
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,970
with you guys come take a look at our
systems and see how what we're doing

696
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,598
now the good news is

697
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,670
again sometimes they find companies that
are doing amazingly well

698
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,859
but a lot of time with a discover is

699
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,549
they go in and they talk to the CIO and
they say all right

700
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,230
you have these control systems that are
running your power plant supercritical

701
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,770
Bob the some folks make on SCADA systems

702
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,670
ICS industrial control systems whatever
these are the things that

703
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:24,339
they're running a power-play you CIO are
you confident

704
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:28,029
you have these protected so they can't
be readily access from the internet

705
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:33,160
CIO's like 0 yeah we haven't totally
segregated from the internet

706
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,910
or maybe we have one connection between
our business systems

707
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,259
and his control systems we've got it
super super secured

708
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,359
whatever we we know that we have strong
segregation he walked down to the

709
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,119
control room

710
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,140
it's the r8 Bob a

711
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,339
how do you get onto the air control
system

712
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:56,080
bob says old men it was a real pain in
the rear so we set up this wifi

713
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,310
a network so we could access it from the
control room

714
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,589
and that's working pretty well but they
weren't home it's harder to access so we

715
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,210
set up a dial in system

716
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,000
I so we have these modems lying around
in 20 years ago this to work so we

717
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,900
figured that's cool

718
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,050
%uh and these discover that there in
fact all sorts of connections and

719
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,849
Internet facing control systems

720
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,400
up that should make all of us pretty
nervous

721
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,990
so there's just a wide diversity a bill
level security that's out there I don't

722
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,839
know until you guys this you guys all
know it

723
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,140
you see a so what can we do about it

724
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,629
the executive order is our attempt to
raise the bar for cybersecurity the

725
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,740
what we're doing is we're asking those
companies and those individuals that

726
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,819
really do know a lot about cybersecurity
that

727
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,770
do practice it successfully everyday
share with us

728
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,480
the lessons you've learned nest the
National Institute of Standards and

729
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,210
Technology

730
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,570
a will work with you and

731
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,910
and write down the standards will take
the lessons you've learned put them into

732
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,250
what's called a framework

733
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,119
and we're going to use that encourage
companies to adopt that framework so

734
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,900
what's a framework

735
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,960
it's not

736
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,050
a new set standards we got a lot of
standards

737
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,250
me now there may be gaps and we may
discover that while we have a lot of

738
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,890
standards

739
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,500
we don't have sufficient standards on I
don't know dial-in access for control

740
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,119
systems

741
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,500
up but for the most part you guys use
the standards

742
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,720
you know about this 253 you know about
the ISO standards

743
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,080
if you're in the controls if you're in
the electric sector you deal with the

744
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,400
new york sip standards

745
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,650
and on and on and on right so we have
standards out there

746
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,089
so the framework is trying to do is is
one

747
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:42,140
put all those standards in a place
that's

748
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,970
useful accessible say look you want to
worry about access control

749
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:51,049
here's where you go to get information
about security access control to

750
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,260
put it out there the way this is like
these are the best lessons that people

751
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,710
on the leading edge have learned so this
is really from also standards these are

752
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,040
what people really recommend

753
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,750
you tackle in three structured in such a
way

754
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,540
you can articulated your leadership so
in some sense

755
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,550
a key outcome within this framework will
be

756
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,010
a presentation that helps you articulate
your CEO's if you're the CIO

757
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,950
the CISO help sure to get your CEO what
you need to do

758
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:26,290
and where you are in terms of
accomplishing that so okay we get this

759
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,230
great framework

760
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:32,180
in the framework by the way is due to
the first draft to come out in October

761
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,220
the final version will come out in
January now

762
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,848
well it's all still an idea people ask
me what you know how you saw this how

763
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,040
you solve an SEO the framers good take
care

764
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,380
I get the unicorn right so any problem
the world I'm like oh the framework will

765
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:45,960
solve that

766
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,000
%uh I'll be honest with you when it
comes out it's not in the unicorn

767
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,670
it's gonna be a pony all these things
take time

768
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,089
if you've been evolving standards
development you know that the first

769
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:58,170
draft never quite

770
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,800
catches a I expect that we'll be in that
place

771
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,640
to but I do think we'll have made a
significant contribution and will

772
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,420
iterated

773
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,580
ambers you too will be pretty good
version 3 will be really good

774
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,750
and hopefully we'll reach a point where
everybody just

775
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,190
remembers how great this thing is an
implicitly use it and this is

776
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,480
this is an ideal tool for them

777
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,230
so okay we get this framework

778
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,619
it's a very handsome pony

779
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,119
up what happens then and is really two
things

780
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,109
one is regulation

781
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:38,779
at parking but his ears up up

782
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,280
not really sorta so how do we do regular
what do we do with regulation here

783
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,099
so what we said is look some critical
infrastructures and regulated sectors

784
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:52,980
some portions the electric sector are
regulated Dido water supply

785
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,119
you name it what we said is look if
you're a regulator

786
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,420
for a sector that's already regulated we
ask you to take a look

787
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,710
your existing regulations your existing
standards and the status of your sector

788
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,390
and take a look at the framework and see
whether you need to take any actions

789
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,990
to update you do your regulations or any
other actions to help your sector more

790
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,759
secure itself because there's plenty of
actions that are less than

791
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,060
regulation um so we very clearly asked
regulators

792
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,349
take a look at this up there some
regulators that we can tell

793
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:30,550
do that and we tell them but most
regulators in the US are independent we

794
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,190
don't you tell them anything

795
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,480
I'm so we have invited them follow this
process they may choose to they may

796
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,480
choose not to

797
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,180
but again most at least much of our
critical infrastructure

798
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,160
is not regulated so what we gonna do
there

799
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,230
well one is we have a voluntary program
so we're

800
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,130
DHS's is starting right now to work the
private sector and say hey

801
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,900
what we construct is a program one
incentives can we offer you

802
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,300
to voluntarily adopt this framework

803
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,050
we're still working through that we
don't know the answers yet

804
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:06,119
but we're gonna try to make this an
attractive program essentially the

805
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,050
people want to sign up for

806
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,319
so that's Ste are working standards

807
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,859
the final portion the executive order is
the identification

808
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:19,098
critical infrastructure now

809
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,319
you may be thinking identification a
critical mistake we don't know what a

810
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,319
critical infrastructure is yet

811
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,170
a didn't we have all these efforts after
September 11th the figure out

812
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:33,660
what was our critical infrastructure the
answer to that is yes

813
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,069
but with greater unless and lesser
success so we did a very good job

814
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,170
identifying a pretty comprehensive list
over critical infrastructure with

815
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,560
respect to fiscal

816
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,900
rats so this thing matters

817
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,500
%uh and it could be taken down
physically

818
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,650
we don't less good job doing that with
respect to cyber threats

819
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:58,020
certainly in some sectors and moreover

820
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,619
we haven't always held the

821
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,690
we haven't always been his rigorous our
definition of curriculum structure

822
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,099
as I think we need to be and what I mean
by that is

823
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,609
some of our sets a critical
infrastructure pretty broad

824
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:15,920
and as you know if everything is a
priority nothing as a prior so what we

825
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,170
did

826
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,240
executive order we asked the Department
of Homeland Security

827
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,339
and sector agencies like the department
of energy to go out

828
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:25,970
take a look at critical infrastructure
and we put a pretty high bar

829
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,669
and we said what are those pieces of
infrastructure

830
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,760
where their loss with that are
vulnerable to cyber threats and where

831
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,720
their loss would cause a catastrophic
impact

832
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,089
on the US they have completed that
effort

833
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,230
ob and are in the process right now

834
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,890
notifying companies were on that list so
the good news is

835
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,920
is they did you are properly prioritize
approach so we're talking

836
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,940
tens or hundreds of companies not
hundreds or thousands

837
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,950
companies up and that's where we were in
the all

838
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,430
days as we were are the Socratic on
structure within thousands or tens of

839
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,009
thousands of companies

840
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,940
now not to tell you who's on it
obviously hello pinning a target

841
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,530
job but we are going out and starting
the process of notifying those companies

842
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,460
now why have we done that what's the
point

843
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,119
well a few things one is just so we
understand our national risk

844
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:23,560
you can't protect something if you don't
know what matters

845
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,819
and where your vulnerabilities are up
the other is to prioritize the

846
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:30,140
assistance the government has to offer

847
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,359
up we have all these programs to help
companies better secure themselves

848
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:37,359
if we know the companies that matter
most and the the infrastructure that

849
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,390
matters most

850
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,540
we can give those people first access to
those

851
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,569
programs and resources that the
government has to offer

852
00:47:46,569 --> 00:47:50,830
alright let me use my final topic
information-sharing

853
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,850
sorry service be legislation up

854
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:59,560
which one part is information check so

855
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,869
we're actually looking here here comes
another list

856
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:06,690
we're looking for five things from our
legislation

857
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,060
pressing Congress to help us with
information sharing

858
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,640
to incentivize the adoption at the
cybersecurity framework that framework

859
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,830
witnesses producing

860
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,910
to update our law enforcement
authorities so that things like

861
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:25,299
the racketeering laws can be used for
organized crime online

862
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:29,450
update DHS's authorities particularly
for how we secure the government so

863
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,100
that's a sort of internal housekeeping

864
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,180
and finally a national data breach
notification law

865
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,009
so up someone you may be aware the Nash
other data breach notification laws

866
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,650
that state 747 different states have
these laws

867
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,660
I think they're great idea they've done
a lot of good

868
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,440
up from a business perspective though
that's forty seven different loss to

869
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,530
comply with

870
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,330
up we think we need to one extent that
protection the remaining

871
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,509
citizens are the remaining three states
and to harmonize those laws

872
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,100
so there's a single national standard
rather than forty seven different state

873
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,839
standards

874
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,600
that's what we're looking for
legislation most people are interested

875
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,440
in the information sharing part of that

876
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,710
it is only one other parts of it up but
that seems to be was drawn the most

877
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,700
attention

878
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,089
so let me flag what we're trying to do
an information-sharing

879
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:24,230
I mention that the executive orders
about the government pushing information

880
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,220
out to the private sector we also need
the private sector to be able send

881
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,609
information and

882
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:33,920
so they can say hey a we had an
intrusion

883
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,040
this what for example here's the
signature %uh a rootkit we found in our

884
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,220
systems

885
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,020
or so the companies can talk to each
other hey we're getting a denial of

886
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,250
service attack from this IP address are
you suffering that as well

887
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,490
up or its your IP address what to do
something about it please

888
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,049
so some companies do that today other
companies

889
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:59,710
have general counsels and say look I
don't know this is entirely kosher

890
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,790
you know there's uncertainty in the law
and that makes me nervous

891
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,210
and I'm risk averse so what's what's the
monetary benefit to our company if

892
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,890
you're sharing information

893
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,460
no monetary benefit okay so I'm I'm a
general counsel I see

894
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,619
some uncertainty here which means risk
to me you can't quantify the benefits

895
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:17,390
and so the answer for me

896
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:22,368
regional councils easy no way don't
share that information

897
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:25,830
now like I said some companies are
successful here

898
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,869
but we need to be able to make it easier
for companies to share

899
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:32,230
and so that's what we're looking for in
cybersecurity legislation

900
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,390
now when you enter that space privacy is
a concern

901
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,250
company share information with each
other company share information with the

902
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,119
government

903
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,270
privacy is a very significant concern

904
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:48,359
up we've pushed the debate on that is
really focused in three areas:

905
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:53,450
and the government has pushed for strong
privacy perfect protections in all three

906
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,509
areas

907
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:58,359
the first the center minimization if
you're going to share information with

908
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:00,000
the government

909
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,450
you have to its on you to make sure that

910
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,368
there's no PIII no irrelevant
information in that

911
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:10,470
and what your share up

912
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,250
the second is use limitations on that
information you share information the

913
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,170
government the government

914
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,430
should only be able to use that
information or other companies

915
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,950
for cyber security purposes so

916
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,759
this can be shared in use for you know
whatever random purpose you thought if

917
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,450
you share with another company they
can't use it for marketing

918
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,618
I'm you share with the government we can
use it for other purposes

919
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,460
other than cybersecurity and the third
is that the government the information

920
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,670
to come into the government

921
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,799
through a civilian agency with a strong
oversight regime

922
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,509
so that's what we're pushing for with
respect to legislation

923
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,119
information-sharing incentivize Asian

924
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:53,730
avi adoption to the cybersecurity
framework to update our law enforcement

925
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,290
authorities

926
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:59,069
to update the authorities for how we
secure ourselves in the government

927
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:04,700
and national data breach notification
laws

928
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,730
so when he gets a question and answer
session so you guys can

929
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,770
hit me up with all those easy questions
you wrote down on that one piece a paper

930
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:15,940
up so let me close by asking for your
help

931
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,230
you in this room have enormous knowledge
that we need

932
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:24,030
please contribute to the development of
the cybersecurity framework

933
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,420
that nest is leading they're having a
workshop

934
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,830
the second week up September in Dallas
Texas

935
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,609
even if you can go to the workshop read
the documents they post online

936
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,580
email them your comments I promise you
those emails do not go into a black hole

937
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,500
somewhere they're reaching everyone

938
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,640
they often print them out and bring them
and leave them at me I'm so I know this

939
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,140
her and you can

940
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,000
you can specify in your email whether
you want your comment to be public or

941
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,510
not

942
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,560
so if you feel shy about comments in a
way that will be public

943
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,630
been just let them know that

944
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:03,410
that's a key thing you can do another
key thing you can do

945
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,670
is with respect information-sharing
there are companies and organizations

946
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:11,410
that are successfully sharing
information right now

947
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,200
there are lots of different venues for
doing this

948
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,129
our general term for them and the
government is information sharing and

949
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,220
Analysis organizations

950
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,299
some other more well-known once our
information sharing and analysis centers

951
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:27,810
ice axe but however you do it

952
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,369
share information about what you're
seeing on your system's how your

953
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:36,450
defeating the bad guys and help other
people learn as well

954
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:42,680
you identify roadblock for sharing
information let us know

955
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,940
so one of the things we're trying to do
is really tear carefully tailor

956
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,730
our legislative approach that we really
only solve the problem for people

957
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,569
experiencing

958
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:53,779
not for a broad solutions here so it
always helps us to have

959
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,220
concrete examples I've this information
we want to share

960
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,970
we cannot share it because our general
counsel says the following: thing as an

961
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:01,890
impediment

962
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,910
it's really helpful for us we made a lot
of progress

963
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,560
over the last year and over the last
decade I think all of us understand it

964
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,020
is not enough

965
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,349
but I think it's also work worth
recognizing the progress we've made

966
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:20,230
this issue is now on the radars have
CEO's senior government leaders in a way

967
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,580
that has never been

968
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,740
and ultimately that's how we're gonna
solve it not by a top-down

969
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,618
solution by everybody becoming aware of
the problem

970
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,880
everybody doing their part to solve

971
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,560
so thank you for your efforts myspace
thank you for doing your part

972
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,940
solve the problem and thank you for your
kind attention

973
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:46,940
this morning thanks he

974
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:56,790
and now be very happy to take your easy
question

975
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,790
blowout Chantal in Treasury Department
army

976
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,090
I believe this was a item three on your
list

977
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:10,300
international engagement which lists up

978
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:14,010
so you mentioned China and Russia about

979
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:19,480
what about international engagement with
allies and neutral countries

980
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,190
because we seem to be confusing the heck
out of them

981
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,750
right now on so yes we do that too

982
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,050
up you international engagement issue
right so

983
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,820
if you're if you've been paying
attention for example the World

984
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,740
Conference on

985
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,689
it. with you %uh vitu

986
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:41,820
conference it happened last winter I

987
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,580
that was a big push for the US
government I'm there are lots of

988
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,490
different venues

989
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:50,399
in which were engaging with countries
were helping people build their capacity

990
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,390
on even if it's just helping them better
develop national level certs

991
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,759
up were engaging with like-minded
countries to help develop

992
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,150
norms of behavior what is and is not
acceptable in cyberspace

993
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:07,060
%uh so we're absolutely deeply engaged
not just with people were worried about

994
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,920
but also with people who we can share

995
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,150
will alternate

996
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,340
here II I'm Joe as well I'm

997
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,020
alternate yeah

998
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,930
at and Joe I live in Denmark an American
um

999
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,930
in .1 you mentioned

1000
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,339
the introduction a voluntary standards

1001
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:34,190
for companies with regards to security
worry reflections

1002
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:39,050
as a x1 a bus on voluntary standards for
companies

1003
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,090
and their efficacy up

1004
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:48,840
so I think we're into a tough space

1005
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,050
I think there is no appetite

1006
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,590
for mandatory standards I think there's
the

1007
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:59,020
reasonable concern that certainly
top-down

1008
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,840
meant for standards being in other words
regulation right but there is a concern

1009
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,710
that a top-down approach regulation

1010
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:09,380
will be harmful rather we've tried to
thread the needle

1011
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:13,340
here right we've tried to say first
let's come up with the standard

1012
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,670
so the people understand what we're
talking about and we can figure out

1013
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,950
whether it's a useful step

1014
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,930
vent we ask existing regulators

1015
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:24,540
to take a look at it and see what
they're doing enough some of them

1016
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,850
may ultimately regulate because the
standard up we're asking them to

1017
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:33,830
to really do that analysis up but there
are also plenty of places in our

1018
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,799
critical infrastructure where there is
no regulator

1019
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,410
the administration's proposal from a
2011

1020
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,730
up did to congress did seek to address
it

1021
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:46,330
dick did seek to create the government
authority to regulate critical

1022
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,060
infrastructure

1023
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,570
in areas where it's not currently
regulate that didn't fly

1024
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:54,360
that was not gonna pass to Congress
failed to votes

1025
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,090
and so that's where we are were in the
space we're going to work with our

1026
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,120
existing authorities

1027
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,660
I and we actually think executive order
done a really good jobs for the

1028
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,549
threading the needle

1029
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:09,050
up moving the ball forward while
addressing the concerns about

1030
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:12,340
unhelpful regulation yes

1031
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,550
rich Johnson and car in Boulder Colorado

1032
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:18,640
I'm we work with a number of agencies

1033
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,220
that are subject to fizz meh so you're
mentioned continuous monitoring

1034
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,200
and Ernest process kinda gave me

1035
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,660
bad cold shivers time we do operational
security fairly effectively

1036
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,310
on we find we have to you tear down a
lot of that

1037
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:41,000
to fit in with FISMA requirements

1038
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,720
as and doing things in a less secure

1039
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,910
a safe manner on we don't do his
Marcel's because we don't have the

1040
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:50,879
manpower for

1041
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,090
producing a 600 a Bible every every
three to six months

1042
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:59,540
a person hours so I'm wondering if you
have any insight

1043
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,020
into you rationalizing that whole mass

1044
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,240
so that we can actually do security
monitoring

1045
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,330
not continuous monitoring controls that
might or might not actually Securus

1046
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:14,100
so for people who are in is involved in

1047
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,509
and sorta security on the government
side

1048
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,200
his means the federal Information
Security Management Act up

1049
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,620
and there are some problems both with
the act and with how the government has

1050
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,400
been further interpreted

1051
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,530
there are organizations and government
to work within the existing

1052
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,860
Bisma framework and do amazing security

1053
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,370
up they're also organizations and
government who have essentially

1054
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:42,470
devolved into a very compliance focused
approach

1055
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,700
who you security as the production
reports

1056
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,230
about no have been permitted access
control do they have physical security

1057
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,560
up this very much almost sorta

1058
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,090
safety checklist type approach rather
than

1059
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,050
do you have people who are looking at
anomalies on your network

1060
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:05,330
and responding to them itself so they're
absolutely problems some those problems

1061
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,549
with the law

1062
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:10,230
some those problems are with the
procedures that the executive branch has

1063
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,050
built

1064
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:14,080
upon the law and some others problems
our interpretation

1065
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,310
and we're working hard to solve all
three of those I mention 1045

1066
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,850
legislative priorities was to update

1067
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,190
the government's authorities with
respect to securing itself

1068
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:26,210
I was specifically referring to that
federal Information Security Management

1069
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:27,530
Act FISMA

1070
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,760
were absolutely trying to update it to
help us move away from these problems

1071
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,750
up the other thing we're doing
internally taking a look at our

1072
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,000
procedures to try and update them

1073
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,190
and then we have key agencies running
pilots

1074
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:44,470
about how we think the world should be
so that we can use those pilots

1075
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:48,520
to demonstrate whether or not our new
ideas worker don't work

1076
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,340
%uh and then more probably happen
adopted across the government so

1077
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,430
absolutely recognize those problems up

1078
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,230
also recognize that their government
agencies doing really well under this

1079
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,610
current contract

1080
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:03,120
but week we do think that we need to
change the construct make it easier for

1081
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,390
the government secure itself

1082
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,520
morning my cell signal from johnson
Johnson

1083
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,190
with respect to the idea of sharing

1084
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,450
classified signatures with certain
providers

1085
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,680
who could then offer protection to you
know small

1086
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:26,339
municipal agencies and whatnot or their
concerns about this being seen as an

1087
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:31,760
yeah anti-competitive move and creating
anti-trust issues and stuff

1088
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,570
up I don't I'm not aware such concerns

1089
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,360
that program was initially piloted on
the defense industrial base

1090
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,360
so it is up and running now on some
defense industrial base companies

1091
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,910
up the reason I don't think there are
such concerns

1092
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:50,980
is we have not limited the number of
service providers

1093
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,340
so anybody who's willing to to pay to be

1094
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,800
to have the class by facility have the
people with clearances

1095
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,210
on who can pass in fact the security
checks associate with that

1096
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:06,300
can become a service provider and we
want a diversity of service providers we

1097
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,430
don't want service providers just one
type

1098
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:12,770
I think ideally for us service provider
bundles as with other services

1099
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,910
I'm and really adds a lot of value their
customers

1100
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:19,240
so that's the service provider side the
customer side

1101
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,299
ones are critical infrastructure

1102
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,970
you can sign up and pay for this program
and and we don't dictate the cost at all

1103
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,750
right so ideally what service writers
would do some

1104
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:33,730
competition will have low-cost

1105
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,530
Obama such University of Penn Tony I am

1106
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:42,590
I have a question in the notebook I'm
not sure is the easy one all

1107
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:46,140
so air I was going to the or information
sharing

1108
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,420
so fun to look at the classical
intrusion by robbery

1109
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,480
packed policy a very detailed reports

1110
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,300
is available to the public not to the
other interested parties or the region a

1111
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:56,860
Boerse

1112
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,280
only so do you plan to make them your

1113
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,270
report of crime incidents in the
critical infrastructure available to the

1114
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,600
public because from what your own warts

1115
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,730
looks like you're not you just want you
not gonna value this

1116
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,660
critical problem for the defense of
thousands of companies because you may

1117
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,680
in fact that which is not like saying

1118
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,710
you know we're not gonna tell if there's
been a robbery because other office with

1119
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,230
cum

1120
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:22,890
but I usually make sense so you plan to
make available data to the public

1121
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:26,270
so we're good weren't difficult spot
right now where

1122
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:30,980
up most people I think it's safe to say
that most companies would suffer a

1123
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,300
significant reason

1124
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,970
do not report it up and so

1125
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:39,080
you can make a case that we'd all be
better off

1126
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,730
there was public reporting a all
intrusions

1127
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,160
up but I think the world that we live in
right now is up

1128
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,850
we have to incentivize reporting we have
to make it work people's time

1129
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:53,480
to report crimes and one that means we
have to show them that they report the

1130
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:53,980
crime

1131
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:58,100
there'll be a positive action as a
result but they're likely to have

1132
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,360
the intruder either caught or in some
other sense prosecuted

1133
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,400
to at the moment we have to assure them
that there won't be a downside

1134
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,050
reporting prime up and parked outside
right now is people are concerned

1135
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,720
about their reputation and they think if
they report a cyber intrusion

1136
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,950
that will have a significant negative
impact on their company

1137
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:23,100
up so you know further down the road
would be good

1138
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:28,380
have public reporting intrusions I can
see the sense in that

1139
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,120
had fully thought through so many maybe
I can also see some counter arguments

1140
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,109
but right now

1141
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:39,280
it's just not feasible

1142
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,120
William Alan Simpson bedroom

1143
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,529
re: I could probably give a talk as long
as yours

1144
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,000
about incidents that i've seen over the
years

1145
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,630
arm but I'm just gonna give a couple of
examples because I see the Miss

1146
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:58,670
what the government isn't doing I you
know

1147
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,780
are gay as an example for infrastructure

1148
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,740
I happened on an ISP which happened to
serve this artist damn

1149
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,169
mississippi and very

1150
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,210
I also happen no helped found a
different organization

1151
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:17,000
and must be sacked that are reports
incidents and sure enough both for their

1152
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,370
XP machines have been taken over

1153
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:25,640
while we end up having put a fire wall
in front of them because that Tennessee

1154
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,830
Valley Authority's

1155
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:30,910
the well no you don't have authority to
upgrade or do anything with those

1156
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,950
machines

1157
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:37,180
arm that's a government authority

1158
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,319
and am and we see this in hospitals as
well we see

1159
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:45,510
vats I am equipment I've had the to
actually isolates

1160
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:49,600
sweets within a hospital because it's
gotta be able to talk to the front table

1161
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,319
but the machines are infected the Maersk
sending stuff out that

1162
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,710
you know potential room fact everything
else in the hospital and all the people

1163
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,470
come by on their wifi or visitors right
which is

1164
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,980
maybe howard got in the first place
because they're not so you're gonna

1165
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,430
networks and blow up

1166
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:08,149
arm but again

1167
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:11,480
they can't up to it date vere

1168
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,680
medical equipment because their
regulatory processes that keep them from

1169
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,980
doing so

1170
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,150
it needs to be turned on its head and
these two be

1171
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:24,300
if you don't updates from we will come
up

1172
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:28,670
down on you are your the accord original
equipment manufacturer

1173
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:32,300
you made your money by selling the
equipment but it was faulty

1174
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,400
it use Windows some under cliffhanger
which means you have to come up with

1175
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,380
regular updates

1176
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,670
or you lose your certification or we
find you

1177
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:44,700
and I don't see any need for additional
loss to do this this is an enforcement

1178
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,569
issue

1179
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:49,220
we you know we can stop thinking these
companies as job creators

1180
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:53,549
because if they are moving the
liabilities of under the public

1181
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,630
and on for the ISP's van there

1182
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,500
they're not creating jobs are sucking
money out of our pockets

1183
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:05,320
so we need are we have a tremendous
legacy problem with

1184
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,970
arm are orphaned software right

1185
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:11,970
modems that are on major cable modem

1186
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:15,980
providers that I can be used for denial
of service attacks

1187
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,780
due to not filtering external DNS

1188
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:23,450
again this is an enforcement issue I'm
and I have not seen

1189
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,970
any increase in the budgets the Ca Mau
the above Obama administration on the

1190
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,259
enforcement Federal Trade Commission
answer a

1191
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,850
be these budgets got a CBI quintupled in
triple

1192
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:38,680
II v are we're not see anywhere near
enough

1193
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,200
re-arm in crease in funding for the
researchers

1194
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,960
you may not have the internal personnel
in there may be no incentive for the

1195
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,870
private companies to go and do the

1196
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:53,299
research involving abilities but
certainly we have got if we want more

1197
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,310
people to go into this field we have to
have more people who wanna go in the

1198
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,250
graduate work in order to do that

1199
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:01,920
we have to fund the research which means
we need a

1200
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,380
100 times more funding and I don't see
the funding is a priority coming out at

1201
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:07,800
all

1202
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,860
the Obama administration and bothers me
a great deal the person who took five

1203
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,890
months of

1204
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:16,970
in 2008 and became the Midwest Regional
Coordinator for

1205
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:21,850
all of his network's arm Vicky

1206
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:25,299
other thing that really bugs me about
your much I mean other than the

1207
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:26,899
classification stuff is

1208
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:29,950
I didn't hear anything about what you're
doing to help protect

1209
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:35,149
us against the other half from the cyber
security folks

1210
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:39,290
the Alexanders love the world who are
invading us

1211
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,759
and in you know your privacy office what
is your privacy office doing

1212
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,290
to assist me in over this offer
providers them

1213
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,479
and the consumers against and protect us

1214
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,580
against this other branch of government
which turns out to be

1215
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:58,700
our own worst enemy what are you doing
to help us

1216
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,080
okay so heard a lotta questions in there

1217
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,490
let me let me try to go through those in
order in get them all

1218
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:13,330
so I think first there was a an
overarching recognition that

1219
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:16,759
the government is not perfect and I
cannot agree more with that

1220
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:20,370
so that's one a it with respect to our
own security

1221
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:23,858
our own processes and that's absolutely
true

1222
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:27,540
up and that's one reason why we want to
have for example

1223
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,259
business process relying upon the
private sector leadership

1224
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:34,569
is I know maybe

1225
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:37,910
maybe there's some in this room knows
all the answers it's not me

1226
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:41,620
and so we think that together we have a
better chance of coming up with good

1227
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,210
answers

1228
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:46,380
we do separately then you you expressed
a concern that I think

1229
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:50,279
is a real concern real frustration for
me with respect to things like

1230
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:53,990
ob control systems and medical devices

1231
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:57,599
both of those are areas where there has
been a strong

1232
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,410
culture of safety for a very long time
safety and reliability and I think

1233
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,120
that's great

1234
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,340
I mean obviously we need that up that
culture of safety reliability

1235
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:09,620
often clashes with the culture of
security

1236
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:14,920
a because in the specific instances the
culture of safety reliability is

1237
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:19,080
you do not modify the software on the
system

1238
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:23,260
you know updated you don't change it or
if you update you do it after extremely

1239
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,160
link the

1240
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:28,370
process love testing and revalidation

1241
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:31,660
um that it's gonna do what you think is
going to do up

1242
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:35,190
that's a real problem particularly when
these devices then start running

1243
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:39,480
essentially commodity operating systems
in commodity off-the-shelf hardware

1244
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,769
other software so we don't have the
solution to that problem yet

1245
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:47,000
up I think if you look at the medical
devices space

1246
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,510
and this is this is me hypothesizing I
don't know that on this

1247
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:55,120
up you know i i wonder if

1248
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,540
regular updates the software would
actually cause more loss of life

1249
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:03,610
then quarantining infected computers I
don't know the answer to that

1250
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:07,380
up but that's a kinda question that that
the FDA has to take into account

1251
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,120
when they when they look at this stuff
but clearly where we are

1252
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:16,070
is not a good spot and I'm not confident
that the trends are good trends

1253
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:19,630
neither those spaces so that's
absolutely something we need to do a

1254
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,220
better job

1255
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,420
and that matters both for the government
in terms of

1256
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,140
how we certify things what our
requirements are for updates

1257
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,350
it also matters to the private sector in
terms of what you choose

1258
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:36,300
for the software when you build a device
and system

1259
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:41,200
so if you're in any those areas I would
ask you for your help as well

1260
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,910
up next question was about funding up

1261
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:48,070
I don't know specifically about funding
for

1262
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:52,889
a all the areas that you mention I will
tell you that we have

1263
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:57,000
significantly increased well I guess is
two aspects that

1264
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,150
one is is we haven't had a budget passed
in years

1265
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,290
up so nothing his

1266
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:06,700
you know there has been no sort of
update or modification for years

1267
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,420
but I was just referring that both the
budget that you submit I understand that

1268
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,910
there is a recalcitrant

1269
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:16,090
Howard really congress but the budget
your summit

1270
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,900
kinda says where are really D so we have
actually

1271
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:23,929
since the beginning administration up

1272
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:27,390
I don't know this for sure but my belief
is that we have significantly actually

1273
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:29,280
increase server security funding

1274
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,540
and I'll go back and check on that but
that's my understanding

1275
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,180
up we have undoubtedly not increase
funding in all the areas you mention I'm

1276
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,720
I'm sure but we have been putting a lot
of money into cyber security

1277
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,320
now one of the tricks is actually up it
turns out government always had doesn't

1278
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:45,960
have always

1279
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,530
a good way of tracking what we're
finding in terms of

1280
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:54,200
at the government-wide level how do we
make sure that we can count

1281
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,130
what everybody is spinning on
cybersecurity we haven't really had a

1282
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,600
mechanism for doing that

1283
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,700
we just introduce such a mechanism last
year

1284
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,059
up in last year's budget submission
rather up

1285
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:09,520
switched government budget being
complicate is actually the budget for

1286
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,740
the upcoming for fiscal year up so it

1287
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,219
we really for the first time introduces
taxonomy love

1288
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:20,400
I'm all essentially tagging so every
agency needs to tag

1289
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,099
items in its budget that are related to
cybersecurity so that we can then

1290
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,340
have a sense love how much are we
spending where's it going

1291
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,970
and have a better way of controlling are
we putting our resources in the right

1292
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,000
place

1293
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,810
we started that last year wasn't perfect

1294
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:39,140
I but it was a good first step forward
we're gonna refine it

1295
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,850
this year the next few years until we
have a really sensible taxonomy

1296
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:46,580
you have to balance of course up getting
people to do that information with

1297
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,890
with making it so onerous that it
becomes excruciating took out

1298
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:54,020
you know everybody who's ever you know
patched a single system

1299
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:58,150
so that was the third item

1300
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:01,809
the fourth I don't I think is with
respect to the

1301
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:06,090
the recent from our perspective on of
rise disclosures

1302
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:09,740
and the real sense of concern I think
people have about

1303
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,300
what their reading in the newspapers up
that's not

1304
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:18,010
a conversation that you know frankly I
can do a good job having here

1305
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:21,330
it's not the area I focus on

1306
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:25,370
aunt you know honestly if I were able to
talk about I would have done was

1307
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:29,210
read some very strict talking points and
now we've been boring for you

1308
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:32,420
we've been boring for me and not that
productive so

1309
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,940
up I will only say that you know i i
understand your concern

1310
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:41,280
I will tell you that you know we are
very conscious

1311
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,450
that cybersecurity and privacy are very
closely coupled

1312
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:50,019
both for the sort of traditional reasons
love

1313
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,800
everything the subcommittee world is
like we can have privacy unless you have

1314
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,870
cyber security

1315
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:58,050
most people the privacy world find that
really infuriating statement

1316
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:01,350
because they feel like it essentially
misses the broader point

1317
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:04,890
about their concerns about privacy in
who

1318
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:09,280
from who is from whom is your privacy
protected up

1319
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,019
but there's that traditional approach
there's also the realization that

1320
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,450
up if people don't trust their
government

1321
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:21,670
a then the government won't be able to
contribute cyber security people will

1322
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:24,290
call it said when they detect intrusion

1323
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:27,330
we won't be able to have programs for
which share information and help other

1324
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,540
people out

1325
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:31,580
so absolutely understand that

1326
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,870
both from a personal perspective
somebody who just values

1327
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:38,730
my privacy um but also from a strategic
perspective that this is critical for

1328
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,209
the government

1329
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,180
I am sure they will from Tel Aviv
University I want to bring you back to

1330
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,330
the question no

1331
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,570
regulation that you answered my
questions on before

1332
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,370
on the critical infrastructure areas so
I understand

1333
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:57,950
your statement that you tried to put in
regulation

1334
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:02,030
a the quest the legislation and that
didn't fly so you have political issues

1335
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:04,360
that prevent you from doing what you
want

1336
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,490
a so how do you envision

1337
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:10,700
incentivizing all those or organizations

1338
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:15,849
to actually do something because you're
really asking the private sector to

1339
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:17,460
invest money

1340
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:21,469
your receipt the CEO some company and
the

1341
01:16:21,469 --> 01:16:25,850
you know that your or you could know
that your organization is insecure

1342
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:28,930
and the you're vulnerable to lots of
things

1343
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:32,410
and you can do better by investing money
in it

1344
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:36,490
there's no upside to that investment
with the return on the investment

1345
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,800
so if you regulate okay you have to
regular

1346
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,610
you saying that your current political
structure does not allow you to put

1347
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:46,630
regulation into the station so how

1348
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,610
else would you motivate CEOs to do
anything

1349
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:54,589
you can maybe a away insurance

1350
01:16:54,590 --> 01:17:00,130
rates a from if you look at what
happened the credit card industry

1351
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,770
the only way that the the credit card
inches

1352
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:07,680
the three got better was because
unilaterally

1353
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:12,710
a visa and American Express and a a
MasterCard got together and

1354
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:16,810
decided to wield the big stick and say
okay we're not gonna process your

1355
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:20,060
your transactions if you don't meet PCI

1356
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,950
and that and so everybody took notice
arm

1357
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,150
if you look at what's happening in the
in the energy if you look at

1358
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:32,040
networks if there's quite a bit of
pushback from the regulated

1359
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,810
a organizations that they don't want to

1360
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:40,270
go to Newark version 5 because it's too
expensive to for them and that's

1361
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:40,930
regulated

1362
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:44,260
what about the people that aren't
regulated are they gonna be for

1363
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,950
incentivized to do anything

1364
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,330
okay up so one thing I want to be clear
about

1365
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,600
is what we originally proposed an army
2011

1366
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,370
legislative proposal was not regulations
but the authority to regulate

1367
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,890
so since I V authority to regulate
currently unregulated critical

1368
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:04,130
infrastructure

1369
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:08,280
up I actually think our our solution the
executive order is a really good

1370
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,309
solution

1371
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,810
up quite possibly better than our
original solution

1372
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:16,760
and that is what let's come up with what
we think the standard is together

1373
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,280
job and then encourage people to adopt
it

1374
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,200
have the existing regulators take a look
at it up that will leave gaps

1375
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,570
right there there will be unregulated
areas where people

1376
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,059
do not adopt the cybersecurity framework
and we'll have to take another look at

1377
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,620
the situation that

1378
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:37,910
now what are we gonna do in the meantime
center by the adoption in the framework

1379
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:40,990
we actually the cybersecurity
coordinator Michael Daniel

1380
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:44,660
released a blog post on this literally a
week ago

1381
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:48,469
months if you want a Google Michael
Daniel cybersecurity

1382
01:18:48,469 --> 01:18:52,570
incentives I you'll find your way to it
I won't be

1383
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:56,420
for sheep you can kinda by the way and I

1384
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:00,180
so let me mention a few things that
we're talking about as a result

1385
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,680
above you know the executive order
actually task three agencies

1386
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,430
to do a study on sedatives and come back
to us with their outcomes

1387
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,650
and when they come back to and we gave
them very little time to do this cuz

1388
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:15,190
course hurry up %uh to be that report
three weeks ago

1389
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:17,950
and so they came back to us with their
reports and that's what this blog post

1390
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,010
talking about a week so the reports and
says

1391
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:23,530
we got these reports a look at the whole
universe have incentives

1392
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:26,660
and narrow them down to nine areas where
they think it makes sense to

1393
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,540
to focus our efforts not can't remember
all nine of the top my head but let me

1394
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,980
hit up a few of them

1395
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:36,000
up one of them is in fact the insurance
industry how do we work the insurance

1396
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,190
industry to make

1397
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,299
the framework more useful for them arm

1398
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,230
and and more the mechanism that they
could use in setting for example

1399
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,980
premiums

1400
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,169
another one is rate recovery so

1401
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:53,710
if you're regulated utility you have
this big new expense for cybersecurity

1402
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,690
you may not actually be you know but you
can change your prices so big

1403
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:01,089
expense no change in prices I'm

1404
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:04,480
I think you can guess how that usually
plays out up

1405
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,589
so one of the things that we're looking
at is encouraging

1406
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:14,130
those regulators who have a role in
setting rates is to accept essentially

1407
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:18,670
win when regulated utilities come to you
with the case for race increase

1408
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:22,210
because they need to invest more in
cybersecurity to look at that

1409
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:25,240
Bob with open mind

1410
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,620
another area we're looking at is
prioritizing government grants

1411
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,890
and our technical assistance so

1412
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:36,250
if you're for example if you worked as
patient in the voluntary program

1413
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,870
adopted the cybersecurity framework one
it's enough we could offer

1414
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:43,099
is to either prioritize he was a
potential recipient of a government

1415
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:43,910
grant

1416
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:47,830
or for this the the sort of technical
assist in the programs that we offer

1417
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:52,340
I you could have sort of priority access
to those programs

1418
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,710
up in a goes on there sort of nine areas
that are discussed their summer those

1419
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,490
are areas that we can move out right now

1420
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:00,410
and we're moving out on them others
though those areas are things that say

1421
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,090
hey this is something we could do

1422
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:05,550
but first we actually have to have the
framework developed so we could

1423
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:09,180
craft a good program around us so some
areas we're gonna have to wait until the

1424
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,460
framework is already out

1425
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,920
and then we can see how we can move
forward but it's a tough problem I i

1426
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,300
certainly agree

1427
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:21,800
lose rameriz for college you spoke amado

1428
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,400
solving the problem with the steps to
homes I would be but could you be more

1429
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,570
specific on what metrics are using

1430
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:32,650
and when you would consider the problem
solved

1431
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:37,250
home man brutal

1432
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,670
home how many have you

1433
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:46,710
who work in several security feel like
you have good metrics

1434
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,410
you'd raise your hand I was gonna
totally like tackle you after this

1435
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:52,410
conversation and be like to be about
your veterans

1436
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,920
up metrics is tough and cybersecurity
it's tough for the

1437
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,860
a tactical level you know where it's
just about securing my metric my network

1438
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,480
in my doing a good job at that

1439
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,860
its it's tough at the the broader
operational level and it's super tough

1440
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,150
at the strategic level

1441
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:10,150
up I don't have a great answer for you
on that %uh

1442
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:14,299
right now that the bad news is right now
the problem is so

1443
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:17,870
obviously terrible up that

1444
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:21,490
you know we'll hook we know it's a
problem

1445
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,679
I think as we get to the point where
we're really worried about how we solve

1446
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,160
the ninety percent are 100 percent

1447
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,690
I will happily deal with metrics on that
day that will be a problem I we love to

1448
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:33,559
have

1449
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,060
is bureaucratic I in the area of privacy
and security

1450
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,469
I was wondering if there's legislation
addressed

1451
01:22:41,469 --> 01:22:46,160
thinking and along these lines in terms
of defining property

1452
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:50,190
their IDs is my life the picture of my
face my property almighty

1453
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:53,940
genome or obviously there's clear laws
for

1454
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,040
my house that I own in terms of what's
my property

1455
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:01,510
but assured I bite is almost nothing but
just wondering in the area have

1456
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:05,840
serve digital information what is my
name

1457
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,890
what he shared with his not mind and can
be public

1458
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:13,330
because I think that's where government
really needs to define if some company

1459
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:15,610
does something with something that

1460
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:22,160
all law would define as mine without my
approval or without paying me for it

1461
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:26,440
on i was just wondering is there any you
serve areas that people are thinking or

1462
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,830
academics looking at that thank you yet

1463
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:35,320
that's a really interesting question and
I think that's one

1464
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,730
its okay do you say that are you propose
a government could define that

1465
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:43,120
I think I would actually say that we as
a society have to define

1466
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,809
what our thoughts in that space are ob
and that it could potentially be a role

1467
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,850
for the government

1468
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:51,630
to essentially record that consensus but
I don't think that

1469
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:55,850
that we as a society really decided what
we want

1470
01:23:55,850 --> 01:24:00,520
job certainly in the sort of commercial
sphere with respect to

1471
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,280
our data and the things that we we get
from sharing our debt

1472
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:09,200
um I would point you to the Commerce
Department released what's called a

1473
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,230
green paper

1474
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:14,480
on commercial Internet privacy and then
there was a successor white house

1475
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,160
document

1476
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,920
about it was December 20

1477
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,890
December 2012 I would point you take a
look at that

1478
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:27,750
so to see will riffing king but that is
a really tough problem

1479
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:31,460
and you know I expect all the viewers if
you're it working in a a product

1480
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:36,070
or services company are doing with that
problem as well

1481
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:39,420
so I don't have an answer right sir

1482
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,750
mister church a mix of research I have
the most probably remedial question

1483
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,610
I active very beginning if you talk you
briefly explained that

1484
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:51,929
the office urine is divided into
national a cyber security and homeland

1485
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:52,969
security

1486
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:57,940
and I the event diagram between national
and homeland is always been very hard

1487
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,950
for me to figure out

1488
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:03,070
for for physical stuff I kinda
understand that homeland means like what

1489
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,799
was line for some international

1490
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,000
its kinda what was intelligence but that

1491
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,500
division doesn't seem so clear to me
when it comes to information secure

1492
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,840
saber can you

1493
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,170
clarify that a bit more for us yeah

1494
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:19,580
that's a a really good point in I'll be
honest with you it's it's a little bit

1495
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,440
have a division of convenience in our
office

1496
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,509
it's it's based more upon the sort of
skill set

1497
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:28,610
that I have been at the the other
individual or office who

1498
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:32,019
focuses on national security have more
than anything else but

1499
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:35,600
but sorta roughly so for small the
answer is going to be

1500
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,210
um more practical answer than a
theoretically your answer

1501
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:42,990
so that the practical way that we divide
that is things like

1502
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:46,849
anything involving critical
infrastructure

1503
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,170
involving securing the government
essentially the security of a network

1504
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,960
based in the US

1505
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,920
is is in my realm he deals with issues

1506
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,510
%uh like diplomacy up military

1507
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:03,180
know what constitutes an active war in
cyberspace

1508
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:06,719
intelligence et cetera so that's really
on

1509
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,930
the other gentleman side but there's not
a great answer that I think it is quite

1510
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:13,390
bored in cyberspace

1511
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:16,790
hi the second question I had was

1512
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:20,050
on matters international engagement I'm
wondering how much is that

1513
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:24,850
is meant to actually help implications
on the public

1514
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:28,320
and so many people in this audience
spend so much time

1515
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,559
combating span explaining to Grandma's
about Nigerian scams

1516
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,340
military scams you know service

1517
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,700
et cetera which is coming from external
agents

1518
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,740
and yet of course we have to deal with
it

1519
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,380
as both as professionals and as society

1520
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:51,270
someone what can be done from your
office is because it forces outside the

1521
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:52,690
remit the FTC

1522
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:56,700
like up so it before before you sit down

1523
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,510
this is the second question about that
both times I've really try to figure out

1524
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,150
what the

1525
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:03,320
the text in your shirt says erase the
bad superstars

1526
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,389
it says go away or I will replace you
with a very small shell script

1527
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,490
max I

1528
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,540
not directed at you II visited I

1529
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:17,410
unless I would have asked a very
different question

1530
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:21,200
I dubbed I with curiosity second chance
I had that

1531
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,440
okay I up

1532
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:30,519
so you know how much of our efforts you
i think what you're getting at is really

1533
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,540
I it almost II

1534
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:37,250
I think what I'm hearing is how much or
are we focus on for example education

1535
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,780
and helping people really understand a

1536
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:44,259
what the security threats they face are
up

1537
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,150
how to reach out to other nations at a
tactical level and say

1538
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:51,679
%uh hey you know you have this open

1539
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:56,360
email relay on your network in whatever
different nation how do we

1540
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,440
really effectively bridge Bob what's
happening the US so that we can notify

1541
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,549
you and ask you to take action

1542
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:05,800
on on the education side

1543
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,410
we have a program called well we have
National Cyber Security Awareness Month

1544
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:13,550
I'm sure it's blocked off in your
calendars walked off my mind

1545
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:17,719
job and we have a program called

1546
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:20,800
the national initiative for
cybersecurity education now a lot of

1547
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,490
that is focused on things like
universities

1548
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:26,790
and university education or cyber
security challenges something that is

1549
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:28,100
focused on national level

1550
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,410
awareness-raising I think we've done a
good job

1551
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:35,080
I love having a sorta broad awareness
raising thing

1552
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:38,090
I don't know that we've really cracked
the problem love

1553
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:41,230
how do we offer really useful

1554
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:44,370
advice you know how do we offered by its
that the

1555
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:48,080
average person who doesn't pay attention
to this stuff can use to more

1556
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,019
effectively

1557
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:52,410
secure themselves and be aware threats
on the Internet I don't know that we've

1558
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,460
really cracked the code on

1559
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:57,830
that's something we're struggling with

1560
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,969
looks at a time what's going to speaker
again

1561
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:01,219
thank you
