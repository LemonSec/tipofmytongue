1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,459
one called morning in January love 2011

2
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:19,000
I put on my best suit and I walked into
a big

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,230
white government building for love
lawyers

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,330
now this is the Federal Trade Commission
building just down the street on

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,509
pennsylvania avenue

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,609
now many view I know would run screaming
from

7
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,600
a big white building for the government
lawyers many of you I'm sure would

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,379
prefer to walk into a shock nato

9
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:40,440
which is just a scary but at least has a
more reasonable dress code nevertheless

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,519
I did I went to this place on most every
work day for about a year and a half

11
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:49,900
as um as um are friend Steve el Avion

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,640
did for I has done for about a year
after me

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,890
I want to talk today about what it was
like

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,190
about what I learned their about how to

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,670
be a technologist working with people in
governments what it's like to work with

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,890
I buildings for love lawyers I and i
wanna talk especially about what we as a

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,450
community can do

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,159
and you need to do in order to interact
more effectively

19
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,380
with on with the people who make
decisions that affect not only us

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,960
but also the user's evolve our
technologies now

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,059
the first thing to talk about indeed may
be the only thing to talk about

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,270
in discussing how to work what it was
like to work in this area and what it's

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,359
like to work with policy people

24
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,038
is the differences in culture I really
felt in many respects like I was

25
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,140
crossing a border

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,880
when I went between Washington and back
home

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,789
to princeton every week there are big
differences

28
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:50,229
in on in the way people behave in the
way people think

29
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm and I'm a spending budget I'm
talking about that I learned

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,009
in going back and forth how to you how
to pass

31
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,590
in either community how to adopt let's
say the motive dresses up by Washington

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,240
people

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,960
or when coming out to meet folks like
you

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,049
how to adopt the motive dress love

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,550
well love the technical community

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,050
thank you very much alright

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,900
now that I'm appropriately dressed for
this audience

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,910
let me talk about this very real a gap
in

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,560
um on in culture and behavior I'm

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,930
it's no secret that there's a certain
amount of suspicion across this boundary

41
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,740
between

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,430
technologists and policy people are you
all remember our friend

43
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,720
Senator Ted Stevens and his a famous on

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,740
statement about the internet is
something that

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,530
of something stop truck its services
jobs

46
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,710
okay so we had our fun with this right
we made our

47
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm we labels are tubes as Internet even
Jon Stewart had fun with this one

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm although if you think about it what
senator Stevens said in that quote is

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,660
not so ridiculous

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,880
we talk all the time about the internet
or networks in terms of pipes we say

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,109
act have you filled the pipe how long is
the pipe on

52
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,880
we need a bigger pipe and so on pipe
tubes not so different

53
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,660
nonetheless %uh this became such a huge
me many became something that we still

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,370
remember laugh about now

55
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,710
because it tended to confirm the
stereotype we had

56
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,640
that people in in the policy world in
politics just don't get it when it comes

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,940
to the Internet I

58
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,310
now of course they don't always have the
highest opinion a bus

59
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,500
on in the view love I think too many
people inside the beltway

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,610
the typical technologist is like this
guy

61
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,560
on some a loser sitting in his and it
will always be his

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,020
in that at least in that stereotype up a
parent's basement

63
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,950
clicking away on a smoke stain IBM XT
keyboard

64
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,459
I'm indeed just I think last week here's
michael hayden the

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,570
recent a director the NSA talking about
a bunch of 20-somethings who haven't

66
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,920
talked to the opposite sex in five or
six years

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,500
so we don't have the best reputation in
the policy world

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,670
either now the good news at least

69
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,089
I'm I'll slightly good news for us is
that's open and pepper happened

70
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,870
that there was this big sorta uprising
that people in washington noticed

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,340
arm that at least suggested in the minds
of many people in the political world

72
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,770
that there was something important going
on in this technology world that maybe

73
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,030
these technology people

74
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,539
actually have voters and public opinion
on

75
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,900
on their side in some respects and so
people

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,080
in the political world at least believe
I think that they need to pay attention

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,889
to us

78
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,199
and that gives us an opportunity
nonetheless we still have this rather

79
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,699
awkward problem

80
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,310
of how to actually meet and work with
these people who are very different from

81
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,360
us

82
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,930
I love this picture so much because it
looks photoshopped

83
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,530
um but actually it's not um

84
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,489
elvis and nixon really did look that
different elvis did does just pop out at

85
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,349
this image in a way that nixon doesn't

86
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,219
but this is more or less what happens

87
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,949
some I think too often when we go to
meet and talk with people

88
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,259
into up policy world so I wanna talk
about how to be Elvis

89
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,779
and and work with nixon on a little bit

90
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,949
so first let me take a quick detour and
talk about

91
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,620
my job in what I did because one of the
things I learned early on

92
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,830
in dealing with government is that it's
a big mistake to think love

93
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,900
the government as a single monolithic
entity that has one opinion and one goal

94
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,810
and one strategy government consists of
a whole bunch of different

95
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,960
offices are agencies and

96
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,779
on and entities which are often at
cross-purposes an often for good reasons

97
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,599
so let me talk about my agency the FTC
the FTC has

98
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:55,240
has two main missions the first mission
is consumer protection

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,249
that means protecting consumers against
unfair or deceptive acts or practices

100
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:03,409
in commerce so if somebody is ripping
somebody of

101
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,270
on the Internet it's the FTC's job to do
something about it

102
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,438
that's a big job actually somebody's
ripping people off

103
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,159
of the internet it's also the FTC's job
to do something about that although I

104
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,300
didn't work and those cases as much

105
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,020
the second thing the FTC does is on it
shares with the Department of Justice

106
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,698
the anti-trust our competition

107
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:26,389
on mission in the US government and if
you think about it that's also a form of

108
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,059
consumer protection the whole purpose

109
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:31,210
of antitrust law is to maintain
competition

110
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,330
because competition is the best
guarantee that consumers will

111
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,109
will have a fair deal offered to them so
that's the FTC's mission is primarily a

112
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,319
civil law enforcement agency

113
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,509
didn't bring criminal cases against
people but most have what the agency

114
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,139
people do on most days

115
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,699
involves investigating a filing and on

116
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,309
carrying out civil law enforcement
actions my job as the chief technologist

117
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:58,509
at the FTC basically involves three
sorts of things

118
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,330
first I was a policy adviser to the
Chairman who's the head of the agency

119
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,969
during my time there the champ chairman
was Jon Leibowitz arm

120
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,650
that means that if the chairman was
having a meeting with some important

121
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,849
person if he was discussing some
important decision related to technology

122
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,248
I was there in the room he was the boss
he made the decisions

123
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,860
but I was at least part of the
conversation and hopefully giving him

124
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,689
good and helpful advice

125
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,930
number two I was an internal Technology
Consultant within the agency

126
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,569
that many anyone in the agency had some
technology issue

127
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,150
that went beyond their local expertise
they could come to me for help

128
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,210
sometimes I would just answer a question
yes the thing that company is saying to

129
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,620
you does make sense no it doesn't make
sense

130
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,650
or just go call this person but
sometimes I would

131
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,979
dive rather deeply into you a serious
technical issue for example

132
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,068
when I was at the FTC the agency did a
big I'm

133
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,729
antitrust investigation related to
Google search and so I spent a whole

134
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,599
bunch of time digging into the details
of how modern search technology works

135
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,639
and the evidence about Google's behavior
in choices and so on

136
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,039
and that factored into the decision that
the agency ultimately made

137
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,539
on 3rd I was an ambassador to the tech
community that means coming and talking

138
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,110
to groups like this

139
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,050
on it means talking to people in the
tech industry talking to tech companies

140
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,389
and generally promoting the flow of
information and understanding

141
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,379
between the FTC the big white building
for love lawyers and the tech community

142
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,309
two things I didn't do it was glad not
to do were first management

143
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:29,050
I had nobody reporting to me and no
budget for the first time in a long time

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,020
and it was actually really nice

145
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,689
on and second I didn't have any
infrastructure if the network went down

146
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:40,000
it wasn't my phone the train so my job
if you look at all three of these items

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,950
all three of them are really about

148
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,220
this working with the

149
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,449
working with someone who comes from a
different world then than you do

150
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,008
so let me talk intake in more detail
into how to do that

151
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,990
we often have an idealized a view of
what it means what it's like for

152
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,620
an expert and a policymaker to interact
so here's an expert in a policymaker

153
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,269
and in our on oversimplified optimistic
model

154
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,190
the pol the expert has access to truth

155
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,880
on and there some kind of communication
protocol operates between these two

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,220
with the idea being that the truth gets
conveyed to the policy makers so that

157
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,370
they can make good decisions

158
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,720
and we all wish it worked this way but
it often doesn't

159
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,060
on you see very often something like
this on

160
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,300
someone who assertive wears the mask
given expired

161
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,599
who comes in and throws up a big cloud
jargon and says trust me

162
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,970
this is the way it has to be and and
policymakers

163
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,240
often are in that situation and we find
this people

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,180
from our community especially people who
come out of science or come out of

165
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,959
on Applied Technology find this deeply
aggravating

166
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,479
and the reason we find this so
aggravating it difficult to deal with

167
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,779
is that it reflects a fundamental truth
that we don't want to deal with

168
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,500
and that is this the politics is not a
search for truth

169
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,750
in our world we at least pretend or on
our good days

170
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,750
actually achieve the the a the

171
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,570
the goal of having our discourse be a
search for truth people

172
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,170
stand-up at this conference and they
give papers people stand around a

173
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,130
whiteboard with pens a nice try to solve
a problem

174
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,339
and where at least got were at least
pretending we at least

175
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,649
are obliged to pretend that we're trying
to agree

176
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:28,209
on truth and trying to learn from each
other that's not what politics is for

177
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,550
politics is not like the West Wing we
don't I'm have

178
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,040
sophisticated I citation Lehtonen

179
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,790
discussions about great issues of state
law striding briskly down hallways

180
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,959
most the time we are dealing with bogus
things that people saying

181
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,069
on so here's a bogus a thing that I
heard a lot

182
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:51,910
something is not technologically
possible are now sometimes when people

183
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,589
said this they were right

184
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:56,319
I'm sometimes they made the opposite
thing I've saying oh yeah we can do that

185
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,199
easily when

186
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,500
that involves solving the halting
problem on

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,560
but not technologically possible
something that we heard a lot and

188
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,959
I'm I thought a lot about how to debunk
it the best way to debunk it is to send

189
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,719
them back the code for doing it

190
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
here's some code I wrote to say that no
actually you can do that is an online

191
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,319
program I wrote in

192
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:17,779
in 10 minutes I'm you also see a level
of the rhetoric that

193
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,009
is not that that high level that we see
from almost everyone in this community

194
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,630
I'm this guy for example wrote in one
blog post the following

195
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,380
in salty talked about mob rule called
someone a bolshevik

196
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,949
and a star chamber this by the way was
in response to a suggestion that it

197
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:37,040
might be a good idea to let users
control their third party cookies

198
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,199
on so overheated rhetoric

199
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,630
and bogus claims politics is not a
search for truth

200
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,360
alright so how are we going to deal with
that well the first thing to deal with

201
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,500
at the first weight thing we need to do
to deal with this is to recognize that

202
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,910
the fact the politics not a search for
truth is often a feature rather than a

203
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,839
buck

204
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,699
why because politics is how democracy
plays out and democracy is not a search

205
00:11:58,699 --> 00:11:59,810
for truth

206
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,859
what democracy is is an algorithm for
resolving disagreements

207
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,370
and it's an algorithm that has a bunch
are most desirable properties right the

208
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,810
algorithm is simple

209
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,029
I we need to do X we need to do not text
I raise your hand if you want to do X

210
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,170
raise your hand if you wanna do not text
which one had more hands but will do

211
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,290
that

212
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,110
that is um thats actually very nice out
for them in many ways

213
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,690
on no question is undecidable you can
always have a vote

214
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,610
all questions in fact a decidedly
constant I'm

215
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,940
on and that is an important feature they
don't always get decided in constant

216
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,730
time but they are decide a ball

217
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,120
you can't decide what to do without
needing to decide on the underlying

218
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,870
facts

219
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,589
you can't decide whether or not to have
a carbon tax and how big should be

220
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,110
without having to decide first how much
the sea level will rise if you don't do

221
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,250
it

222
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,220
we could decide whether we need to have
so far pepper without needing to decide

223
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,690
exactly how the DNS will get busted if
we do

224
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,550
and that's a good thing we can reach a
decision with no need

225
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,519
a for Pitt for producing a coherent
explanation for why we did it

226
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,379
after an election there are all kinds of
explanations for why the voters did what

227
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,170
they did

228
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,889
but at the end of the day the result at
the 2012 presidential election is that

229
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,790
Barack Obama is President and Mitt
Romney is not

230
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,099
the rest is just commentary and the fact
that you we don't have to agree on why

231
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,009
we did what we did in order to decide is
also

232
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,459
a useful feature so democracy has a lot
to recommend it

233
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,930
even though it's not a search for truth
and yet

234
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,959
we still don't seem so happy right it
often

235
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,750
individual policy makers individual
legislators seem to behave in ways that

236
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,910
are logically inconsistent

237
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,629
and they seem to behave in ways that are
indifferent to troops

238
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,879
and we find that hard to understand it
hard to deal with

239
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,129
but politicians behave that way for a
reason

240
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,300
I'm not necessarily because they're
stupid or corrupt although

241
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,870
you know something probably are but most
are not

242
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,459
inordinate understand why it is the
politicians often behave the way they do

243
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:04,469
well that's been

244
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,639
politicians behave that way for a reason
and let me talk about why politicians

245
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,879
behave that way

246
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,430
interns a computer science so consider
the following model

247
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,550
what's model the options that government
has

248
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,120
as a set of proposals up a copy the
universal proposals on this specific

249
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,389
proposals

250
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:24,189
on the table the call p0 p1 p2 et cetera

251
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:27,610
and will soon these proposals are
independent meaning that the

252
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,240
a fact or desirability of adopting one
is not affected by adopting me up so

253
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,029
they don't

254
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,620
there's no fratricide between on and
whilst will say that a bill that thing

255
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,439
the government is considering doing is a
subset of all the possible proposals

256
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:45,099
alright will assume that a voter has a
utility function you

257
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,009
you so I for voter i which says how much
they like or dislike:

258
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,680
proposed a particular proposal and let's
say a voter supports a proposal

259
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,540
if their utility function on that
proposal is positive

260
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,719
and I will say that a proposal passes or
would pass

261
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,120
if a majority of voters supported
alright %uh not gonna make sense

262
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,649
alright and I'll make an assumption that
the behaviour boaters a sensible in a

263
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,829
certain sense

264
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,930
the given two bills that are disjoint b1
and b2 meaning they have no proposals

265
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,290
in common and remember we assume the
proposals are independent

266
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,829
that what a voter thinks about doing b1
and b2 together is just their utility

267
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,739
and b1

268
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,220
plus the utility npt right so there's a
simple corley from this you can easily

269
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,139
prove given two disjoint bills

270
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,329
if a voter supports b1 and a voter
support and that voter supports be too

271
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,719
the voter will support those two things
bundled together this is just the

272
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,629
statement that the opinions a voters the
utilities

273
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,089
are likely consistent okay

274
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,670
so now given yes um fact about the
behavior of individual voters with and

275
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,509
want to move on to prove a theorem

276
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,689
that says that the same holds for the
result of democracy that given two

277
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:53,849
disjoint bills

278
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,160
if they both passed separately the
combination would pass

279
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,209
except that's actually false

280
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,699
here's a counterexample here we have
three voters Alice bobbin Charlie

281
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,699
and two bills b1 and b2 and you can see
that

282
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:12,490
Alice likes p1 but really hate speech to
bob likes be too but really hates be

283
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,600
what it really likes them both

284
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,370
so be one passes with two votes from
else and Charlie

285
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,810
be two passes with two votes from Bob
and Charley but the combination

286
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,069
bag is voted down only Charlie supports
it and in fact if you think about it the

287
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,878
strongest result you can prove

288
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,470
is that it be one passes and B two
passes then there must be somebody who

289
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,199
will vote for the combination

290
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,870
but and real in general no more than one
person

291
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,120
so the outputs of democracy are not
logically consistent

292
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,379
even yeah the opinions have individual
voters are

293
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,459
now you might think we can fix this well
maybe maybe majority vote is a mistake

294
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,489
maybe there's some other way we can do
it maybe we can have some more

295
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,040
complicated algorithm will ask voters to
give us utilities are a call the

296
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,959
outcomes

297
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,660
and will compute the convex holler some
crazy think turns out that there are

298
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,180
fundamental impossibility results and
political science that's so you can't

299
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,520
fix this

300
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,839
on this is the way it is inputs
consistent

301
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,129
logically consistent outputs a vote not
logically consistent

302
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,250
alright let's generalize the model now a
partition the voters into district's

303
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,619
and will say that there's a legislator
with one representative legislature with

304
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,329
one representative per district

305
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,658
and the job with the legislature
legislators to do exactly what their

306
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,260
constituents want

307
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,309
the representative will support a bill
if and only if a majority of their

308
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,149
constituents would support it

309
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,330
that's what a legislator is going to do
in our model

310
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,639
okay now what are the implications of
this well first the behavior legislators

311
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,159
not logically consistent

312
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:44,980
they might support b1 and b2 separately
but not support the Union

313
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,789
why because what the legislator does is
determined by majority opinion of their

314
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,010
constituents and we already know the
majority opinion doesn't

315
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,429
give us the print this this second city
property

316
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,029
also know that the legislator in this
model doesn't care about the facts

317
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:03,340
why all they care about is whether more
of their constituents

318
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,350
are for or against the proposal the
constituents presumably care about the

319
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,908
facts but the legislators just in the
business account

320
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:15,179
so remember the slide from before what
frustrates us about legislators

321
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,289
their behaviors logically inconsistent
any different to truth

322
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,049
well here's a simple model that predicts
that that's what they would do

323
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,510
I'm now of course real life is more
complicated than that we haven't talked

324
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,820
yet about legislative strategy

325
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,110
because these bills these combinations
are proposals that are being decided

326
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,209
don't just up drop from the sky

327
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,650
on members of the legislature the party
leaders and others

328
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,299
I'm decide committee chairs decide what
the bills will be

329
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:46,320
so let's think about legislative
strategy consider the following problem

330
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,850
the amendment problem were given it some
bass bilby

331
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,260
and a set of amendments a one through a
and that we might consider adding to it

332
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,610
let's assume these are all destroyed
from each other and so the question is

333
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,020
can you add a subset

334
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,379
love these amendments to the base bill
to make a proposal

335
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,529
that will pass thats np-complete

336
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,029
on it actually it's a fun a problem to
prove it there's a

337
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,820
simple reduction from three Satter on
any other number of ways to do it

338
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,279
but this problem this simple legislative
strategy problem turns out to be

339
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,669
np-complete

340
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:21,990
so maybe these guys are smarter than we
thought they were

341
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,419
the real world the turns out is even
more complicated than that

342
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,400
the behaviour voters is not
self-consistent in real life because

343
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,230
voters

344
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,760
turns out our people people don't behave
self consistently

345
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,080
on voters apply heuristics to decide
what to do

346
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,678
and heuristics although they are very
useful an often inefficient use our

347
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,740
resources

348
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,020
don't give yourself consistencies
legislators make deals

349
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,990
that extend beyond just voting for or
against individual bills I'll vote for

350
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,580
this if you vote for that

351
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,850
i'll withdraw my name it if you agree to
give me a chat later

352
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,969
and so on all kinds of deals get made
and

353
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,289
that go outside that model so the real
world model love legislative strategies

354
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,740
even more complicated than what we've
seen so far

355
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,539
now it gets even worse in a real
government because you have not only a

356
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:13,559
legislative branch but an executive
branch I worked in the executive branch

357
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,649
agency

358
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:18,620
executive branch agencies most the
people working there are not directly

359
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,320
accountable to the voters are not
directly elected by the voters

360
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,330
instead their in directly accountable to
the voters and this indirection

361
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,370
makes things even more complicated okay

362
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,199
so what we have here is a system which

363
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,640
tends to push people to behave in ways
that seem

364
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,919
logically inconsistent and indifferent
to facts where you a very complicated

365
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,340
than interact

366
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,980
strategic issues problems that people
need to solve in order to get their work

367
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,860
done

368
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,908
so it should be no surprise that locally
the system works irrational

369
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,010
the people seem to behaving in ways that
are crazy and stupid why can't you do

370
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,879
that thing even though it seems to make
total sense

371
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,200
well the answer is that weren't trying
to solve some very difficult complicated

372
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,260
and strategic problem in order to get
something done which even though it has

373
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,549
support is hard to do

374
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,639
and the fact that the system looks
irrational locally

375
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,409
doesn't necessarily imply that the
participants are incompetent or corrupt

376
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:20,679
indeed if on not Mike my experience in
government taught me that virtually all

377
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,159
the people I work with

378
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,320
were very competent and certainly honest
on their surprising number of people

379
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,590
working really hard to do the right
thing well motivated and mostly

380
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,879
well-informed

381
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
I'm and the mystery the challenge is to
understand why it's difficult for them

382
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,570
to do

383
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,559
to do more than they do the answer to
this really is that when you talk about

384
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,690
politics

385
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,490
it's complicated okay

386
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,899
so that may be depressing or maybe it's
interesting what it tells us is there

387
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,158
something interesting to learn about
their

388
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,419
I mean that's the kind of thing we like
to do a complicated system which we'd

389
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,740
like to kinda probe in debug

390
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,590
a tinker with um thats are kinda thing
but what should we actually do

391
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,418
what should we in our community given
that we care about the outcome of many

392
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:05,490
of these processes

393
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,919
at the very least because they have the
possibility of messing up what we do

394
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,429
what should we actually do what one
thing to do is to just sit back and say

395
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,960
it's not okay did not know how the
internet works

396
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,149
olive you policy people figure out
technology and then come back to us and

397
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:21,100
we'll talk

398
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,270
but we'll just go off into our laps in
the write some code while you guys

399
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,918
figure it out

400
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,080
meanwhile you've got a whole community
of people I in

401
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,168
Washington in other capitals looking at
us and saying

402
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:35,409
what do you mean it's not okay did not
know how government works

403
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm throwing the same thing back at us
that what they do is just as interesting

404
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,929
complicated and subtle an important as
what we do

405
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,510
and if we're not willing to meet them
halfway in actually have a conversation

406
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,850
we're not going to get anything done

407
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,750
so the question is how to work together
let me talk about what

408
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,190
I think I learned in my time in
government trying to do that

409
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,510
because at as I said earlier I spent
most every day trying to work with

410
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,600
people who were not technologies to try
to get

411
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,830
useful stuff done so what does this look
like from the side of the

412
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,899
policymaker arm the first thing

413
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,949
that is clear from experience is that a
policy maker needs to be a generalist

414
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,010
I would sit in a staff meeting at the
FTC with chairman Leibowitz at the end

415
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,960
of the table

416
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,990
and there would be some decision that
needed to be made about technology

417
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,610
and it involved a bunch of complicated
technical issues which i'd studied up on

418
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,010
and I understood and I

419
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,440
you know was able to give him a crisp
explanation of why I you know I thought

420
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,570
the pros and cons with with us in such

421
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,770
on it but he had to make a decision and
you might think well he should learn all

422
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,840
that stuff that I known figure out how
to decide that the problem is sitting

423
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,779
right next to me

424
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:43,980
is somebody who needs him to make a
decision about say something simple like

425
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,029
health care economics

426
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,090
I or on our patent reform

427
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,220
or any number other on issues which

428
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,700
are just as difficult and complicated
and which are just as much a career for

429
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,289
a large number of people as

430
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,850
our stuff it's I the policymaker can't
possibly hope to learn all those details

431
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,279
what they have to be able to do is not
to understand everything

432
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,990
but to make good decisions about it
which is a different skill

433
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,539
and there's hope here because we in many
parts of our lives have learned how to

434
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,269
make good decisions about stuff

435
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,919
without being an expert for example if
you need to decide whether have knee

436
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:21,799
surgery

437
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,950
you could probably make a good decision
about that even though you're not an

438
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,010
expert in orthopedic surgery

439
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,419
how would you do that well you identify
experts you talk to them

440
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,750
UBS detect what they're saying you would
learn just enough to try to understand

441
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,390
the pros and cons

442
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,549
and then you apply the savvy you've
developed over the years there is a

443
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,340
skill to doing this

444
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,428
and it's the same kind of skilled that a
senior decision-makers needs to use

445
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:49,130
to decide about something without really
being an expert in it

446
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,429
so the goal is to make good decisions
and the fundamental at

447
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:56,809
trait you need in order to make good
decisions as to not be clueless

448
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,950
on and so let me talk about the latter
is clear for months which we I think

449
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,110
can help our policy friends climb

450
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,469
here's the letter of cluelessness the
Bonhams

451
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,510
the bottom rung of the ladder of
cluelessness and unfortunately there are

452
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,640
people who have yet to climb this

453
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,419
wrong is to recognize that expertise
exists that their is such a thing as

454
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,130
expertise in technology that some people
have and others don't

455
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,649
the technology is not something that
appears magically on the shelves at the

456
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,939
Apple Store

457
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,380
and which you then by I'm but it's
something that is built by

458
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,490
a community of people who have Claude a
bunch of knowledge

459
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,299
out of the universe over a long time
about how to do stuff

460
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:41,639
and all this know-how on all the
organization and so on and it is

461
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,380
possible for a person to know about that
stuff and predict what might happen

462
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,090
what might work and help make good
decisions that's the first step to

463
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,580
recognize the expertise

464
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,110
even exists seconds

465
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,330
the second stuff on this letter is to
recognize true experts to tell

466
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,449
if if we need to know something about
the DNS which is these people coming to

467
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,440
us and calling us

468
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,539
is a real expert in the DNS and which is
just a

469
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:11,120
on that a self-interested person who
wants us to decide a particular way

470
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,590
and the top level of the latter is to
work effectively with experts to make

471
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,220
good decisions

472
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,779
I'm and I really feel like
decision-makers climbed this ladder one

473
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,019
step at a time

474
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,679
and it's a mistake to try to jump them
I'm up multiple levels

475
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,950
the good news is that more and more
decision makers are climbing the levels

476
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,890
the latter certainly I felt like many
the people I worked with at the FTC

477
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,769
on were at the top of the latter by not
everyone is there

478
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,080
and part of what we need to do is help
people to understand

479
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,840
how to work with experts and recognize
expertise and one of the ways we can do

480
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,799
that is to

481
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,899
is to do the job well ourselves so what
about us what does it look like what is

482
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,418
the challenge for us

483
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,110
in arm in in working with
decision-makers well

484
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,260
there's a letter here the top to the
latter is to work effectively with the

485
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,399
decision maker okay

486
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,610
but how do you do that on I think a
lotta love

487
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,070
the common ideas a lot of the sort of ok
knowledge

488
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,629
about how to work with policymakers in
our community is actually wrong

489
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,000
and harmful and let me talk about why
it's wrong and hurtful and

490
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,419
on by giving an analogy the analogy is
this

491
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:20,480
suppose that your friend Sam I'm

492
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,019
came to town to your hometown you're
going to be away

493
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,309
but Sam wants to know where should we
have dinner

494
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,510
now sans the decision maker he's the one
who has to eat the meal

495
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,470
but you're the local expert you know the
restaurants you know the town and all

496
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,399
that

497
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,719
so how can you effectively help Sam make
his decision

498
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
I'm gonna walk through that process by
analogy to the way we

499
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,260
often think about working with
policymakers well the first thing we

500
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,279
like to say

501
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:49,549
when on or one thing we often like to
say in talking to policy makers

502
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:54,269
is it's not our goal to it's not our job
to get involved in policy that's dirty

503
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:58,299
lot we're just going to provide facts so
we will just provide the fax to the

504
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,940
decision maker then they can decide

505
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,919
okay so you give Sam out the menus from
all the restaurants in town

506
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,399
you give him a text book on nutrition
there you go now that's everything you

507
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,709
know maybe a map

508
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,460
now you have all the information you
need to decide right except that's not

509
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,919
actually helpful

510
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,010
because this is not why Sam called you
sam knows how to

511
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,260
use Google to find the the restaurant
menus he knows how to get

512
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,470
a text book on nutrition he probably
knows the stuff about nutrition he wants

513
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,399
to know

514
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,580
I'm that's not why he called you he
didn't want facts what he wanted was

515
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,549
your judgment

516
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:34,000
right and by just providing facts by
saying we're not going to get involved

517
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,789
in the decision-making

518
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:38,929
you are taking away the most valuable
thing you have to offer and instead

519
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,139
you're dumping a bunch of irrelevant
stuff on him

520
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:46,820
so that's not the right approach another
thing we do once we get past that often

521
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,070
is to go to the other extreme adjust to
take the decision

522
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,939
we just say okay what what i win want to
do and so what's a

523
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,710
you really like a good burger and so you
gonna send same down the street to five

524
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,779
guys

525
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,909
um and say that's really shitty you
dictating the decision

526
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,110
another might be a good decision for him
might be a terrible decision for him

527
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,799
maybe he's a vegetarian maybe is gonna
guess cholesterol check tomorrow

528
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,320
maybe he just doesn't like french fries
what whatever the reason is

529
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,939
I'm you're not be very helpful by just
telling him to go to the place that you

530
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,519
would go to

531
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,880
and in a policy-setting your
overstepping right because

532
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,220
if you tell a policymaker just you have
to do this

533
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,220
the answer will typically be well who
elected you

534
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,700
you were not elected by the people love
the great state of New Jersey

535
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,340
you were not appointed by the President
and confirmed by the senate

536
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,019
are someone else was and they're the
ones who have been vested with the

537
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,649
authority by the people

538
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,168
and therefore they're the ones we're
gonna decide it's not your job

539
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,760
on and it's also not helpful so that
approach just dictating the decision

540
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,669
also not right

541
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,769
a third approach that we sometimes wanna
fall back on is to just download our

542
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:53,889
brains okay

543
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:58,139
I'm gonna tell Sam everything I know
about restaurant in town and how I'd

544
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,620
like to decide what advice I give people

545
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,408
although my judgments about this what
you know that place on is really good if

546
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,389
you go before six o'clock but after six
it gets really crowded you have to wait

547
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,158
a long time the service is awful

548
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,639
et cetera well looking but Sam doesn't
want a PhD in

549
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:16,570
on in but the local restaurants he just
wants to know where to eat

550
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,149
so that's not so useful either and it
doesn't work no decision maker has the

551
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:22,299
time Sam will tell you to shut up

552
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:26,059
and he'll make his decision himself i
single eventually get to that point

553
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:29,678
so what can you do that would actually
be useful

554
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,919
it will be useful you need to find a way
to combine your knowledge

555
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,679
with the decision maker's preferences or
more accurately with their knowledge and

556
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,840
preferences because they are things that
they know that you don't know

557
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,590
in working with that it for example in
working with my boss at the FTC I knew a

558
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,529
lot about the technical issues and

559
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:48,149
often the positions are the different
companies and groups on a particular

560
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:49,279
question

561
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,679
I'm but my boss the chairman new

562
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,470
what could actually be done politically
that he knew that if we did X then

563
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,000
senator why would be really angry and we
wouldn't

564
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,360
be able to to achieve our goal I'm so
knowledge in preferences this is often

565
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,408
sorta misstated by saying it's your
facts plus their values

566
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,440
but it's not fax pas values its
knowledge plus knowledge and preferences

567
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,470
so how do you actually do that well
here's how you do it with Sam

568
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,309
you're asking a lot of questions all
rights and how much time do you have

569
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:23,330
what's your budget are you a vegetarian
do you like spicy food do you have a car

570
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,480
are you a foodie how much do you care
about atmosphere verses

571
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,210
versus quality of food um are you an
adventurous eater et cetera et cetera

572
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,299
tell me about a restaurant you like in
your hometown

573
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,730
get all the information I have an idea
what he actually wants what he actually

574
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,389
likes

575
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:43,459
you have his knowledge in preferences
now you structure the decision space

576
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,259
that is you don't make the decision for
it but you say here a couple good

577
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:47,210
options

578
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,139
well you know there's a pretty good
Italian bistro just across the street

579
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:51,360
from your hotel

580
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,620
it's really convenient it's maybe a
little more expensive than you wanted

581
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,279
and

582
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,429
in and the food is only good not great
but it's super convenient maybe you want

583
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:00,059
to go there

584
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,970
but if you need ventures in an
adventurous mood you willing to ride in

585
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,330
the cab disagreed Ethiopian place over
in such and such

586
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,149
on got no atmosphere at all but you know
it's an experience is a clone your

587
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,120
experience that you won't forget

588
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,699
on whatever it is based on what he's
told you about what he likes and doesn't

589
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,480
like what he's willing to do what his
budget is and all that

590
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,620
you give him a few choices and you say
hear your choices

591
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,239
and here's the pros and cons of those
choices in terms of the things you care

592
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,549
about

593
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,000
that's a process that actually works and
I often use this as a model for trying

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to understand

595
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,809
how to work with the decision maker to
get them to a good decision

596
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:38,259
so one thing to notice about this is

597
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:42,909
that on it involves a lot of
communication

598
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,330
a lot of communication over time on

599
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,970
that you have to ask Sam a lot of
questions to get answers

600
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,200
kill you ask followup questions if
you're smart

601
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,679
after he's done this York your last
campaign

602
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,130
what did you decide to do how did it
work out and you learn some more about

603
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,190
what you like snow next time he comes to
town you're in a much better position to

604
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,529
give him advice more quickly more
efficiently

605
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:09,429
on and on he may tell you more about
what he wants

606
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,190
this is a multi round protocol it has to
be

607
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,720
on in order to be effective you have to
be engaged over time

608
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,080
so the success love this depends

609
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,860
on engagement over time with the
decision maker and depends on building

610
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,918
an environment of trust

611
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,429
with the decision maker so that arm

612
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,279
so that they come to trust that the
advice that you're giving them is

613
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,120
given straight its honest and you're not
trying to push them to you

614
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,080
what you wanna do you're not trying to
dictate their decisions through the back

615
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,990
door

616
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,919
on and they're willing to trust that
you've done your homework and that

617
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,309
they're not going to you

618
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:51,769
on make some horrible a series of tubes
blunder

619
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:55,639
by taking your advice on and you need to
learn to trust

620
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:58,840
that on to let them make the decision

621
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,918
on and if that engagement overtime and
building a trusted that allows an

622
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:03,710
actually

623
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,730
productive on relationship to happen

624
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,719
and that leads to better policy-making
until we do that

625
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,408
are it's going to be very difficult for
us to influence the way policymakers

626
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,490
actually

627
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,790
work all right so what is the role of
our community then

628
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,500
in trying to improve the policy process

629
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,760
on given that we need to be engaged that
we need to build trust

630
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,849
um if follows that if we're going to
have a real influence on the political

631
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:33,760
and policy process

632
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,190
we need to have boots on the ground here
in washington

633
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,780
any other capitals there's no substitute
for

634
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,020
actually being there engaging with the
decision maker overtime

635
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,079
and building that relationship of trust
so that when something important comes

636
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,450
up you can call them and say hey

637
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,980
I see this thing is before you let me
tell you it would be a mistake to do

638
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,470
axion here's why

639
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,339
well let me tell you there's a factor
you might not see on

640
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:04,420
in order to get people to take that
seriously they have to know you and they

641
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,569
have to trust

642
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,869
had built trust over time that you are
giving them

643
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,220
that your source a good advice so we
need to have people here we need to have

644
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,790
people here over time

645
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,869
it's all well and good to send letters
it's all well and good to you

646
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,800
on sign petitions on pay visits to your
legislators are policymakers that's all

647
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,540
good I

648
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,500
at the FTC love to have people from my
community common visit

649
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,660
I didn't I think have enough visits or
at enough

650
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,920
sorry email saying hey take a look at
this some as I would have liked

651
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,560
but nonetheless um a true influence
comes from heavy boots on the ground

652
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,529
over time

653
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,880
so what does that mean for our community
first of all if you're at a career stage

654
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,650
where

655
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,980
it's possible I would urge you to
consider doing what I did what Steve

656
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,089
on I is is doing and and what other
folks in the community

657
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:56,230
have done and that is taking a time out
taking a sabbatical

658
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,579
from your career coming in working in in
your government

659
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:04,569
arm their I'm there are positions a
growing number of positions where

660
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:08,310
folks with the knowledge that in this
room can really do a lot of good

661
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,328
in moving the policy process forward
there are a lot of operations

662
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,770
type positions as well a lot love tool
development

663
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,740
a lot of funding related um things that

664
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,020
that folks in our community can do but I
would urge you also to work in the

665
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,650
policy or in two parts

666
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,069
on the government take some time and do
it I spent a year and a half and I think

667
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:29,520
that

668
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,040
I'm I think a year is probably the
minimum length of time

669
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,460
that you can be productively on that you
could do something like this

670
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,329
productively on so if you had a career
stage to do this consider doing it

671
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,599
yourself you'd be surprised how much you
learn

672
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,220
how many interesting people you meet
including many interesting people from

673
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,049
your own community you come in for
meetings with the

674
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,040
with the decision-makers for people who
are

675
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,970
earlier in their careers for people who
are at the entry level or students now

676
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,129
we need to figure out how to build a
career path that involves doing this

677
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,680
kind of work

678
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,169
I saw this at the FTC we had some
excellent

679
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,960
entry-level technologists people who
people who were really good

680
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,680
on and contributed a lot had high impact
within the agency

681
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,069
on and then we had my position as the
chief technologist but the challenge was

682
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:24,099
how a person could get from that entry
level position to a more senior position

683
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,420
we need to figure out we need to work
with entities in government

684
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,400
to you figure out how to develop a
career path for people who are really

685
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,310
good strong technologists

686
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,279
and want to do policy related work and
build a career in doing it

687
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,079
aren't there are cats for this but not
nearly as many as there could be

688
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,109
we also need to think about how we
should structure the way that we train

689
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:46,670
people

690
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,500
and deal with people to make sure that a
person who chooses that kind of career

691
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,260
path

692
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,819
is able to stay integrated with our
community in able to get the benefits

693
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:59,270
I love participating in our discourse
and being able to do things like

694
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,609
attend conferences and publish papers on
and all that

695
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:06,430
on we need to make sure that it doesn't
that this kind of work doesn't become a

696
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,598
sort of ghetto that people can go into

697
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,210
but I'm not come out of arm

698
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,250
so we need to think about how to create
that career path and support it

699
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,040
this is something we can do in
universities in training students it's

700
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,509
something that companies can do

701
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,470
but it's also something we need to think
about as a community how to engage

702
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,560
we need to think about how to build
incentives for people to actually do

703
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,140
this

704
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,990
so that it's not seen as a second-class
job and it's not seen as something that

705
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,729
someone does because they were unable to
do

706
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,020
real work because this work actually
matters a lot

707
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,259
and the quality of people doing it is
very important

708
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,560
this stuff is really important for us

709
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,190
on if if we've seen anything happening

710
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,000
in the policy world over the past five
to 10 years

711
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,450
it's been a move from a situation where
most policymakers

712
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,759
didn't deal with internet in technology
issues

713
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,200
to a situation today where there is a
hearing

714
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,970
there is some kind of out
inside-the-beltway

715
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:11,439
event every day about our stuff there
are important decisions on the plates

716
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,550
i've seen your decision makers also
government

717
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,050
in the legislature every day that relate
to our stuff

718
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,819
we see book law encroaching on things we
do

719
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,329
we r have concerns about things like the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the DMCA

720
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,099
and other laws

721
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,319
that gets fixed through these sorts of
processes we see things like soap and

722
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:34,400
paper bubbling up that's not the last
time that something like that is going

723
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
to try to happen

724
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,880
there are a lot of important things that
are going on here and not just threats

725
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,130
to what we do

726
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,270
but also important opportunities that
are not being

727
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,280
identified we have an opportunity

728
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,089
to do a much better job educating the
next generation

729
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:53,770
of computer scientists which we are not
seizing

730
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,460
a partly because our government doesn't
know how to do it this stuff is really

731
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,450
important

732
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,078
this is a this is one of the most
important issues facing the country

733
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,920
on and facing other countries interns
author how to build a future that's

734
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,390
actually going to be good

735
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,549
and on we need to be in the room when

736
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,550
these decisions are made days there's a
saying in washington

737
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,319
that the most important thing is to be
in the room

738
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,710
and certainly that's the case to be in
the room when the decision is made so

739
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,270
you can speak up

740
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,290
we need to be in that room because these
sorts of decisions are much too

741
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,619
important to be left

742
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:35,619
to politicians thanks

743
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,030
suck left ample time for Q&A which

744
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,030
come this is a topic that is I hope
lends itself to that so

745
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:53,030
please am come on up you

746
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,380
24 from Johns Hopkins and I have a an
observation

747
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,810
I appreciate your comments on and that
is what I see to be

748
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,440
and an important here paradox its
emerging in society

749
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,860
that is that the more information
becomes accessible to people

750
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,120
the more uninformed their behaviors
appear to be

751
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,440
and I believe that the underlying reason
is that people are more like

752
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,620
say I don't know on

753
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:33,930
sure on let's see

754
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:39,660
well certainly um certainly I think
experience has shown that

755
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,670
making a lot more information available
the people has not made people

756
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,330
a lot smarter has not made them much
better decision-makers

757
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,160
on the whole on but I don't know that I
would go as far

758
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,640
is you did in saying that on in at least
implying that it might actually be

759
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,440
actively

760
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,540
handful I think we put too much it's
easy to put too much faith

761
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,020
in access to information mom but

762
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,310
on without recognizing enough people
need to have skills to use that

763
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:08,970
information

764
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:13,049
and this probably goes to the idea that
politics is not a search for truth

765
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,230
somebody's not searching for truth if
they searching for confirmation of their

766
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,290
existing police

767
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,500
then are more information may make it
easier for them

768
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,630
to do that mom but I think it's

769
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,940
always been that way own in the sense

770
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,260
that when people didn't have information
there was a tendency to fill in the gaps

771
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,480
in a way that was convenient

772
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,170
on instead of picking and choosing from
low-quality facts available to them

773
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,190
they could just make assumptions arm

774
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,310
so I mean I think it's really important
to arm to understand

775
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,460
how we can turn information access

776
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,060
into better decisions and it's something
we can try to do as a community

777
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,600
but understanding on the

778
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,250
sort of the sociology anthropology of
political

779
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,260
information is something that's really
important on

780
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,180
and i think is gonna take a long time to
work out I think we're just starting to

781
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,620
see the impact of information
technologies on politics and political

782
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,359
debate

783
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,240
months can be really interesting to see
it develop going forward

784
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:21,240
X mining you yawn from Google so

785
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,190
I would actually like a practical piece
of advice from you can't afford those of

786
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,630
us who cannot take a sabbatical right
now but

787
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,640
would still like to start building a
trusting Marie

788
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,240
relationship with people in Washington
or in policymaking

789
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,790
positions how can I do that how can we
actually reach them and start saying

790
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,150
pay about this issue I believe X&Y sure

791
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,410
on they're a bunch of these

792
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,490
you can do um certainly

793
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:56,490
that one one of the important things to
do is to identify contact point on a

794
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,080
particular issue

795
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,650
there many issues going on um I and you
could start with

796
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,080
one-issue or cluster of issues and try
to find

797
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,819
a particular either a policy maker or
else their staff for you can talk to you

798
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,460
arm identity as with anything else
identifying who's the correct person to

799
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,670
talk to is a big part

800
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,670
the challenge on and if their members

801
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:25,720
of our community who know or their arm
organizations that

802
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,299
that work with um that

803
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,330
have worked with governments over time
arm unthinking for example have USA cm

804
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,680
which is the ACM's Public Policy
Committee

805
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,560
mom that is a group of computer
scientists who engage with these issues

806
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,470
on and one way they to take a dip your
toe in the water is to get involved with

807
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,319
the group like that IEEE has a

808
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,980
has a similar group IEEE USA on that's
certainly one way to you

809
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,890
on are two diff your foot in the water
to learn a little bit about what's going

810
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,930
on how to you

811
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:59,120
to engage on but often it's true getting
that contact with the person to

812
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,500
build the trust with onto have a
relationship in discussion with

813
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,690
is is difficult and sometimes it's a the
person is a staffer

814
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,850
on like um that

815
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,630
as I said you know senior decision
makers have a lot of demands on their

816
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,120
time

817
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,890
and they rely a lot and support from
their staff on

818
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,410
and having a well educated staff member
I'm educating staff member well

819
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,140
on may have a bigger influence the
talking directly to the decision maker

820
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,629
so it's another opportunity and and um I
am

821
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,910
and and many other staff members in
places like this especially on capitol

822
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,310
hill

823
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,880
are our young and I may be people who on

824
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,190
are reachable through the school
networks or

825
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,200
or something else or if you own a
company like Google your own company

826
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,560
has people who engage with government
although probably typically

827
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,120
um corporate I government affairs people
prefer to you

828
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,440
I'm do that stuff themselves

829
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,080
rather than having employees I'm
speaking on

830
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,390
certainly on behalf of the company but
there may be opportunities to learn more

831
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,200
about what's going on in about certain
issues

832
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,779
you break-in running

833
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,510
so one other thing there

834
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,650
they may have a legislative affairs
means they can contact with and they're

835
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,580
usually good work with people

836
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,520
I'll wanna get on the issues so the
question is

837
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,190
what'd you you talk about have felt that
you have people listening to you

838
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,490
and maybe doing what you suggest in
kinda

839
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,500
how that changed you're thinking sure
other

840
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,490
everything yeah yet so actually the the
suggestion about University

841
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,500
on let legislative affairs people is

842
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,350
on is a good one in actually one more
that I should have added as well

843
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,069
is um there may be somebody you know
from this Community or somebody from

844
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,180
this Community since

845
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,710
like Steve elephant currently at the FTC
on

846
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,630
for the next what two weeks

847
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,180
about right

848
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,430
to somebody likes this somebody like me
when I was they are Steve are having

849
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,290
children has been at the FCC

850
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,759
on you know people who come out at the
tech community you were in government

851
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,300
done just a cold email to those folks
often will I'm will be productive

852
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,600
on so on the quick the the

853
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,450
the question about what was it like to
you have someone

854
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:27,069
listen to me um well first of all you
know I should say that I did

855
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,700
a lot of due diligence before going into
the job

856
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,850
and so I think I had a realistic
understanding of what

857
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,330
I might or might not be able to you
achieve arm

858
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,690
and one other things that became clearer
is that

859
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,490
in figuring out what to do I really
needed to work with

860
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,899
um the people within the FTC who had a
lot of important knowledge

861
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,380
I didn't have like the congressional
relations people on

862
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,610
who really understand where the pieces
are

863
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,710
on the congressional chessboard

864
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,160
and how those relationships need to be

865
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,379
developed on people who work with

866
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,770
other decision makers and so on um in
order to get something done

867
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,980
you really have to socialize the idea
within

868
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,590
government and there are lots of other
people who have expertise that can help

869
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,220
you do that

870
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,220
and I found myself I think much more in
a website

871
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,939
of people who are a team of people who
were bringing different expertise to a

872
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:28,570
problem

873
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:34,530
on van on in a sort of situation where I
was talking and then people were taking

874
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,770
advantage of what I said

875
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,940
certainly um that was the case on but I
knew going in

876
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:45,280
that that the folks I was talking to
would trust

877
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,770
that I knew what I was talking about on
the technical stuff

878
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:52,950
on and I worked pretty early on to you

879
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,540
develop a report with them about the
policy trade-offs arm

880
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,450
it I am

881
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:04,899
I think I'm

882
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,240
a little bit more hopeful about the
possibility of love

883
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,310
accomplishing something in this kind of
position having done it

884
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,900
I certainly recognize that it's very
hard to do anything in government

885
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,610
and that the government was designed
that way on purpose arm

886
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,730
checks and balances the checks and
balances that you read about in your

887
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,820
civics textbook

888
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,590
affect every single government employees
every day on

889
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,650
there are a lot of people who need to be
kept happy in order for

890
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,670
you and your colleagues to be able to
keep doing their jobs

891
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,080
and on and its it's difficult to do
things

892
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,210
are but certainly learn much more about
the mechanics of doing that

893
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,430
on it's closer to university politics
then

894
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:47,730
on you might think over here

895
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:53,370
on so far left yes I'm william coulter
with Johns Hopkins University Applied

896
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,460
Physics Laboratory

897
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,240
I some just wondering how did you learn
on this did you know this

898
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,330
day one was are finishing school for you
before he started

899
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,049
not really arm so I've been working

900
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,210
on policy issues for a while

901
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,620
um I got involved in on

902
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:17,960
in tech policy initially through two
things one was the coming at the DMCA

903
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,400
where where tech policy really intruded
into my world another was

904
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,660
on a2 time I spent working on the
Microsoft antitrust case working as

905
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,810
an expert witness an advisor to the

906
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,110
to the Department of Justice on that
well I really got to see

907
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,840
government decision-making in the
interaction of law and economics and

908
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,190
and in politics and technology in
interesting ways so that got me

909
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,860
interested

910
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,610
I spent time studying and working out I
worked on it through ACM another

911
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,120
groups and engaging in arm

912
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,970
in the policy process I started to go to
where conferences

913
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,209
nom about these things and

914
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:01,620
on sir get integrated in that community
so was a long process of talking to

915
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,109
people

916
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:05,700
at the time when I started I think there
was less knowledge within our own

917
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,720
community about how to do it I think
there's more now than there used to be

918
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,109
certainly more interesting these issues
on but it's something you have to learn

919
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,670
over time in much of what I said here

920
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:20,170
is not I think I would not have been
able to give this talk before I work the

921
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,980
government on what a lot of it is shaped
by the experience

922
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,840
I had

923
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,230
joking I re tech University Denmark
thanks

924
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:36,230
agree talk good stuff one question I
have is

925
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,030
having now been a professor in Europe
and worked with

926
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,770
decision makers and politicians in three
different countries

927
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,980
there's a difference between the
politicians and decision-makers I've

928
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,840
worked with those in america

929
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,180
and warning if the difference matters
because I found it frustrating

930
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,419
in particular as an example in Denmark's
legislature

931
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,150
we do not have a single person educated

932
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,390
in science engineering medicine or
anything else

933
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:08,819
where and as well as in for example
ministry positions but in america

934
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,260
that tastes different does it matter
should I have been this frustrated

935
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,560
as I was dealing with professional
politicians

936
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,940
on certainly the lack love politicians

937
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,300
screen since sciences and the and
technical stuff generally

938
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,320
is a real issue on

939
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,820
I'm lucky living in Princeton New Jersey
to have

940
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,600
be represented by a congressman whose
and honest to goodness physicist

941
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,460
with a PhD in physics and you can talk
to him in terms of Statistics any

942
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,810
understands what you said the first time

943
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,710
on that's a rare thing um

944
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:48,880
but it and truly rare that if you look
at

945
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,610
the you know the Senate plus the house
of representatives you have

946
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:57,390
what's three people maybe who have on
science technology

947
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,470
math I'm serious training on and that
becomes an issue

948
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,270
on a lot of it goes to the culture gap

949
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,730
much of the culture gap I think comes
from the fact that there are these very

950
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,750
different

951
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,140
career paths on and it plays out in
different ways

952
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,060
on one of the things that drove me crazy
especially at first

953
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,080
was an assumption in some circles that

954
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,400
knowledge of technology disqualifies you

955
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,590
from participating in a policy
discussion

956
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,540
if you know about technology you must
not know it follows that you probably

957
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,540
don't know

958
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,200
about policy arm

959
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,279
and in some circles that's a difficult

960
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,410
to overcome of course we do that to them
to

961
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,680
right someone who actually walks in a
member of congress who walks in here and

962
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,319
start talking about technology might
actually know what they're talking about

963
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,320
but we'll probably think

964
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,200
0 at first as a politician therefore
they don't know I think that culture gap

965
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,700
I'm is partly driven by the fact that
there are so few people

966
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,740
in the senior positions who are trained
in our

967
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,290
disciplines but I think that will change
if you look

968
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,120
at the junior people at the junior staff
level people who are maybe in their 20

969
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,970
late twenties early thirties

970
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,080
you see a lot more for more
sophisticated

971
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,390
on you see a lot more staffers who have
taken computer science classes

972
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,069
on you see people sometimes even you
have bachelor's degrees

973
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,470
on in some these positions on and

974
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,609
I think in the long run that will be
helpful mom

975
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,620
nonetheless you know it's a problem

976
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:37,250
that we don't have people in on with
serious training and expertise

977
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,720
to play a role in that community and
feel like they fit in

978
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,040
this is one of the reasons why by the
way it's important to let people build a

979
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,840
career

980
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,140
because often the path to being a senior
decision-makers starts with being a

981
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:54,000
junior staff member in climbing that
ladder

982
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,630
Agni II came up in response person from
google but

983
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,300
excellent all covering bases on a great
although arms

984
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,310
arm I was going to suggest that the best
way

985
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:08,950
I'm getting involved is a long-term
approach

986
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:13,049
every two years or something all the
campaign

987
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,840
its sometimes congressional campaign
think quite exciting

988
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,120
actually and state Rep and sis

989
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,180
our senate ones as well arm up

990
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,870
what they also need are people who can
set up the printer

991
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,160
make the rover work keep the wireless
are

992
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:36,490
talked to Comcast when the lines lines
down am have anybody can do that

993
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,709
you probably also have to answer
telephones and and you know wat some

994
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,720
districts

995
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,149
when you want to find out your
legislative preferences that's the way

996
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,290
to do it because they have a message
that they want you to communicate with

997
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:47,940
voters

998
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,160
and that's how you learn it those people
you're participate in campaigns with

999
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,000
about half of them are gonna go on to be
staffers

1000
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,310
those the people who you were going to
talk to

1001
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:04,040
when you want to bring up an issue on
capitol hill

1002
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,360
it's a long-term relationship building
process I've been working in campaigns

1003
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,910
every even-numbered years since nineteen

1004
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,609
77 78 time frame and so when

1005
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,710
I came to be to the CNN capitol hill

1006
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:21,770
on Monday I stop often visit my
senatorial officers

1007
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,050
because I already know half of their
staffers in ma on my senators

1008
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,680
chief-of-staff

1009
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,370
arm you takes a very long time to build
these relationships

1010
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:35,009
and to understand what he was saying
what other preferences

1011
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:39,030
where are they coming from it's not just
enough to go in and tell them what they

1012
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,090
ought to do

1013
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:45,030
but for people with Google I'm sure the
company will give you a month off

1014
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,840
you know in in October to go and work on
a congressional campaign

1015
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,410
are most companies will do something
like that I'm that's what I would

1016
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,660
suggest

1017
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,810
this this is I think excellent advice
and I would even maybe go a little bit

1018
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,549
further

1019
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,800
which is that there is a transformation
going on

1020
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,070
now in how political campaigns are run

1021
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,540
a move to being much more analytical
much more data-driven

1022
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,620
on and on much its much more analytical
about the sort of strategy and the

1023
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,250
dynamics running a campaign and that
means there's a need for

1024
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,980
a technical expertise and a lot of
people in the political world know they

1025
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,950
need some at this tech magic that the
Obama people had

1026
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,750
they don't know what exactly it is on
but a lot of it is the kinda stuff that

1027
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,130
is

1028
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,270
our bread and butter as computer
scientists on

1029
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:37,530
and so there's a there and so I think
the opportunity to

1030
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:42,640
apply that your expertise to you
campaign is actually only going to grow

1031
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,740
on and on and is a great opportunity
there to build that relationship

1032
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,600
and certainly engagement overtime with
your own representatives

1033
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,839
is is one way to get there

1034
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,970
so I I think this 10 I'm Chris what
their from georgetown

1035
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,069
am I think I think this issue will be
alleviated a little bit as more people

1036
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,070
move into

1037
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,980
you know kind of what you're suggesting
but how do we help people

1038
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,440
now identify as a community how do we
help people identify

1039
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,860
who the experts are so identify quacks
for

1040
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,090
lack of a better word because there are
a lot of them in

1041
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,980
technology possibly because people don't
know a lot about

1042
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,830
yes um well one thing that is important
is

1043
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,990
just to help people recognize what kinds
of credentials are

1044
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:32,589
actually mom actually

1045
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,670
signify expertise right

1046
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,000
mom you could tells so-and-so you know
so-and-so

1047
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,360
on is a longtime member of the Internet
architecture board

1048
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,950
write to us that mean something to arms

1049
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,740
to somebody in the political world maybe
not it's just you know some

1050
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,520
internet-related

1051
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,900
think arm summit is is that summit

1052
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:58,220
is a networking thing right arm are my
friends from the FTC

1053
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,299
will sometimes call me up and say hey
arm

1054
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,850
we want an expert on topic axes person
why a good choice

1055
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,490
on do they know what they're talking
about on that topic so that networking

1056
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,419
also helps

1057
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,800
right I'm arm

1058
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,420
and some ovett is just general BS
detection skills

1059
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,430
mom and that's something that often um

1060
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,569
I steeple probably agree with this this
is I found at me

1061
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:25,930
that often that was my role in a meeting
known

1062
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,690
the my goal was to sit there and either
call BS or not call BS on what some

1063
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:33,070
somebody was saying and it wasn't so
much that that

1064
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:37,950
the um the things that they were saying
required a lot of expertise

1065
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,560
to do it's just that I could say that's
right you know any sophomore computer

1066
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,410
science major could say that's one but I
could say that's one lobbying and I

1067
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,899
think the professor

1068
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,410
on was somehow was better on

1069
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,730
so yes so partly to long-term education
process

1070
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,730
people knowing what arm you know that
someone being the program chair at the

1071
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,400
USENIX security conference

1072
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,830
probably means they know what they're
talking about when it comes to security

1073
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,640
or even being a program committee

1074
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,730
knowing what that means mom on

1075
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,930
that sorta stuff is goes a long way

1076
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:15,529
on and on that's part of it part of it
though

1077
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:19,030
is arm this strange

1078
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:23,150
some was seemingly strange to ass model
that often applies

1079
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:28,000
in on DC debates where credibility comes
from

1080
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,250
on not from knowledge but credibility
calms

1081
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,740
from on having a stake in the outcome

1082
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:39,609
where the fact that somebody works for
company axe is much more important than

1083
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,810
who they are what they know

1084
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,810
on and the fact that company X has a
stake in the outcome

1085
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:49,290
on the issue there is actually seen as
qualifying that person to give

1086
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,850
advice about how to do it and that seems
backwards to us but

1087
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:57,310
and they're actually on reasons in terms
of political incentives for white would

1088
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,070
work that way

1089
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:02,310
wire Michael Hicks from University
Berlin so

1090
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,610
I'm I'm wondering about advice you can
give is going the other direction so

1091
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,880
this talk was about

1092
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,910
how experts can help policymakers

1093
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:13,350
if I think my job as a researcher as a
professor and

1094
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,460
I think I'm trying to serve the public
good I'm trying to help you produce

1095
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,310
ideas that are reproducible that people
can take a great

1096
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:23,630
be more ideas on how to help society and
that's can influence policy

1097
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,180
so is their way that we as researchers
might be

1098
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,640
could do our job better that the
enterprise could be better run

1099
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,140
and based on your experience sure arm

1100
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:41,310
I think this is in some ways it's like
technology transfer

1101
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:45,570
right um that research is valuable in
its own we're building this week on a

1102
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,110
wall of knowledge brick by brick

1103
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:50,610
you know you you know all the metaphors
their on

1104
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,840
by um

1105
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,850
bite to the extent that you can think

1106
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,339
about choosing problems for example

1107
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,850
based on how they connect to policy
issues that matter

1108
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,360
arm somebody's things like which
problems you choose

1109
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,580
some ovett is ways of communicating your
results to go beyond publishing a paper

1110
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,310
for this community

1111
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:17,900
to spend some effort on explaining

1112
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,830
the significance if your work to
policymakers are to the public

1113
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:25,840
um sometimes just um

1114
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,870
emailing someone in government you know
who might be interested

1115
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:33,180
um this happen to me a buncha time
somebody just

1116
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,250
you know somebody who I knew in this
community will email me hey I we've got

1117
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,200
this new paper that might be interested
in

1118
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,600
that somebody there might be interested
in I would look at it leader pass it on

1119
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,089
or not

1120
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:45,770
I'm thats also it's also useful

1121
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:49,060
arm so I would think that like
technology transfer roughly right you're

1122
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,170
choosing problems and you're
communicating

1123
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:55,340
on and I found I had a sort a career
change

1124
01:02:55,340 --> 01:03:00,420
on career course adjustment about ten
years ago when I started doing

1125
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,530
policy work Policy Research in addition
to computer science research

1126
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:09,660
and so now I actually have a hat as a
computer science professor anna has a

1127
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,970
public policy professor have to be
taking my time on and off

1128
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:16,299
I miss across the country arm but one
thing I found is

1129
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:20,000
that it's surprising how often knowledge

1130
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,350
and research in one area helps me pick a
good research topic in the other area

1131
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:31,020
on that understanding what matters from
a policy standpoint can

1132
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,150
help you identify problems that you
might identify otherwise

1133
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:38,130
and vice versa

1134
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,900
I'm skyping with a cybersecurity
research group the HS

1135
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,110
like to shift your focus a little bit
you talked about communications between

1136
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:50,100
sort the technology technical areas in
the policy world whether that's

1137
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,500
executive or legislative review judicial

1138
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,930
without necessarily going to specific
instances can you say something about

1139
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,819
where you see that conversation

1140
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:03,620
working reasonably well today and where
it's not working very well and I'm

1141
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,170
talkin

1142
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:08,790
problems in our problems you seek we're
gonna have to grapple

1143
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,200
well let's see arm

1144
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,129
where is it working well well so there
some situations some problems I think

1145
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,910
cybersecurity as a

1146
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:22,779
government policy issue is a very
difficult one for a whole lot of

1147
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,400
institutional reasons

1148
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,110
I think we understand the problem really
well on

1149
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:33,740
by um and we would be ready to move
toward a solution

1150
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,509
if on

1151
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:41,300
if bomb

1152
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,740
if it strong a definite strategy emerged

1153
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,120
on so that that I see is a partial
success

1154
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,910
I found in um actually at the FTC

1155
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:57,660
I think the discussion around consumer
privacy was one where

1156
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:01,350
we had a robust interaction between the
research community

1157
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,390
and on in government which didn't

1158
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:08,960
always mean that each group did what the
other wanted or was

1159
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,770
I totally happy with what the other
community did but at least we had

1160
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:17,200
all a water gun or change a water flow
of information in a really productive

1161
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,410
conversation I think that's an area
where the research community has had a

1162
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,779
lot of influence

1163
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:25,680
that's an area where I can tell you that
FTC commissioners read papers written by

1164
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,220
people in this room

1165
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:30,240
mom and on and me just

1166
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,620
they're thinking mom

1167
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:37,529
so i think thats one I'm I also think
there's a long

1168
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:40,980
there's a good history love arm

1169
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,270
a lot of the basic Sourav on

1170
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,860
the way in which the government arm
helped to you

1171
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,770
I bring about the sort of birth and
growth of the Internet

1172
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:55,420
and then set it free in a relatively on
arm

1173
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:59,240
in relatively good way I think the story
of the government

1174
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:04,220
um fostering the growth of the Internet
and then not messing up too much

1175
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:08,240
on actually is a real success story in
one where some very

1176
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,799
I'm smart and thoughtful people in
government and in the tech community

1177
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,460
were able to work together

1178
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,600
well I guess if I 2.21 success that you

1179
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,290
that

1180
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:25,130
I'll ask another just needs our gum

1181
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,610
what's your sense for what you're
willing to take away from your

1182
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:30,470
experience here with what you see
happening

1183
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:33,799
both technically legislatively elsewhere
in the world then

1184
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,210
comes back to us also arm

1185
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:41,900
what thats a tough when you definitely
you know working

1186
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,410
within a policy part of the US
government you're definitely US

1187
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:48,450
focused there's no doubt that

1188
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:52,129
mom relationships with your peers in
other countries

1189
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,180
matter arm on some issues

1190
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:59,859
more than others arm as a law
enforcement agency

1191
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:04,410
cooperation with our international
colleagues mattered a lot

1192
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:08,549
on because on a lot of the specially the

1193
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:12,200
a technology related scams that we don't
with winter national

1194
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,509
in in nature arm I found

1195
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,720
that he intercourse

1196
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,600
arm this the relation to you

1197
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,240
international to you um

1198
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,490
the political process and the policy
process and other countries is something

1199
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:34,080
which was primarily handled by
specialized

1200
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,490
group of people within the FTC who I
would work with so I don't feel like

1201
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:40,540
I have much greater knowledge how

1202
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,810
on this plays out in a political and
policy

1203
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:47,670
way in other countries as a result I've
having done the job

1204
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:51,590
I did on I saw the I saw glimpses into
that but

1205
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:54,720
most of what I know about that I'm is

1206
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:01,720
I learned two channels that I still have
you know just people here for example

1207
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,470
min

1208
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:10,669
who I'm young people from the defense
with some

1209
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,970
are II you come back to the topic of

1210
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,559
of privacy that you alluded to in the
for use a response

1211
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,630
on to be more specific as you know

1212
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:24,489
many people in the world make use of a
service provided by your

1213
01:08:24,488 --> 01:08:29,568
us-based companies and some local
service but might give it sends it even

1214
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:30,790
from the point of view

1215
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:34,040
data protection as and

1216
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,278
might use was some different difference
or of perception

1217
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,890
about about privacy between for example
US and Europe

1218
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,440
so to what extent in your experience are
is

1219
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,649
on all yeah is

1220
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:52,879
the the FTC arm let's see

1221
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,890
motivated why making sure that the

1222
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,239
image of american corporations are

1223
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,129
is let's see pristine up from that point
of view

1224
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:07,299
are as perceived by citizens of the
world

1225
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:12,410
chart on well so let me talk about that
more generally in the first caveat I

1226
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,160
have to give

1227
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,809
is that my time at the FTC was before
all the recent revelations about

1228
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:21,000
on US government surveillance so

1229
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,310
that was not an issue that I dealt with
although i certainly

1230
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:28,089
have opinions about it um the

1231
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:31,460
also the mission at the FTC is

1232
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:36,109
on relates to you if you divide the
spacer privacy into you

1233
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:40,370
privacy as against government as opposed
to privacy as against companies

1234
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:44,019
arm the FTC only worked on privacy as
against

1235
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:49,700
companies on and that still an area in
which the perception is that the US

1236
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,420
is more lax in data protection then I'm

1237
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,989
then europeans arm what I think I saw

1238
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:02,929
was that arm actually it's a little more
complicated than the common view

1239
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:05,980
that the rules in Europe

1240
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:10,419
are more strict I'm companies in terms
of behavior but the US has stronger

1241
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,260
enforcement of the rules at house

1242
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:18,670
yes mom and partly because the FTC
institutionally has more power for

1243
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,320
example the power to issue

1244
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,370
subpoenas compared to many other
European

1245
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:26,690
data protection on authorities on

1246
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,710
the need to work together

1247
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:34,300
I and have a single set above rules that
companies can follow is

1248
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,370
very important arm that said

1249
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:41,210
the FTC is an agent of the US government
and therefore

1250
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:46,550
is fundamentally going to be more
interested in the opinions if US

1251
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:51,070
companies and people then in non-u_s_ on

1252
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:54,980
people they they they're interested in
the opinions of the people they

1253
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:58,320
represent and it certainly is important
the image

1254
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,660
I love US companies and the question of
whether people around the world can

1255
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,599
trust US companies with their data

1256
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,719
is very important it's something the FTC
is aware one last piece I would add to

1257
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:10,200
this

1258
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,889
is that the FTC as a law enforcement
agency

1259
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:17,520
is in the business have been forcing the
laws that Congress has given it

1260
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,790
on and so if something is illegal under
current law

1261
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:26,880
the FTC can bring an enforcement action
to stop it if something

1262
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,000
is undesirable but doesn't violate any
current law

1263
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,670
the FTC has does not have power to stop
that arm

1264
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:39,760
much love the job love the I've FTC
lawyers is to figure out

1265
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,860
how to use the authority that's been
granted

1266
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:47,030
on in ways that are consistent with the

1267
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:52,969
mom with good public policy but there
are certainly things that you wish you

1268
01:11:52,969 --> 01:11:53,750
could stop

1269
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,270
that any reasonable person would agree
should not be happening that

1270
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:01,560
fall into a gap in the law and I'm to
the extent that

1271
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,070
its a few US companies exploit those
things and give a bad image to the

1272
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,410
others I think that's a problem

1273
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:10,500
but that's a problem that can't be fixed
by the FTC by itself if you love you

1274
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,510
second very quick question yes I think
in in in

1275
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:16,780
my understanding is that in the US 50 CT
scare

1276
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:20,929
of aspect that in some European
countries is actually covered by

1277
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:24,170
two different institutions each other
what local FTC

1278
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:27,690
and the local data protection yes agency

1279
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:31,320
right yes that's right this if I refer
to the case of

1280
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,650
Switzerland France and Germany it is I
that you see

1281
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,710
these as a weakness in the case of the
European case

1282
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:42,020
or it does bring more independence
vis-a-vis the government

1283
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,360
or both arm so the question is whether
whether it's a good thing to have a

1284
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,080
separate Data Protection Authority

1285
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:51,269
as opposed to having it wrapped into the
general consumer protection portfolio

1286
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,180
as it is in the US on it's partly
historical accident I think in the US

1287
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,960
that things are

1288
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,620
shape this way mom and that given the
lack

1289
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:04,170
love a broad base line data privacy law
in the US

1290
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:07,790
mom data privacy enforcement has fallen
under

1291
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:11,160
language in the FTC Act which simply
forbids

1292
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,670
unfair or deceptive acts or practices
arm

1293
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:19,489
and am perhaps it might not be obvious

1294
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:23,968
in advance but a lotta love the privacy
law enforcement that needs to happen can

1295
01:13:23,969 --> 01:13:24,530
be fit

1296
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:29,330
within that that's what the FTC is done
um

1297
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:34,519
I do think it's a plus to treat privacy
as an aspect of consumer protection

1298
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,600
more broadly on and I do think it's a
plus

1299
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,780
actually and I also for I felt

1300
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,019
during my time at the FTC that the
breath

1301
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:48,630
the agency's job but its mission was
actually a plus

1302
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:51,770
because you didn't have these internal
boundaries

1303
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:55,330
that made it difficult to work together
mom

1304
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,180
you know it there's a saying that
software takes on the shape of the

1305
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,480
organization that doctor

1306
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,269
in the same is true of government
activity right if you draw a line in the

1307
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,110
org chart if you separate something into
a separate agency

1308
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,200
it becomes more difficult to coordinate
across that boundary and I think it's a

1309
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,150
plus within the FTC that

1310
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:14,230
that that those things together in the
FTC

1311
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:18,320
thank you on home in at general across
University

1312
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,019
so I wanted to ask you a little bit more
about the pipeline you there are a lotta

1313
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:22,350
love

1314
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:26,180
the US military turns out to be pretty
good about trying to pipe academics

1315
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:29,610
into helping them in working with them
to things like the defense science study

1316
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:30,130
group

1317
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,650
there's another computer science study
group is are like your long tours we

1318
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:35,549
spent a couple weeks a year

1319
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:40,460
you're looking at big guns and big ships
and getting briefings and things

1320
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,880
see a lot of work shirts do but other
parts the government don't seem to have

1321
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,219
that kind of pipeline

1322
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:50,230
there's no pipeline to give you a tour
of Congress and how the policy-making

1323
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:51,468
process works

1324
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:55,120
what can we do to help build the
pipeline to bring

1325
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,559
to cross the community lights %uh
there's a few things on one is there

1326
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,590
actually is something that he is

1327
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,850
I'm not as large as

1328
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:07,219
for for intensive as things like the
defense I and study group

1329
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:12,670
or 9 similar things the CCC the
computing community consortium

1330
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,520
runs this thing called lists be which
it's an acronym for something

1331
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,780
what it is is like a two day bootcamp on
how to you

1332
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,820
and on the government policy process and
how to work with that

1333
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:26,230
for computer scientists on and people
who are interested

1334
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:30,290
in getting more deeply into this stuff I
would recommend trying to

1335
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:35,560
pick up with that now other activities
come from within

1336
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,400
government and up the examples you gave
and that would be

1337
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,650
helpful there is a jot there is this
cultural issue of convincing particular

1338
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:44,750
agencies

1339
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:49,520
that they should care that day you know
there was a process to convince the

1340
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,710
chair the FTC that there should be a
chief technologist

1341
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:56,570
that it was worth spending a precious
staffs lot on their

1342
01:15:56,570 --> 01:16:00,360
and that this would be a person you
could talk to an actually get benefit

1343
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,030
from

1344
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:04,929
working with and that was a lobbying
process that started

1345
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:09,880
in 2000 eight or so and which bore fruit
in 2011

1346
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,860
with me actually being appointed to the
position arm

1347
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,030
it's been a slow process to convince
agencies that this

1348
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:21,790
is valuable um staffing is a zero-sum

1349
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,940
game and so by creating this position

1350
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:28,139
chairman Leibowitz had one fewer lawyer
working for him

1351
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,130
on you know now it seems like a no
brainer to say that when your ratio

1352
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,380
love lawyers to technologists is 250 21

1353
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,670
that may be having another technologist
might be a good idea um

1354
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:43,370
nonetheless on you know they know
exactly what that person is doing and

1355
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:47,269
nowadays staffing is a zero-sum a
negative some games so it's

1356
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:52,090
are justified it's a cultural change it
takes time to do it takes lobbying it

1357
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,450
took specific lobbying

1358
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:57,599
specific decision makers to get my
position created

1359
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,620
mom and it was done by people who had
connections to you

1360
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:06,380
to to those people

1361
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:10,440
you mentioned relevance summer

1362
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,540
seems word

1363
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,450
able you might have any predictions or
guesses about with the relevant serve

1364
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:21,410
security might be in so up I
particularly I'm

1365
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:25,219
I notice earlier this year was February

1366
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:28,440
it was a I believe it was a FTC a.m.

1367
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,490
consent decree against well HTC

1368
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,910
yeah listed a number of items but the
one did jump

1369
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:39,230
I thought was fascinating and there was
one at the account surcharges

1370
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:43,309
agence HTC was that they were the
security vulnerabilities

1371
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:47,100
in these free ship aP's and that the
failure to use reasonable appropriate

1372
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,480
security practices was a

1373
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:53,299
unfair yes practice which under FTC's
you know

1374
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,410
charter I guess a authority over unfair
deceptive

1375
01:17:56,410 --> 01:18:00,130
three packs so I was wondering if you
might have any thoughts about what

1376
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:03,690
relevance to security shock the well
certainly

1377
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:09,580
the FTC its by now well established that
they can do this that if a company

1378
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:14,550
fails to follow reasonable precautions
reasonable under the circumstances

1379
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:19,210
and as a result there is a breach and as
a result consumers are harmed

1380
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:23,250
then the FTC can probably bring a case

1381
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:26,500
arm and there are

1382
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,600
I there been quite a few of these the
HTC

1383
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,140
one is on I think important in the
development

1384
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,260
love this area for the FTC because

1385
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,430
it was in some respects I can say this
because

1386
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:43,650
on I wasn't there when it happened

1387
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:47,280
the it was in some respects you know a
more egregious set up security

1388
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,880
violations then some

1389
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,300
the other ones on and also because it
went to smartphones and that

1390
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,800
you know the on the FTC documents talked
about

1391
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,800
you know use terms like Unix domain
socket and so on

1392
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,510
right on that

1393
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:05,920
you know it seem to actually understand
what was some what was going on

1394
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,710
technically

1395
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:10,360
on this is an area that is important arm

1396
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,980
and the FTC's actually been doing this
for for for longer

1397
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:18,218
now that said um this is only a small
piece

1398
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:21,830
up the overall cybersecurity issue that
the government

1399
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:25,880
has to work with in one of the things I
thought tried to think a lot about why

1400
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,980
was there

1401
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,750
was weather made sense for how to get
the FTC more involved

1402
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:35,660
in arm in talking about security

1403
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,990
but the fact is given that cyber
security is such a big problem

1404
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:42,700
and the FTC has this one little piece
which is

1405
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,870
on essentially dealt with on I

1406
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:49,090
security breaches due to negligence by
companies

1407
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:52,630
that it was hard to make it a major

1408
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:57,780
thrust for the agency that might change

1409
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:01,050
act at this is however from NSF I

1410
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:04,430
greatly enjoyed your pocket you one

1411
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:08,140
most fitting to concentrate on having
academia affect policy

1412
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:11,250
more reactive way was one with any
comments but the OPs

1413
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:14,400
direction are there any active research
problems

1414
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,440
that up come out love what the FTC

1415
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,480
is experience he which the active he

1416
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,599
is where arm

1417
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,750
I think there probably are on

1418
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:31,440
certainly so for one thing there has
been

1419
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,049
I a pretty good literature in say the
law

1420
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,950
and on public policy world about

1421
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:43,410
talking about the affect actions by

1422
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:46,440
on the FTC in and and so on

1423
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,960
arm there

1424
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,190
and I know that there's been some
academic

1425
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:58,049
research that has been driven by

1426
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:02,230
serve what the legal boundaries are on

1427
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:05,879
research from

1428
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,080
it's hard to get it's a lil bit hard to
get specific

1429
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,719
arm the I think there are probably some
interesting

1430
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,740
quantitative studies to be done about
the effects have certain kinds

1431
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,429
actions by the agency mom

1432
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:25,969
um certainly I'm issues about the
effectiveness

1433
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:29,969
I love on love %uh initiatives that

1434
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:33,030
they're doing arm whether

1435
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:36,130
a certain changes in law are affect the

1436
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:39,219
behavior so for example there arm

1437
01:21:39,219 --> 01:21:42,469
is a change there there's been a rewrite

1438
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:46,260
the rule under the Children's Online
Privacy Protection

1439
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,950
Protection Act Coppa recently which
changes some other details

1440
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:55,340
love on how I third-party ads in webapps
for kids

1441
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,980
are supposed to work and

1442
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,820
there are opportunities to study the
impact on various kinds of practices and

1443
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,160
information flow

1444
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,860
appoint changes like that um a lot of
that may

1445
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,980
the question is you know and I don't
have a good answer for you just

1446
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:15,849
right off the top of my head is is there
research that requires

1447
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:19,160
you know real serious computer science
expertise

1448
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,530
that flows out of that and I'm not so
sure I I think there probably is

1449
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:28,290
arm but down but really much of what the
agency does

1450
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:31,550
is law enforcement in particular cases

1451
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:34,910
and the fact that for example so you
might look at something you know they've

1452
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:35,969
talked about the

1453
01:22:35,969 --> 01:22:39,350
am the case involving HTC on

1454
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:42,460
where the phone was shipped with all
kinds love

1455
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:47,650
pretty serious vulnerabilities on you
might look to see whether the

1456
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:51,910
on whether the level of security this
said Yvonne abilities are types of

1457
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:52,750
vulnerabilities

1458
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:57,200
on newly shipped phones have suddenly
got better as a result of that

1459
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,790
on that's one kind example you can look
at the effective government

1460
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,940
various a very section agency but the
FTC is a you know

1461
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:08,259
on the whole a relatively small agency
in much of what it does is sort of point

1462
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,040
law enforcement

1463
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:14,440
on so it may not offer the same

1464
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,759
range %uh research opportunities in
understanding the

1465
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,210
its impacts compared to you mom compared
to other agencies that do a lot more

1466
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:27,840
stuff

1467
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,490
Allan Sherman UMBC would you please give
a concrete example

1468
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:37,519
up how your Texan tactical advice help
shape policy

1469
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:44,520
sure on what see

1470
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,139
the its this a little bit tricky because

1471
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,010
you know that conversations that happen
within the agency are under the cone of

1472
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,160
silence

1473
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:59,840
arm I can't talk about a way in which

1474
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,520
I certainly there were um

1475
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,670
I can give you some types examples

1476
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:10,300
arm so there were cases involving

1477
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,790
um on data breaches our data security
cases

1478
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:18,239
on not the won the Dave talked about the
HTC case

1479
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:22,379
but other similar cases whether
questions about whether the

1480
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,360
I whether the

1481
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,259
on actress specific precautions taken by
a company were reasonable under the

1482
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,810
circumstances

1483
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:36,770
right was it unreasonable to protect
certain information in certain ways

1484
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:41,800
on was unreasonable to not do something
that you know we would recognize

1485
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,370
a particular thing we were recognized as
a best practice so on

1486
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:48,969
I was involved in helping me people make
decisions about

1487
01:24:48,969 --> 01:24:52,179
those sorts of things this particular
try to understand

1488
01:24:52,179 --> 01:24:56,690
you know what where do you have a very
strong case and where do you not

1489
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:59,820
um there were

1490
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,980
a lot of the cases that the FTC brings
are

1491
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,459
arm are resolved by settlement

1492
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,300
that means you have the settlement
document that's negotiated between the

1493
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,530
agency in between a company that has
violated the law

1494
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:17,610
on and um this often detail language in
there with car bout saying they can do

1495
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:19,450
this without but not the other

1496
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:24,349
on and arm of in the nuts and bolts of
how that stuff works

1497
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:27,400
is important to get right so that
there's not you don't leave a giant poop

1498
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,389
all but also you don't

1499
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:32,230
over constrain the company when it's not
needed for enforcement reasons

1500
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:36,150
on and I think at some specific examples
love above that

1501
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:39,250
um the

1502
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:44,640
um those are probably the best general
sort some examples I hesitate to give a

1503
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,360
specific example

1504
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,920
arm on in front v it's been fun every
quarter frankly

1505
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,540
um I given fat on a lot of this stuff

1506
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:58,719
is confidential and on of and what a fag
and might affect

1507
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,870
specific companies in specific ways but
certainly there

1508
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:05,790
are on a lot of ways in which

1509
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:10,230
the result love a specific result that
came out of an agency process

1510
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:14,660
on was different on actually let me give
you one more example

1511
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:18,830
on which had to do one more type which
had to do with

1512
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:23,280
I'm collection of evidence um some of
the cases many of the cases that the

1513
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,210
agency brings

1514
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:28,110
about internet scams collection
evidences super easy

1515
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:32,099
just like have to take a bunch of
screenshots of the fraudulent web pages

1516
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,820
um but some of the scams that go on a
more complicated involve more active

1517
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,330
exploitation by someone

1518
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:41,120
and the question of how you build an
evidence trail that would stand up in

1519
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:41,969
court

1520
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:45,320
on and how you do that in a way that
doesn't tip of the bad guy that you're

1521
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,160
I'm collecting evidence are you getting
actually some pretty interesting

1522
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,030
forensic

1523
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:53,800
on forensic issues and i did some arm
you know some real technical work

1524
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,120
arm actually building stuff to you

1525
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,980
to help with on collecting certain kinds
of evidence another example

1526
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:05,860
love the general assorted area where

1527
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:09,549
where I was able to contribute perhaps
you can

1528
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:14,570
get me to talk more specifically of of
record

1529
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:18,630
um so I see there's no one at the Mikes
and we've reached the end of the

1530
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:20,290
appointed time so thank you very much
