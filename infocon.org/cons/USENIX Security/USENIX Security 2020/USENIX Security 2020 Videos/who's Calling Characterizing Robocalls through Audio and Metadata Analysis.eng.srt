00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,440
hello everyone my name is satwik prasad

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,719
and i am a phd student at north carolina

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
state university

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,240
i'll be presenting our work on robocalls

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,080
titled who's calling

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,840
characterizing robocalls through audio

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,000
and metadata analysis

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
this is joint work with elijah burma

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,519
sims atisha kiran mylapan

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,279
and my advisor brad rives

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,199
robocalls are automated or

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,440
semi-automated phone calls that play a

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,440
recorded message once you answer them

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
i still remember the first robocall i

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,599
received within days of purchasing a new

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,199
phone number in the united states

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,879
the caller was trying to sell a car

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,320
insurance scheme when in fact i didn't

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
even own a car

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
even though most of these robocalls can

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,360
seem annoying

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,879
some robocalls can cause significant

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,559
harm to our society

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,079
robocallers are trying to sell fake

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,519
covet test kits

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
and health insurance schemes to

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,480
vulnerable population

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,518
in this long term study we provide

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,640
insights about the robocalling landscape

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,400
we answer four main questions the

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
frequent news reports and consumer

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
reports give us the impression that

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,600
robocalls are on the rise

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,320
we look at the data to understand if the

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,559
robocalling problem is getting worse

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,839
consumer reports constantly recommend

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
users to avoid

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
calls from unknown numbers to reduce the

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,400
number of robocalls you would receive

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,479
we conduct an experiment to understand

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
if answering robocalls results in more

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,679
robocalls

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,840
next we uncover robocalling operations

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,600
that were responsible for a large number

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
of these robocalls

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
and finally we study some of the tactics

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,960
used by robocallers to deceive their

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,960
victims

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
but to answer these important questions

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,559
we needed data

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,439
so we deployed a large-scale telephony

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
honeypot

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,158
the principle behind data collection in

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,119
our experiment was to own a large set of

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
phone numbers

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,960
and to wait for calls to be made to any

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
of these phone numbers

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,320
as consumers to our service provider we

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,479
obtained

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,440
more than 9000 phone numbers which had a

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,360
history of abuse

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,319
for example some of these phone numbers

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,879
were previously used by fraudsters

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,519
we used asterisk to deploy our telephony

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,920
honeypot

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
and configured our asterisk server to

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
reject all the calls made to these

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,920
numbers

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,200
we also collected zip logs and cdr

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,200
records for these calls

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
our honeypot constantly evolved

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,000
throughout our experiments and we added

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,079
more numbers

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
we account for these changes in all our

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
results and you can find those details

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,120
in our paper

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
next we randomly selected 3000 phone

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
numbers and configured our honeypot to

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,840
answer calls made to these numbers

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,839
we also recorded the call audio

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,800
further we added more than 57 000 phone

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,319
numbers which did not have a history of

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,239
abuse

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,079
we configured our honeypot to reject

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,879
calls made to these four numbers

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
finally we identified about 3000 phone

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,679
numbers which received a large number of

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,079
phone calls

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
and configured them to answer the phone

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
calls and record the call audio

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,080
to summarize over 11 months we used more

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,360
than 66 000 phone numbers

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,959
to collect about 150 000 call recordings

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,879
and a total of 1.5 million phone calls

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,560
a detailed discussion of ethical and

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,079
legal considerations of our work

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
can be found in our paper now let us

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
take a look at the data

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,359
that we collected over the 11 months

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,798
this graph shows the normalized call

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,720
volume observed in our honeypot

102
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,280
during the first few weeks we observed a

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,359
relatively constant call volume

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
but in the month of april we saw a

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
sudden increase in the number of calls

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,640
on deeper inspection we observed that

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
some phone numbers received a

108
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,238
disproportionately high number of phone

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,920
calls within a short span of time

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,080
we characterize these phenomena as

111
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,559
storms

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,480
further we added about 57 000 phone

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,080
numbers and continue to observe a

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,238
relatively constant call volume

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,478
when we observed the weekly call volume

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,478
throughout our experiment

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,240
we found that the number of unsolicited

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,880
phone calls received in our honeypot

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,120
neither decreased nor increased rather

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,680
it remained stationary

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
over 11 months we were able to uncover

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,960
about 650 storm events

123
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,198
across more than 200 phone numbers

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,440
we observed that over 90 percent of

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
these unsolicited phone calls were made

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,440
during weekdays

127
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280
and more than 80 during working hours we

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
saw that the call volume would increase

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,479
drastically during weekdays

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,880
and drop during weekends the takeaway

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,039
here

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,040
is robocalling is a huge problem in the

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
united states and there is no sign of

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
decline

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
next we looked at one of the most common

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,440
recommendations made to users by

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,440
consumer forums and news reports

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,360
users are recommended not to answer

139
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,160
calls from unknown numbers to reduce the

140
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,960
number of robocalls you would receive

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,120
we selected 3000 random phone numbers

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
and rejected all the calls made to these

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
numbers for six weeks

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,758
next we answered all calls made to these

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,840
3000 numbers for 6 more weeks

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,280
finally we computed the average call

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,039
volume over these two study periods

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
we wanted to answer the question does

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,199
answering an unsolicited phone call have

150
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
a significant effect on the number of

151
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,520
unsolicited phone calls you would

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
receive

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,560
surprisingly we found no evidence that

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
answering an unsolicited phone call

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
would result in an increase in the

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
number of phone calls you would receive

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,919
what this means is even though we

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,159
recommend users to be cautious when

159
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,080
answering calls from unknown numbers

160
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,000
answering a robocall does not

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,960
necessarily mean you will receive more

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,960
robocalls in the future

163
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,080
next we wanted to process the call

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,198
recordings we had collected

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120
our key insight here is that robocalling

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
operations tend to reuse the call

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,039
recording to generate these unsolicited

168
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,280
phone calls

169
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
based on this key insight we grouped

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,840
calls with similar audio

171
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,919
into broader robocalling campaigns to do

172
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,520
this we developed a five-stage audio

173
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,280
clustering pipeline

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,599
the first stage of the audio clustering

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
pipeline computes the amount of audio

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
present in a call recording

177
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,680
the second stage identifies those audio

178
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,799
recordings that have significant amount

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
of audio

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,639
the third stage generates fingerprints

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,800
for these audio recordings

182
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
the fourth stage builds a graph where

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
audio recordings that are similar are

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,039
connected using a graph edge

185
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,120
and finally the fifth stage identifies

186
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,120
connected components in this graph

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
to uncover operational robocalling

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
campaigns

189
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,599
we processed all the call recordings

190
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
collected in our honeypot

191
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,319
using this pipeline we were able to

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,960
uncover more than two and a half

193
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
thousand unique robocalling campaigns

194
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
by manual inspection of the top

195
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,319
campaigns we found that the tenth

196
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,479
largest campaign seen in our honeypot

197
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,840
was a large-scale social security fraud

198
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
campaign

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,318
the largest campaign seen in our

200
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,120
honeypot had over 6000 phone calls

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
interestingly only a few calls were made

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
from most of these campaigns

203
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,080
to our honeypot using audio similarity

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,240
to identify campaigns

205
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
allowed us to study campaign-specific

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
behavior which was previously impossible

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
to measure

208
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,039
now let us take a look at some of the

209
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
strategies used by these campaigns to

210
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,479
deceive victims

211
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,639
anecdotally we know that caller id

212
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,080
spoofing is a common strategy used by

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,919
robocallers

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,680
we found that robocalling campaigns

215
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,080
regularly spoof caller id

216
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,840
or change their calling numbers this is

217
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,479
a trivial strategy using which

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,758
robocallers can evade allow list or

219
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,080
linealist based

220
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
robocall mitigation techniques to

221
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,359
quantify this behavior

222
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
we define and compute source

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
distribution which is the ratio of

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,758
number of unique caller ids in a

225
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
campaign

226
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,000
to the campaign size we found that the

227
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,280
average source distribution

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,080
was about 84 but surprisingly the top

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
campaign

230
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,758
had a source distribution of about 100

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,159
which translates to a unique caller id

232
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
for every call among the 6000 calls we

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
found

234
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,000
in our honeypot we observed that some

235
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,840
campaigns

236
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
use more sophisticated spoofing

237
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,400
techniques like neighbour spoofing

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,640
where the caller id matches the first

239
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,478
six digits of your call number

240
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,240
this deceives the victim into believing

241
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,560
the call was originated

242
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
from their neighborhood we observed that

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,478
77 campaigns

244
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,040
used neighbour spoofing techniques where

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,040
14 of them used neighbour spoofing for

246
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,880
all the calls they generated through

247
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,719
anecdotal evidence we know that some

248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,959
robocalling campaigns

249
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
randomly generate calls while others

250
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,518
used a specific list of phone numbers

251
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
we observed that robocalling campaigns

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,120
are highly targeted

253
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,399
and a top few campaigns seen in our

254
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,040
honeypot targeted specific phone numbers

255
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,040
to quantify this behavior we computed

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,399
spread which is the ratio of unique

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,199
destination numbers to the campaign size

258
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,240
we observed an average spread of 78 but

259
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
interestingly

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
the largest campaign had a spread of

261
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
just under 20

262
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,240
which translates to about five calls

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,399
made to the same phone number

264
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,760
while manually inspecting the top

265
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
robocalling campaigns

266
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,240
uncovered in our honeypot we encountered

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
two classes of fraudulent robocalling

268
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
campaigns

269
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,359
the first class of campaigns were the

270
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,839
social security fraud campaigns

271
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
we were able to uncover two distinct

272
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
social security fraud campaigns

273
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,880
where the caller was impersonating

274
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,800
federal agencies in the united states

275
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,360
we observed that these campaigns used

276
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,000
toll-free numbers to spoof caller id

277
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
the second campaign we encountered was a

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,800
fraudulent campaign

279
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
operating in mandarin or chinese

280
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,079
this campaign was impersonating the

281
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,680
chinese consulate

282
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,160
and was clearly targeting the

283
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,479
mandarin-speaking population

284
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,719
we observed that adversarial campaigns

285
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,839
impersonated government agencies

286
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,399
to deceive their victims apart from the

287
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,320
findings presented in this talk

288
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,640
we discussed many other interesting

289
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
findings in our paper

290
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,120
to conclude the key takeaway from this

291
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
talk is that robocalling is a huge

292
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
problem in the united states

293
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
and we desperately need solutions to

294
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,640
tackle them

295
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
even though we suggest users to be

296
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
cautious when answering calls from

297
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360
unknown numbers

298
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,120
answering a robocall does not

299
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
necessarily increase the number of

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,600
robocalls you would receive

301
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
next we found that illegal robocalls are

302
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
highly targeted

303
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,240
and regularly spoof their caller id

304
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
finally we uncovered fraudulent

305
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,760
robocalling campaigns

306
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,120
that target specific vulnerable

307
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,839
populations of our society

308
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
thank you

309
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
you
