00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,080
hello everyone i am anamador shiborwa

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,000
from uc irvine

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,679
today i am going to present an

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,480
interesting attack on grid tertiary

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,960
inverter

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,039
the name of our work is holy spoofing

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
and non-invasive dos attack on grid test

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,000
solar inverter

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
as you all know the solar inverter

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,880
market is growing rapidly

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,039
and it has been anticipated that within

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,599
2028 the market size will be 35 million

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,599
usd

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
the presence of all sensor is pervasive

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
in greater solar inverter

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
the main reason for that all sensors

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,719
have small form factor

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,760
they're efficient and they have low

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
measurement error

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,920
but this whole sensor can be perturbed

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,399
by injecting external magnetic field

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
by the attacker this type of attack is

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,480
explained

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,399
in this world the main technical

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,640
contributions of our work

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
are we have proposed a new attack model

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
on the house sensor

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,199
we have developed algorithms and an

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
attack tool to make this attack

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,640
possible we have validated our attack in

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
a test bed

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
which is a scaled down version of a

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,720
power grid we have also evaluated our

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,920
attack model in a medium size 2.3

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,560
megawatt

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,360
power grid by our industry used software

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
etap

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,320
and at last we have also proposed

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,080
counter measures against this attack

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,839
before going to explain our main attack

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,880
model i would like to explain hall

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
sensor basics

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
at the heart of the hall sensor there is

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
a hall element

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
this hall element will generate a

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
voltage v hall

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
if it can sense a magnetic field b the

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
amount of voltage we haul

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
that is going to be generated by

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
following this equation

51
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
if you can see this equation the

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
relation between v hall

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
and b is linear the attacker can perturb

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,360
this magnetic field b

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,960
to change the developed voltage v hall

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,799
now i am going to explain the attack

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
model the attacker could be a

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,840
disgruntled employee

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,919
a visitor or data could be an

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
introduction the attacker

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,800
will place his attack tool inside a

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
flower vase or coffee cup to camouflage

63
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
to it

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
the attacker then placed his camouflage

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
attack tool

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,160
near a greater solar inverter and inject

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
sinusoidal

68
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
square or constant magnetic pulse into

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
the greater inverter

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
this will create haphazard in great

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
synchronization

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,520
and this will also inject false real and

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
reactive power into the grid

74
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,360
as the attack tool or the embedded

75
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,000
holospoofing controller has zigbee

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,239
module

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the attacker can control it remotely

78
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,760
which can disconnect the microgrid

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
which can also randomly shut down the

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
grid which can cause blackout and which

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,239
can also cause

82
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,560
company loss now i am going to

83
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
explain the attack tool which is named

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,319
as the embedded holospoofing controller

85
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
at the center of this attack tool there

86
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
is the electromagnet this electromagnet

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,000
is controlled by a mosfet

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,239
this mosfet is controlled by an arduino

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,879
uno this rdn owner is connected with a

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
zigbee

91
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,440
for remote control this attack tool can

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,000
be placed in a container here we

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
consider

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
a flower vase as a container and

95
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,518
camouflage it

96
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,359
we can the attacker can place this

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
camouflage attack tool near the solar

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
inverter

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
to perturb it now i am going to explain

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,200
how the attack propagates from the house

101
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
sensor to the inverter controller

102
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,238
there are three locations where health

103
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
sensors are present inside the solar

104
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,959
inverter

105
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,280
one location is close to the solar panel

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
this is known as solar

107
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,720
hall sensors and other two locations are

108
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
close to the grid

109
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
these are known as the grid sensors if

110
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
the attacker

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,319
attacks the solar panel sensor the

112
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,440
attacks propagates to the mppt block

113
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,359
as the mppt block has no low pass filter

114
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
the attack further propagates to the pi

115
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
controller from the pi controller the

116
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
attacker

117
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
the attack further propagates to the pwm

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
inverter and the inverter generates

119
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,120
false voltage and frequency

120
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,958
if the attacker attacks the grid sensors

121
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
for example the whole current sensor

122
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
the injected attack propagates from

123
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,920
whole current sensor to the abc to dq

124
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,439
transformation block

125
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,599
and if the attacker attacks the whole

126
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,000
voltage sensor or the whole grid sensors

127
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,040
the attack further propagates to the pll

128
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
pll

129
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
is responsible for grid synchronization

130
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
so if the attacker can

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,320
attack the pll the inverter loses its

132
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
synchronization with the grid

133
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
now i am going to explain the

134
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
experimental setup

135
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,919
we have used a gridted solar inverter

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,960
from texas instrument with a steel

137
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,198
shield

138
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
in our experimental setup we have placed

139
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
our attack tool eight centimeter away

140
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,159
from the inverter and we have also

141
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,159
varied the distance

142
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
we have used dc voltage source as a

143
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,320
solar panel emulator

144
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
we have used small scale grid load and a

145
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,719
power inverter to

146
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
emulate our power grid now i am going to

147
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
explain

148
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,599
how the whole spoofing is going to

149
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
impact the griptide inverter voltage

150
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
two types of magnetic field the attacker

151
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
can inject

152
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
one types of magnetic field can align

153
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
with the vertical magnetic field of

154
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,199
current this is known as the plus mm

155
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,599
spoofing

156
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,440
and the other type of magnetic field can

157
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,919
oppose the vertical magnetic field

158
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,479
this is known as the minus mm spoofing

159
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,560
by using the plus mmf spoofing

160
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,639
the attacker can increase the grid

161
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,320
voltage from 110 volt

162
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,880
to 39.4 volt variation by using

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,000
a minus mm spoofing the attacker can

164
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,039
reduce the voltage by 39.4 volt

165
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,960
from the nominal voltage of 120 volt

166
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,719
now i am going to explain how the whole

167
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,799
spoofing is going to impact the

168
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
retained inverter frequency if the

169
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,039
attacker injects

170
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,000
one hertz square pulsating wave into the

171
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,880
whole sensor of the solar inverter the

172
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,639
output voltage is out of phase

173
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
if the attacker increase the frequency

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
from 1 hertz to 2 hertz

175
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,240
the output voltage is completely

176
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,680
distorted this distortion

177
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,759
will shut the inverter down

178
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
now i am going to explain how a hollow

179
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,919
spoofing attack

180
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
impact with the spoofing distance here

181
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,318
spoofing distance defines as the

182
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
distance

183
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
between the whole sensor and the attack

184
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
tool if the attacker targets the grid

185
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
sensor

186
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,560
and place it less than seven centimeter

187
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,639
close to the hole to the

188
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,639
uh greater solar inverter the attacker

189
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,479
can shut down the inverter

190
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,160
if the attacker targets the solar panel

191
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,599
sensor and place it less than one

192
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,919
centimeter close to the

193
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
solar inverter the attacker can also

194
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,198
shut down the inverter

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
except this two region in the other

196
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,360
region the voltage variation frequency

197
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,758
and real power variation

198
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
varies in polynomial fashion with a

199
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,000
spoofing distance

200
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,440
now i am going to explain the attack

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
impact with spoofing power

202
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,520
here spoofing power defines as the input

203
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,239
power to the electromagnet

204
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
if the attacker targets the grid sensor

205
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
and inject plus mm spoofing

206
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,719
he can shut down the inverter by

207
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
injecting more than 32 watt power into

208
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,120
the electromagnet

209
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,679
if the attacker targets the solar panel

210
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
sensor

211
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,039
he can do adversarial control over the

212
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,119
output real power

213
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,199
by varying the input power to the

214
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
electromagnet from 0 watt to

215
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,840
50 watt

216
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
previously we have demonstrated our

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
attack model in a small scaled

218
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,758
lab setup but to show the

219
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
complication of this attack we have

220
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,440
modeled

221
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
a large practical grid by using ieee 13

222
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
bus model

223
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,758
in this model there are different

224
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,318
generators

225
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
with different ranges the attacker

226
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
targets

227
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,880
this 100 kilowatt inverter now we are

228
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,240
going to show

229
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,960
how this attack will cause catastrophic

230
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
damage

231
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
to this practical grid

232
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,719
if the attacker attacks the grid sensors

233
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,799
he can cause

234
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,759
grease internal synchronization attack

235
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,840
for example

236
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
if attack happens at two second time

237
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
step after that time

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
the grid frequency and voltage decays

239
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,840
continuously

240
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,919
which will lead to a great blackout this

241
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,878
grid breakout is only possible if the

242
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,758
grid is weak

243
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,639
here we grid means whose voltage and

244
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
frequency

245
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
varies significantly with the change of

246
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,479
load

247
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
the attacker can inject false real and

248
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,919
reactive power

249
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,280
into the grid if the attack happens at

250
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,000
two second time step

251
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,799
and the attacker injects a false real

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,120
power

253
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
the grid frequency level falls to 68

254
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
percent of the rated frequency

255
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,680
after two second if the attacker

256
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,520
injects false reactive power into the

257
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,560
grid the grid voltage level

258
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,760
falls to 15 percent of the rated voltage

259
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,080
so in our attack model the attacker

260
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,039
can change the grid voltage and

261
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
frequency

262
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,838
by using false real and reactive power

263
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,599
injection

264
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
we have already demonstrated and

265
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,600
explained our attack model

266
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,120
on on a practical grid now we are going

267
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,480
to explain the counter measures the

268
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
first counter measure

269
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
could be is to use a guard sensor to

270
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
sense the presence of external magnetic

271
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
field

272
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,640
the second counter measure is to ensure

273
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,479
a secure sounding environment

274
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
around the solar inverter the third

275
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,040
counter measure to

276
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,959
use ferromagnetic alloy material

277
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
as a shield the ferromagnetic alloy

278
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,040
material could be kinetica natick s36 or

279
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,120
the move metal

280
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
the fourth or and the last counter

281
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
measure could be used differential hall

282
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,920
effect sensor

283
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,000
differential hall effect sensor can

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
reject common mode external magnetic

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,880
field

286
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,519
and it is robust to external magnetic

287
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,680
field

288
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,959
presence now we are going to demonstrate

289
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,839
our attack model in a video for a better

290
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,839
understanding

291
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,839
to the reader

292
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,080
so before the attack the solo inverter

293
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,279
is stable

294
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,399
you can see the dc power source which

295
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,439
emulates

296
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,440
the solar panel

297
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,000
you can see the solar inverter

298
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
inside the steel shield and you can see

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
the voltage and current

300
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,760
which are all stable before there is no

301
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:19,360
attack happens

302
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:22,959
the output voltage is also stable

303
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,920
now the attacker is going to place

304
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:33,439
his camouflaged attack tool near the

305
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:38,079
gritted solar inverter

306
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,079
here we use a coffee cup as a container

307
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,360
later at a remote location the attacker

308
00:10:46,800 --> 00:11:00,640
activates his attack tool by using

309
00:10:49,360 --> 00:11:02,720
remote control

310
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
the attack tool starts injecting

311
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
magnetic field

312
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
into the solar inverter

313
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,880
as a result as you can see the output

314
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,839
voltage

315
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,839
and current are not stable anymore

316
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,640
the output voltage is also fluctuating

317
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
before going to finish the presentation

318
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,519
i want to give a summary

319
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,480
of our work we have demonstrated a new

320
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
attack model

321
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
on us the solar inverter of the gridtech

322
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,399
inverter

323
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
we have developed algorithms and attack

324
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,079
tool

325
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,720
to make this attack feasible we have

326
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,638
validated and evaluated our attack

327
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,200
in two different platforms

328
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
so this is our end thank you for your

329
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,160
attention

330
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:08,240
please let me know if you have any

331
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:08,240
further questions
