00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,959
hello everybody

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,719
welcome to my talk my name is yuzhang

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,080
in this talk i'll introduce the

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,279
downgraded attacks against

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,759
bluetooth low energy this is a joint

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,880
work

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,400
with five universities

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,479
so what is the ble or what is the

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,679
bluetooth low energy

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,440
so ble is the first generation of the

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,320
blue tools

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,800
when compared with the bluetooth classic

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,520
it has multiple other waste features

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,239
such as low power consumption large

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
coverage

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,760
added to introduce the attribute

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,360
protocol

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,079
known as the atd protocol the idt

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
protocol

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,760
groups all the data in a format or

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,399
attributes

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
and allows our smartphone to work with a

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
ble device

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
in a client and a server mode like what

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
happened

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,040
in a tcp ip communication

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
due to the use of central client and the

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
server mode

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,119
our smartphone can now communicate with

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,479
all case or iot device

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,280
such as smart watches smart locks smart

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,520
plugs

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,880
and smart lights in a traditional client

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,240
and the through mode in tcp

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:34,479
client and the server may use tcl

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:37,759
tls ssl to secure the communication

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,720
in ble 2ble device

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,880
relies on parent process for its

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,640
security

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,759
we know that tls ssl can achieve

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,119
mutual application but how about net in

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,600
ble

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,159
kle also achieving a mutual application

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,199
okay let's look at the workflow on the

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,240
parent process

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,200
and find out this is

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,158
the workflow or the ble pairing

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
initially

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
a app on the mobile have to start an

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,359
appearance process

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
afterwards two devices exchange the

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,520
parent process

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,319
which indicates what type of pair method

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,280
the two device supports

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,238
name the mobile and the device determine

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
a

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,040
suitable parent method first order

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
exchange the

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,840
parent features there are four parent

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,319
methods are available

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
just works past key entry numeric

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,599
compression

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,120
and auto guard two device starts to

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,799
distribute keys after that multiple keys

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,840
can be distributed such as the

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,959
identity resolution key known as the

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,239
ark the ark can be used to

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,640
uniquely identify the activities of the

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,280
parent devices

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,799
finally the tool device starts to use

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,599
the generated case

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,400
to encrypt and link and communicating

73
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,720
with each other

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
reconnect there are four pairing methods

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,000
are available

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,200
and ple also specify as security levels

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,799
for the pairing method

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,679
among them just walks and plantings are

79
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
not secure

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,640
since there is no authentication process

81
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,720
is involved

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,679
positive entry and the numeral

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,239
compression

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,720
are secure and have a higher security

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,720
levels

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,640
ble also specified in the strongest

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,760
security levels

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
from the ble devices under the secure

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,040
connections only mode

90
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,399
on the ico mode well device

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,640
in a still mode the device must

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
use the pascal entry or numeric

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,599
comparison

94
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,599
to a sticker the mobile

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,879
our observation is that according to ble

96
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,679
specification

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,640
the excel mode is only enforced in the

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,079
direct state

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,199
which provides the services but

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,079
it's not the enforced ethnic initiative

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,960
which consume the data services and as a

102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,880
result

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,039
multiple flaws can be derived

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,919
with the secure connection only mode

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,199
enabled

106
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,440
the device requires a pass king entry

107
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,479
or numeric comparison to a sticker in

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
the mobile

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,960
and should i reject an insecure

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,400
connection initiated by a

111
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,840
malicious mobile okay

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,880
but uh this mode is not enforced

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,198
for a mobile suitable bio

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
is not enforced to a sticker to the

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,560
device side meaning that

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,280
mobile can accept insecure parent

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
methods

118
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,440
initiated by a malicious device

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,880
we further propose the four capabilities

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,039
for our initiator

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:15,280
like a mobile to enable such iso mode

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:18,800
our our idea is that the os should have

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,758
the capability to allow a app to specify

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,240
and enforce the secure pairing method

125
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
since

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,720
the app is designed for the

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,360
device and an app should know

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
if the device supports the secure parent

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,919
method

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,400
or not by saying that we mean

131
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,359
initially the app should have the

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
capability

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,039
to specify the secure pairing method

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,280
indicate the app really needs secure

135
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,320
parent message

136
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
we'll determine the pairing method the

137
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,000
os

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,198
should enforce the secure parameter

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,880
if the app requires security and

140
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,319
notify the app over the result

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,120
errors may occur if errors

142
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
occur the os should they lighten the app

143
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,000
to handle those arrows

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
and in the app my furnace determined if

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,440
it

146
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,479
still was to secure an apparent process

147
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,280
or still wants to continue

148
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:25,400
continuing communication process

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,799
case can be broken due to the

150
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,599
misconfiguration

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,039
or some kind of attacks the app should

152
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
have the capability

153
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,199
to remove a broken key so as to start a

154
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
new

155
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,080
parent process

156
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:46,000
if the four capabilities are not enabled

157
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,280
os have to handle the parent process in

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
a compatible way

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,520
without enforcing the secure parent

160
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,639
method

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
however lack of default capability is

162
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,080
the broadcast

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,520
of the downgrade attacks for example

164
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,000
in our attack effect device can pretend

165
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,080
to be the real device

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,199
and the sata os arrow code

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,400
telling the os that it does not have the

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,759
encryption key when the os

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,758
receive the error code

170
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,599
it it does not have the capability to

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,198
notify an app so as a result

172
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,560
the os and the device

173
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,560
communicate with each other in platex

174
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,840
without it without enforcing

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
the secure pairing meaning that there is

176
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,239
no

177
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,280
authentication is involved during the

178
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,639
communication

179
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,039
in such a way a attacker can go around

180
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,840
the actification process and an

181
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
encryption

182
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,840
process as well we now

183
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
further look at the workflow on the

184
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,520
downgrade attacks

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,359
we assume that before our attack the

186
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
mobile and on the device

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
have been paired with the secure

188
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,080
parameters such as

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,080
pascal entry and the numeric compressor

190
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,199
effect device pretends to be an

191
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
environment device

192
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,319
at leveraging the fourth laws discussed

193
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,919
earlier

194
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,479
as a result the os does not notify the

195
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,680
app

196
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,878
arrows but accept the insecure

197
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,039
connection

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,080
the mobile and an effect device

199
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,279
communicate

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,399
implactex without any

201
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,760
like astication or encryption

202
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,958
infect device can now inject any data

203
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,120
to the victim mobile and steal

204
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,479
system information from the victim

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
mobile

206
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
in the next step effects that affect

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
device

208
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,519
steals mobile's irk and

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,640
use the irky to create a fake mobile

210
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,959
deploy our toilets are beyond

211
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,000
the mobile the secure parent methods

212
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,079
are downgraded to insecure ones because

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,040
of the fourth laws

214
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,120
so we named our attacks as the downgrade

215
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,920
attacks

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,320
here are eight attacks we identified

217
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
four of them against the initiators such

218
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,360
as mobile

219
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,800
and the other four against the peer

220
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,760
device

221
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,120
we now discuss the device based on the

222
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,600
previous discussion

223
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,000
we know that attacks are caused by the

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,120
lack of the capabilities on the mobile

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,839
set no so we

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,800
enable the four capabilities so as to

227
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
pitch the flaws

228
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,519
for example we enable the capabilities

229
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,720
for apps to handle the errors

230
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,240
when error occurs the app can decide

231
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,680
if it still needs the secure pairing

232
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,320
we now look at the evaluation okay

233
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,599
we first evaluate our attacks on

234
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,360
multiple

235
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,800
oasis including android ios mac os

236
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,160
windows and linux all of those

237
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,479
os subjects are subject to our text

238
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,240
for example we test our attacks or

239
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,839
different versions of android

240
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,320
and none of them are secure as a result

241
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,959
most of the manufacturers hatch the

242
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
floss

243
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,680
accordingly since the attacks go

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,040
beyond the mobile we also test them on

245
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,439
multiple real devices and

246
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,360
all of those devices are subject to our

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,640
attacks

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,279
we build a keystroke handling hacking

249
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,800
tool

250
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,600
against the ble keyboards

251
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
moreover our experiment indicates that

252
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,279
attacking distance

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,279
reaches more than 19 meters

254
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,719
attacker may have a competition with the

255
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,320
victim mobile

256
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,440
in connecting device

257
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,160
in our other experiment

258
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,600
we show that with a higher addressing

259
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,079
frequency

260
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,120
an attacker can have a better chance to

261
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,640
deploy

262
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,680
attacks we also evaluate the device

263
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,880
or iosp and the result shows that

264
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,000
it has a very small footprint

265
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,000
we now conclude our talk in this talk we

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
introduced the language attacks the

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
cause of the attack

268
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,640
is that there is no iso mode enabled at

269
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,480
the

270
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,160
s net initiator set regarding this

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,360
there are four capabilities are required

272
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,240
our conclusion is that seo mode must be

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,560
enforced at

274
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
both sides so as to achieve the

275
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,359
strongest

276
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:58,959
security we validate our attacks

277
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:02,959
or multiple os and many real devices

278
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,959
thank you very much for your valuable

279
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,440
time

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
you
