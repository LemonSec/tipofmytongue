00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
hi my name is jay greyshell

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,920
i'm going to be presenting today on

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
understanding south african mobile users

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
perceptions of privacy

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,760
and privacy related behaviors on the

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,640
facebook suite of applications

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,039
let's begin with an understanding of why

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
studying users in resource constrained

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
settings is important

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
nowadays there seems to constantly be

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,558
massive data breaches

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
privacy scandals on social media whether

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,440
that be facebook or google plus

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,040
but privacy issues are important to all

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
people regardless of where they come

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,480
from

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,360
social media usage and device ownership

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,160
has been rising

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,320
in emerging markets but most studies on

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,519
user privacy have been conducted on

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,879
resource-rich

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
nations on student populations and few

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
studies have been done

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,640
in resource poor settings and most of

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,919
those have focused only on the facebook

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
app itself

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
from existing studies we don't have

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,960
enough insights

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,158
to cater to the needs of resource

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,479
constrained users

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,159
so our goal is to provide that insight

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,600
as costly data plans

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,360
phone sharing or other cultural

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,158
differences could inform their privacy

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
models

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,000
we chose to focus on south africa as 89

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,479
of social media users there do so

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
exclusively from their mobile devices

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,080
we wanted to understand how low-income

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,080
mobile users

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,520
perceive and manage their privacy on

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,240
social media

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,079
in a resource-constrained setting and we

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,320
wanted to make recommendations

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,960
for the design of the privacy settings

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,320
and controls on these platforms

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,720
with resource-constrained users in mind

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,639
to recruit users for our study we used

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
three different methods we used online

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
targeted advertisements

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,839
twitter and we also used the help of a

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,640
research assistant in cape town south

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,399
africa

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,799
then administered to each of the people

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,079
who volunteered a demographic and social

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,840
media usage survey

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,439
to ensure that every individual was

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
above the age of 18

59
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,199
and used social media for at least two

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
hours a day to ensure that we could

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,239
separate novice users

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,200
for more regular users who we could

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,120
interview about their privacy needs

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,519
i conducted the first set of interviews

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
on site in research ict africa's

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040

in which i conducted these interviews

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
and we also recruited individuals from

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
many of the places pictured in these

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,238

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
these interviews took place

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,040
each of the interviews lasted about an

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,679
hour long i conducted the first 15

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
interviews

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
over the series of three weeks in

86
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
december of 2018

remaining 37

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
over the following three months in her

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
office

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,560
with the first series of interviews

93
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
informing the questions that we asked in

94
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,400
the second set

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,399
which included uh is there anything you

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
avoid doing on social media

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,319
what or why have you thought about who

98
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
can see what you're sharing on social

99
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,640
media

100
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
and are you aware of any privacy

101
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,599
settings in the social media

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,518
applications that you use

103
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,480
compensation to each of our participants

104
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
was provided in form of a gift card to

105
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,359
takealot.com

106
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
which is the south african version of

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
amazon effectively

108
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
and each of the interviews were

109
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,879
translated if needed transcribed then

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,200
underwent two rounds of qualitative data

111
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,359
coding and data analysis

112
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,359
our participants tended to skew towards

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
the younger side as can be expected in a

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
social media

115
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,360
study with most of them being between

116
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,599
the ages of 18

117
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,239
and 25 and 26 to 34

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,359
the self-reported income levels of the

119
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
individuals

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
tended to be towards the very low income

121
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
or low income

122
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
side of the spectrum with nine of them

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
choosing not to disclose

124
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,159
their individual incomes and the gender

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,599
breakdown was approximately 50 50

126
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,079
between male and female

127
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,039
with one individual identifying as

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,440
non-binary or other

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,199
i will now focus on a subset of the

130
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
findings from our study

131
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
firstly individuals we interviewed were

132
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
mostly concerned

133
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
with who could see their information

134
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
that is

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,440
other individuals not advertisers or the

136
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,440
platform itself

137
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
additionally there was a major lack of

138
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
awareness by our participants

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,000
of existing privacy settings on the

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,080
social media applications

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
and lastly we noted that our

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,400
participants physical safety

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,680
heavily influenced their social media

144
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,280
privacy models

145
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,919
as well as their privacy related

146
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,799
behaviors on these applications

147
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,680
so firstly regarding who could see what

148
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,919
there was not a

149
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
single mention by any of our

150
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,520
interviewees

151
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,639
of the notion of privacy from the

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,039
provider whether that be

153
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,600
advertisers or cookies or other forms of

154
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,159
tracking on the web

155
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
to them privacy was mostly about

156
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,360
information control

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
for example participant 35 described a

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
new girlfriend

159
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
looking at old pictures of his on

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,199
facebook as a

161
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
breach of privacy due to high data costs

162
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
in south africa

163
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
many individuals share their phones with

164
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
other people in their household

165
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
this led to major privacy violations

166
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,919
that came from

167
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,520
sharing that device participant 3

168
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,359
described that his girlfriend

169
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
changed his password accessed his

170
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
facebook and read his messages

171
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,639
because they were sharing the same phone

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,800
additionally it is culturally important

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,880
to maintain respect for the elders in

174
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
the household so their presentation of

175
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
themselves to their community heavily

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,199
influenced their behavior on social

177
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,919
media

178
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
as participant 18 described they had too

179
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,599
much respect for their elders

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
so they didn't want their elders to see

181
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
pictures of them with their boyfriend on

182
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,599
social media

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,600
the next finding that i want to focus on

184
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
is the lack of knowledge of the privacy

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,039
settings by many of the participants

186
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
58 of our participants either did not

187
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,719
know of

188
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,039
or how to use the privacy settings

189
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
this led to a surprisingly heavy

190
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
reliance

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,400
on the blocking feature an

192
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,400
all-or-nothing approach to privacy

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,840
in which they would shut out all people

194
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,960
who they may not want to see

195
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,280
any of their posts additionally high

196
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,680
data costs limited the ability of our

197
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,198
users to change the settings

198
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
as they did not want to spend their

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,160
precious data looking through the

200
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
settings

201
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,960
for things they might want to alter this

202
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
led towards very favorable reviews of

203
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,719
whatsapp versus facebook

204
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
where on whatsapp it took only two

205
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
clicks to get to the same privacy

206
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,199
features

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
that it took four clicks to get to on

208
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,880
facebook

209
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,880
the last finding that i want to focus on

210
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,840
is the physical safety influence on our

211
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,599
participants social media behaviors

212
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
in south africa there is a high crime

213
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
rate due to income disparity and phone

214
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,039
theft there is rampant

215
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840
so social media was used by many of our

216
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,159
participants as a data storage platform

217
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,198
where they'd upload their photos to a

218
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,000
platform like facebook or instagram to

219
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
make sure that

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
even after their phone has been stolen

221
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,039
they would still have access to their

222
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,880
pictures

223
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,520
additionally concerns for their physical

224
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,479
safety shaped our participants behavior

225
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,159
online

226
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,318
out of fear they might give away their

227
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,840
location or let people know they were

228
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
away from their home and it could be

229
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,239
robbed

230
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
individuals delayed posting until they

231
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
got home

232
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,878
they also heard of their friends being

233
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,000
lured with fake job opportunities

234
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,919
and then being kidnapped or much worse

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
so based on these findings we make a

236
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,080
series of recommendations to the

237
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,800
developers of these applications

238
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
firstly people were concerned with who

239
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
could see their information

240
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,800
so we want to add simple privacy

241
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,039
settings to these applications

242
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
we want to implement a post-level

243
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,639
audience setting on instagram

244
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
and whatsapp which are not currently

245
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,639
available that way each time a post is

246
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
made you can choose who

247
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,840
sees that to combat the lack of

248
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,759
knowledge by many of our participants

249
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
of these settings we want to make the

250
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,800
settings much more accessible

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
when you log on or you make an account

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
we can have something pop

253
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,679
up that says quickly review some

254
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,319
important settings

255
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,919
further we want to challenge the always

256
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,240
online assumptions

257
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
of social media applications we want to

258
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
bring the settings

259
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
forward on the applications so that

260
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,360
instead of taking

261
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,279
four clicks for example to get to the

262
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,760
privacy settings it may only take

263
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,200
two in areas with high data costs that

264
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
could mean the difference between

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
changing these settings

266
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,959
and not and further we want to make the

267
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,200
settings configurable offline that way

268
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,560
it doesn't require any data at all

269
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,959
to be able to manage your privacy

270
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,119
another recommendation that we had is to

271
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,680
improve the data compartmentalization

272
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,600
on these devices so that if multiple

273
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
people are using the same device

274
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
they don't have to have extra concerns

275
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
about their privacy

276
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
and lastly with regards to people's

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
physical safety

278
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,480
we want to accommodate for usage in high

279
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,080
crime areas

280
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
we want to make an alternative to

281
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
real-time posting currently blogs and

282
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,959
email

283
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
allow you to be able to schedule a post

284
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,880
for later we want a similar feature

285
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,120
for social media applications and lastly

286
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,000
email currently has the ability to let

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
you know

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
if you tried to attach something by

289
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,319
saying the word see attached but did not

290
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,720
attach something to the email

291
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,880
we want similar alerts for social media

292
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,399
whereby if you are posting identifying

293
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
information about yourself

294
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,519
it will alert you and make sure that you

295
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,000
did intend to post that

296
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,760
to summarize we found that our users

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,079
were primarily concerned with who could

298
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
see

299
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,439
what additionally they were unaware

300
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,120
of many of the existing controls and

301
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
settings on the platforms

302
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,399
and could not access them due to high

303
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,040
data costs

304
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
and lastly their physical safety heavily

305
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
factored into their

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
privacy models on social media based on

307
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,518
that

308
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,279
we recommended to make the settings more

309
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,000
accessible both online

310
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,000
and offline we wanted to improve the

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,880
data compartmentalization on those

312
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
devices

313
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,399
to enable easier phone sharing and

314
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
lastly

315
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,839
we wanted to make sure that we are

316
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,079
accommodating for areas of high

317
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,440
crime when we make social media

318
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,839
applications

319
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,959
with that in mind i'd like to thank all

320
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,800
of you for your time

321
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,119
i hope you guys learned something today

322
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,000
and i'd like to open it at this point

323
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,000
to any questions that you may have thank

324
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
you

325
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
you
