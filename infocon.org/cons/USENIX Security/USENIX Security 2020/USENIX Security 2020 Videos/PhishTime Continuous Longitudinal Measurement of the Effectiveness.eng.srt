00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,360
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,280
today i'm very excited to be presenting

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,440
fish time our framework on the

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,720
continuous longitudinal measurement

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,119
of the effectiveness of anti-fishing

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
blacklists my name is adam ost

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
and this is joint work together with my

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
co-authors at arizona state university

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,359
and paypal

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,598
as you may know phishing attacks use

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,238
social engineering to trick users

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,520
through malicious websites or messages

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,519
although these may seem trivial on the

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,239
surface they occur at scale

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
and cause real-world damage for example

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,279
earlier this year

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,840
we saw a surge in phishing related to

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,680
the coronavirus pandemic

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
an example of a phishing website which

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,160
impersonates a cdc donation campaign to

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
respond to the coronavirus

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,279
victims who visit this website might

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
think they're making a donation

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,399
when in fact they not only submit their

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,000
financial information

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
but also their identities to fraudsters

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
numerous mitigations have been proposed

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
to protect users from these threats

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,040
anti-phishing blacklists are a key

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,799
technical mitigation

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
the key ecosystem of defense which is

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
default in major desktop and mobile

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,840
browsers

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,759
and also integrated in other contexts

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
blacklists use an automated crawler back

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
end

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
and seek to detect malicious websites

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,000
and then add them to their block lists

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,919
the goals are timeline comprehensive

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
detection and a low false positive rate

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
to avoid disruptions

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
unfortunately blacklists are vulnerable

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,000
to evasion techniques known as cloaking

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
as identified in prior work in this

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
research we focus on evaluating the

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,280
blacklists which protect today's major

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,799
web browsers

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
these blacklists include google safe

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
browsing microsoft smart screen and

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,759
opera

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
we propose three key criteria to

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,720
evaluate blacklists

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,159
coverage is a percentage of known

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
malicious websites that end up being

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
blocked

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,919
speed is the delay between attack

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,559
deployment and blacklisting and then

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
there's consistency across platforms

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,079
any gaps in these metrics can have

60
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,240
security implications which we want to

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
evaluate in this research

62
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,158
prior research has looked at individual

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
anti-phishing entities

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
and their gaps in blacklisting however

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
in this work we want to look at

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
how vulnerable the ecosystem is as a

67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
whole to modern day and fishing

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,160
and we do this by continuously

69
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
monitoring blacklists

70
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,440
to perform long-term verification of

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
baseline defenses

72
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,920
and identifying any gaps that might

73
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,519
exist in those defenses

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,280
in addition we want to realistically

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,959
evaluate blacklisting delays or

76
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,040
blacklisting speed

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,879
we do this by discovering and then

78
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,640
testing evasion techniques that real

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,560
phishing websites use

80
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,399
and we simulate ecosystem detection

81
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,319
methods against these techniques

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
to carry out continuous monitoring and

83
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,760
evaluation of blacklists we propose the

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
fishtime framework

85
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,640
this framework starts by monitoring the

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,879
blacklist status of live phishing urls

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,079
and we collect these urls from multiple

88
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,640
data sources

89
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
in our deployment we used urls reported

90
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,679
directly to paypal

91
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,440
as well as paypal phishing urls reported

92
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
at the anti-phishing working group

93
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
because we were collaborating with

94
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,799
paypal for the experiments later in this

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,319
presentation

96
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
during our deployment we collected about

97
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,640
4 400 urls total

98
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,640
we immediately checked their blacklist

99
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,518
status and discarded those that were

100
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,518
blacklisted

101
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
initially those that were not

102
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
blacklisted we actually took

103
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
and reported them back to each

104
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
respective blacklist

105
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,280
hoping that they would be acted upon we

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
then continue monitoring those urls

107
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
and if they are not subsequently

108
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,399
blacklisted we scrutinize them further

109
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
to understand what went

110
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,599
wrong and why they were not acted upon

111
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,319
this left us with 183 urls

112
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
or 4.2 percent although this might not

113
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,000
seem like a large percentage

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,599
prior work has shown that individual

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
phishing attacks

116
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,319
if sophisticated can account for a

117
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
significant proportion of victims

118
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,000
we then analyze these websites to try to

119
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
understand the various evasion

120
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
techniques and configurations

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that may have successfully been evading

122
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,760
mitigations such as blacklists

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
we then use these insights to design and

124
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,599
deploy experiments

125
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
which deploy artificial websites which

126
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
are then

127
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,760
launched and reported to blacklists and

128
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,920
monitored

129
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,599
for the blacklisting status and this

130
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,079
uses an enhanced version

131
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,199
of the empirical test testbed that we

132
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
proposed in prior work

133
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,960
using the insights provided by the

134
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,479
fishtime framework

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,758
we defined artificial website

136
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,280
configurations to evaluate blacklists

137
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
we started with a set of baseline

138
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,359
websites that allow all traffic

139
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,199
just to serve as a control group we also

140
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
found some websites to use very basic

141
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
evasion techniques

142
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,679
also known as cloaking such as checking

143
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,199
the user agent

144
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
or checking to see if javascript was

145
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,880
running in the browser

146
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,638
the more typical efficient websites

147
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,639
which accounted for the majority of

148
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
websites that we identified

149
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
combined multiple types of cloaking in

150
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,840
particular

151
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
redirection links from the original

152
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,159
email as well as

153
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,759
server-side or client-side evasion in

154
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
our experiments we chose server-side

155
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,400
evasion and redirection

156
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,239
we also observed some domains being

157
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,120
reused as well as certain servers being

158
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,039
reused

159
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
so we attempted to simulate this by

160
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
reusing our own domains in certain

161
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,840
experiments

162
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,280
with the same configuration as the

163
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,280
set c here finally

164
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,599
in another deployment of fish time we

165
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,520
characterized emerging threats

166
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
and this includes included innovative

167
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,799
evasion techniques

168
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
that are based on user interaction with

169
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,960
the phishing websites

170
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,960
such as captchas mouse movement or

171
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,719
pop-up messages that the user must click

172
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
on

173
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,639
finally we identified new reporting

174
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,360
protocols being used by the ecosystem

175
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
and we wanted to evaluate these you may

176
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,320
notice

177
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,759
that group e is missing from this list

178
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,599
that's included in the paper

179
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,400
and was a control group that served to

180
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,240
evaluate our methodology

181
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,239
here's an example of the artificial

182
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,960
efficient websites that we deployed

183
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,560
they had the look and feel of paypal.com

184
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,239
as of the beginning of 2019.

185
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
at a high level our longitudinal

186
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,759
experiments consisted of deployments of

187
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,318
multiple batches of artificial fission

188
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
websites

189
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
as previously described we had six total

190
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
deployments and one preliminary

191
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
deployment

192
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,120
between march 2019 and january 2020.

193
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
each respective url was simultaneously

194
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,759
reported to numerous anti-phishing

195
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,759
entities

196
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,440
in an effort to simulate how detection

197
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
happens in the wild

198
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,639
we then monitored the blacklisting

199
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,359
status of each phishing website

200
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,560
for one week across numerous platforms

201
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
total we had 4158 urls

202
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
and these were hosted on newly

203
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,919
registered and randomized.com domains

204
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
with extensive controls to prevent

205
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,758
confounding factors as we described in

206
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,280
the paper

207
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,880
now i would like to move on to our

208
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,880
experimental results

209
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,800
due to time limitations i only cover the

210
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,400
key findings in this presentation

211
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,479
please take a look at the paper for our

212
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
full analysis

213
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
looking at our basic phishing websites

214
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
with no evasion techniques

215
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
we observed very consistent blacklisting

216
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
in five out of the six deployments

217
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
however in the third deployment in

218
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
september 2019

219
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,479
we saw a significant drop both from

220
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
google safe browsing and microsoft smart

221
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,120
screen

222
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,039
we looked into this and found that one

223
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240
of the anti-fishing crawlers that

224
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
sent traffic throughout the other

225
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
deployments apparently failed to do so

226
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,799
in this deployment or at least to the

227
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
same extent we notified the affected

228
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,680
organization and we believe that this

229
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,679
led to resolution of the issue

230
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,318
now let's take a look at the blacklisted

231
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
performance of individual blacklists and

232
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
platforms

233
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,039
on the y-axis we have the blacklist

234
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,880
coverage with 100

235
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
meaning that every single website was

236
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
ultimately blocked

237
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,719
on the x-axis we have the speed which is

238
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
the number of hours elapsed between our

239
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
report

240
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
and the black listing itself we observed

241
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
that google chrome

242
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
and desktop was generally the fastest

243
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,440
responding blacklist

244
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,878
and by the end of our deployments over

245
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
ninety percent of the websites were

246
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,840
blocked

247
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
microsoft's smart screen was a little

248
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,479
bit slower to react at first

249
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,599
but ultimately managed to edge out safe

250
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,560
browsing

251
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
at the end of the experiments however

252
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
the opera blacklist

253
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,800
even though it reacted almost as quickly

254
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,919
as chrome at the beginning

255
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,400
ultimately had a much lower coverage

256
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,440
finally google safe browsing or chrome

257
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
on mobile

258
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,280
actually had a much smaller coverage in

259
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,639
the long term and we found this to be a

260
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,638
key weakness of the ecosystem

261
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,199
now let's take a closer look at

262
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,039
blacklist speed and coverage and see how

263
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
different fission website configurations

264
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
affect them

265
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
note that in these measurements we

266
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,599
exclude the problematic detections that

267
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
we observed in september

268
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,720
first let's consider fishing websites

269
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,200
with note of asian

270
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
these are blacklisted after a median 50

271
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,839
minutes with a 99

272
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,800
coverage with basic evasion added to the

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,560
mix however

274
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,399
it took nine minutes longer for

275
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
blacklisting to happen and coverage

276
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
decreased by five percent

277
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,518
with the addition of typical evasion so

278
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
redirection with some sort of cloaking

279
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,680
the blacklisting speed dropped further

280
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,640
to two hours and 48 minutes

281
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
as did the coverage

282
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,800
even with infrastructure reuse where we

283
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
have the same domains previously

284
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,359
detected as fishing

285
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
the speed with a typical evasion was

286
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,120
still slower than with basic evasion

287
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
even though coverage did recover a

288
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,800
little bit

289
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,399
however with emerging evasion techniques

290
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,760
those sophisticated ones that require

291
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,200
user interaction

292
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,800
we actually saw no blacklisting

293
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,160
whatsoever in google chrome

294
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
comparing these numbers to mobile

295
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
firefox we actually observe identical

296
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,640
results

297
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
which is a testament to the excellent

298
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,880
performance of this mobile browser

299
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,560
however we were not able to replicate

300
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
the same results in mobile chrome

301
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
which had a much slower speed and lesser

302
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
coverage

303
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
in all cases

304
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
if we look at ways in which phishing is

305
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
currently reported most major

306
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,880
organizations accept the bare url

307
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,640
representing the fission website

308
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,200
however if the underlying back-end

309
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,680
systems fail to retrieve the content

310
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
due to innovation technique even

311
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,479
resubmissions of that url

312
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,480
may not result in blacklisting

313
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
in mid-2019 google released the

314
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
suspicious site reporter extension

315
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,000
which allows users to submit additional

316
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,640
evidence such as

317
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,519
ip addresses or redirection chains when

318
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,680
reporting phishing through google chrome

319
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
using artificial efficient websites we

320
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,920
sought to compare how reporting through

321
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,839
the traditional

322
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,680
channel compared to this enhanced

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
evidence-based reporting

324
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
we found that over the course of the

325
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
first four hours the traditional method

326
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
was in fact faster

327
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,560
even though they ended up having similar

328
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,719
coverage after about four hours

329
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
however in the long term the traditional

330
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
method resulted in just

331
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,359
that same amount of coverage whereas

332
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,279
coverage continued growing

333
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,640
for the evidence-based reporting they

334
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,320
therefore believe this is a very

335
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
promising technology

336
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
and are recommended for the entire

337
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
ecosystem

338
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
in addition to our ecosystem findings we

339
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,000
made numerous disclosures

340
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,680
following our research as a result the

341
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,040
opera browser now uses additional

342
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,319
back-end data sources

343
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
which has increased its speed and

344
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,200
coverage especially in mobile devices

345
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,120
similarly google is working to enhance

346
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,720
mobile blacklist coverage

347
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
and has released new features in the

348
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
latest version of google chrome

349
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
which we're unfortunately not able to

350
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,359
test in time

351
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,360
finally we are working with the

352
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
anti-fishing working group to offer fish

353
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,160
time

354
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,239
as an ecosystem level service to

355
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,920
continuously monitor the ecosystem

356
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
and continue making these kinds of

357
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,920
measurements so we can

358
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,320
identify gaps and help protect users who

359
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
might be affected

360
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,200
in conclusion we believe that

361
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
longitudinal measurements are key to

362
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
understanding

363
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
the current protections offered by the

364
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,399
anti-fishing ecosystem

365
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
and they support a proactive

366
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,200
anti-fishing approach which can be used

367
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
to discover

368
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
new sophisticated attack variants in

369
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
addition

370
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,200
these kinds of measurements are not

371
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,839
currently being done at the ecosystem

372
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
level

373
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,360
and it's exactly what fishtime is

374
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
designed to support

375
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
sophisticated evasion and phishing

376
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,240
remains a key threat

377
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
and it's important to close blacklisting

378
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,839
gaps on mobile devices

379
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,279
and also improved data sharing reporting

380
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,120
protocols and detection methods

381
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,800
in this work we did not attempt to

382
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
understand the impact of blacklisting

383
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,760
delays on victims themselves

384
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,599
however this is something that we

385
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
discuss in another paper at this

386
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,360
conference

387
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
thank you very much for listening and

388
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:39,839
please feel free to contact me if you

389
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:41,920
have any questions

390
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
you
