1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,599
hello

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
and welcome to the election security

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,639
panel

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,080
my name is avi rubin and i'm a computer

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,400
science professor at johns hopkins

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,479
university the way this panel is going

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,240
to work is each of the panelists

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,720
is going to pre-record a short statement

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,159
maybe about 10 minutes and you're going

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
to see those now

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
and after that we're going to open it up

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,040
to the audience to ask questions

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
you can ask a question by typing it into

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
the chat and then i will read the

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
questions

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
to the panelists who will then answer

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,559
them and hopefully we'll have a lively

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
discussion

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,399
so i worked on election security for

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
many years

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
uh i was the director of nsf center that

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
was devoted to that

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,559
issue and when i was working on election

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,599
security the big

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,879
issues were the secret ballot

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,879
privacy audit uh whether or not uh there

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,199
was a dispute in the election would we

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,520
be able to recreate what happened

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,399
could you do recounts and a lot of the

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,399
work uh

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
and a lot of the controversy centered

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
around paper ballots versus electronic

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,119
voting

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,320
so today we're about to face an election

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,880
and we are seeing

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,439
unprecedented uh issues that are coming

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
up

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,880
and it's not so much about whether we

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
should use paper ballots paper ballots

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
are actually being used almost

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,960
everywhere now thankfully

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,360
but the issue of vote by mail and the

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,720
reason

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,240
obviously is with the kovit 19 crisis

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,679
that we're undergoing

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,399
many people don't want to go to the

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
polls justifiably it could be dangerous

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
and a more likely chance that they could

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,720
be infected with the virus

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,960
or catch it and infect other people and

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
so there's going to be a strong push to

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
vote by mail

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,679
at the same time the president of the

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
united states has already

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
gone on record to claim that there's a

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
lot of fraud and vote by mail and that

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,000
vote by mail is not reliable

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,119
and so we are headed perhaps for the

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,960
perfect storm

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,679
of this global pandemic a president who

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
is interested in challenging the results

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,760
before the election even happens who

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
challenged the results last time even

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,160
though he won

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,200
and a very supercharged

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,040
public that is going to uh

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,280
i think create a lot of drama in this

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,440
election and so i brought together

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,720
uh some election security experts to

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
give their thoughts

71
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,400
we have alex halderman ben adida and

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,519
vanessa teague who are going to provide

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
excellent uh thoughts and commentary and

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
then

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,440
we'll discuss issues with each other and

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,679
with the audience

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,760
and so i'm confident that this is going

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
to be a very interesting

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,000
and engaging panel especially for the

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,400
usenix security audience and

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
i'm really looking forward to seeing

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
this so

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,440
with that i will hand it off to our

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
first speaker who is alex halderman

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,319
i'm alex halderman from the university

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
of michigan and i'm going to give you

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,079
a quick overview of the election cyber

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,599
security landscape

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,239
as we head into 2020. election security

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,480
changed forever four years ago when

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,920
russia committed cyber attacks against

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
the 2016 u.s presidential election

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,440
you probably remembered the targeted

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,879
political leaks against the hillary

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
clinton campaign

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,920
and the bots and fake accounts on social

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
media

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,518
that waged a campaign the intelligence

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,920
community has concluded was

100
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
intended to so discord and advantage

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,640
donald trump

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
my focus today will be attacks against

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
election infrastructure

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,879
the complex computer systems that handle

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,959
the voting process

106
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,399
we know from the investigations of the

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,120
intelligence community

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
and the special counsel that russian

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,319
attackers

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
probed election-related computer systems

111
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,319
in all 50 states

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
and in multiple states they were able to

113
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,079
infiltrate the voter registration

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
databases

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
they also infiltrated at least one

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,238
election system vendor

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,480
and attempted to infiltrate county and

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,720
local election offices

119
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,358
the russian attackers had the ability to

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,519
change or destroy registration data

121
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,120
which would have caused massive chaos as

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,960
voters showed up to the polls

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
only to be told they weren't properly

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,039
registered

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,039
we know they didn't change that data

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
because there wasn't massive chaos in

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
2016

128
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
but it wasn't technology that stopped

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
them

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
nor is there any evidence that russia

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
changed votes

132
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,680
but once again it wasn't technology that

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,479
stopped them

134
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,639
my belief is that in both of these cases

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,359
russia was stopped only because vladimir

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,120
putin

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
chose not to pull the trigger

138
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,919
as i told the senate intelligence

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
committee's russia investigation three

140
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,680
years ago

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,239
the key lesson from 2016 is that

142
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960
election

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,280
infrastructure hacking threats are real

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,560
and as james comey testified

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,758
we know they'll be back and next time

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,919
they could do a lot more

147
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,840
damage that's because one of the

148
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,240
persistent vulnerabilities

149
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,320
in u.s election systems has been the

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
voting machines themselves

151
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,240
there are many different models used

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
across the country but they break down

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
into three

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,199
main styles we have a hand marked

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
optical scan

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,600
where voters fill out a paper ballot

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,080
that gets counted by a computer

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
after it's mailed in or deposited into a

159
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,280
ballot box

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,440
we have bmds or ballot marking devices

161
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,559
on which voters cast a vote on a touch

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,639
screen and then

163
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
have a paper ballot printed for them

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
that they can deposit into an optical

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,360
scanner

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,800
bmds are widely used for accessibility

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,880
finally we have dre or direct recording

168
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,880
electronic voting machines

169
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
on which voters cast a vote on a touch

170
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,159
screen that gets recorded

171
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,240
entirely within computer memory some

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,160
models also print a paper trail

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
called a vivi pad but those are

174
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
increasingly rare

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,759
our community has been studying

176
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
vulnerabilities in voting machines for

177
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,639
many years

178
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
going back to a paper that avi

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,639
co-authored in 2003

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
since then we've studied dozens of

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,880
different models

182
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,880
including optical scanners and dres and

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,240
in virtually every case

184
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
researchers have discovered

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
vulnerabilities that would enable

186
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,318
attackers to steal

187
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,239
votes how hard would it be to exploit

188
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
these vulnerabilities to change the

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,759
outcome of the national election

190
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,840
actually a lot easier than it might seem

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
using pre-election polls

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
attackers could identify likely swing

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,599
states and scan them all for

194
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,758
vulnerabilities as russia did in 2016.

195
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,919
next the attackers would infiltrate

196
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
jurisdictions or service providers

197
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,639
that operate election management systems

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
computers that are used to program the

199
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599
voting machines before every election

200
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,039
from there they could spread malware to

201
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,159
voting machines throughout the

202
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,400
jurisdiction

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,199
and reprogram them to change the digital

204
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,359
records of a small fraction of votes

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
even if each vote is also recorded on a

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
piece of paper

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,880
the unfortunate reality is that most

208
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,360
states will throw away the paper ballots

209
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
without having rigorously checked them

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,240
as a result

211
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,520
an attack could change the outcome of

212
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
the national election

213
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,840
and we might never find out

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,160
fortunately we know a practical way to

215
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,919
defend against vote stealing attacks

216
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,639
without requiring any security

217
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,520
breakthroughs it's a simple formula

218
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,039
record every vote on a paper ballot and

219
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,280
check the machine counts

220
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,400
using a statistically rigorous audit of

221
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,318
the paper

222
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,758
this approach has been endorsed by the

223
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,440
national academies

224
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,360
and a growing number of election

225
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,520
administrators

226
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
paper might seem like a step backwards

227
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
but security experts know better

228
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,639
we want critical systems to have

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,960
physical fail safes whenever possible

230
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,080
although passenger jets use computer

231
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,239
navigation

232
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,479
they're still required by law to have a

233
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
magnetic compass in the cockpit

234
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,479
and when you ride in a car you really

235
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
want there to be a physical linkage

236
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,960
between the brake pedal and the brakes

237
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,840
just in case the computers fail or get

238
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,758
hacked

239
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
it's the same with paper ballots and

240
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,440
voting

241
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,199
of course there's a long history of

242
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
fraud involving tampering with

243
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
old-fashioned paper ballots

244
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,838
that's why modern optical scan voting

245
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,599
systems create a digital record of every

246
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,760
vote as its cast

247
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,760
as long as we check the digital records

248
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,799
against the paper records to make sure

249
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
they agree

250
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,760
an attacker would have to change them

251
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,600
both to escape detection

252
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,240
we don't even need to inspect every

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
ballot that's because in recent years

254
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,760
statisticians have developed highly

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
efficient methods for using paper

256
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,000
ballots to verify election results

257
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,160
known as risk limiting audits in an rla

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,080
workers hand count randomly selected

259
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,199
ballots until they establish with high

260
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,200
probability

261
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
that hand counting all the paper ballots

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,760
would yield the same winner

263
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
most elections aren't close so the audit

264
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,839
can be completed

265
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,959
using just a small random sample so we

266
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,440
have a blueprint for securing elections

267
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,399
how far have we come over the last four

268
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
years

269
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,440
there's been a lot of progress but

270
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,800
elections still face

271
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,640
some major security challenges

272
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,319
i think the most important advance

273
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
compared to 2016

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
is that there's now a vastly greater

275
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
awareness of election cyber security

276
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
threats

277
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
there's also increased cooperation

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,519
between the federal government and state

279
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,200
and local officials

280
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
the past four years have also seen

281
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
important upgrades to many state voter

282
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,320
registration systems

283
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
including intrusion detection

284
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,640
capabilities and penetration testing

285
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,360
as well as updates to polling place

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,600
equipment across many jurisdictions

287
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
more recently several states have even

288
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,279
started implementing or piloting

289
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,680
risk limiting audits on the whole though

290
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,680
significant weaknesses remain and

291
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,239
despite major investments

292
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,399
u.s elections are still a patchwork of

293
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,720
strength and weakness

294
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
this spotty performance is due in part

295
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
to congress

296
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,480
which provided states with 1.2 billion

297
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
dollars in new election funds

298
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,560
but didn't impose any security standards

299
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,719
or requirements

300
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,599
consequently heading into the 2020

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
election

302
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
u.s voting systems still face several

303
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,920
serious challenges

304
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,399
the first challenge is continued use of

305
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,199
unauditable paperless voting

306
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,440
since 2016 the fraction of paperless

307
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,200
votes has fallen from 24

308
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
to 14 today but nine states still don't

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
record

310
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,720
every vote on paper meanwhile the

311
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,239
fraction of votes cast on hand marked

312
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,320
paper ballots has actually

313
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,320
fallen from 75 percent to 65 percent

314
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
the reason is that many jurisdictions

315
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
have replaced obsolete paperless

316
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
machines

317
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
with ballot marking devices for all

318
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,839
voters

319
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,360
these bmds are the second challenge bmds

320
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,480
are essential for voters with

321
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,720
disabilities

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
but some officials favor using them for

323
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,839
everyone for reasons that ben will

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
explain

325
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
the problem is that if bmds are hacked

326
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
they could mark different candidates

327
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,120
than what voters selected on screen

328
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,079
no audit could catch this cheating since

329
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,720
the paper trail itself would be wrong

330
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,319
in principle voters could detect this by

331
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
reviewing the printouts

332
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,240
but when we tested this by asking people

333
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,880
to vote on bmds that we hacked ourselves

334
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,079
voters reported fewer than 7 percent of

335
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,079
errors

336
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,239
in a close election that would mean

337
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,638
voters would report much less than one

338
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,200
problem per polling place on average

339
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,920
even if the bmds have cheated on enough

340
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
ballots to steal the election

341
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,160
encouraging voters to review the

342
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,079
printouts seems to help somewhat

343
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,839
but the effect is not clearly large

344
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,719
enough to detect fraud in close

345
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
elections

346
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,240
when all voters use bmds as is the case

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839
for jurisdictions where 20 percent of

348
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,639
voters live

349
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
notably using bmds exclusively for

350
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,560
accessibility

351
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,800
as most other jurisdictions do requires

352
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,839
only a much lower and more realistic

353
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
rate of voter verification

354
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
the next challenge is that even though

355
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
41 states now have a paper record of

356
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,240
every vote

357
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,399
barely half audit the paper trail before

358
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,040
declaring the election winner

359
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
even then only two states colorado and

360
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,880
rhode island

361
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
require these audits to be risk limiting

362
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,920
in the rest

363
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,760
the audit will sometimes examine too few

364
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,279
ballots to detect fraud with high

365
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,519
probability

366
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,639
there is some good news nine other

367
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
states either allow

368
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,200
rlas or are piloting them so we might

369
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,360
see a few more in november

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,440
but there's a lot more work to do to

371
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,959
ensure that computer counts everywhere

372
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,040
are rigorously scrutinized covid 19

373
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,638
poses enormous new challenges for

374
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,680
in-person voting

375
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,920
in response 17 states have adopted

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
changes to make it easier to vote by

377
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,279
mail

378
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
mail in voting does introduce new

379
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
security risks

380
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,600
and in fact most confirmed cases of

381
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,519
voter fraud involve absentee ballots

382
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,839
but the evidence points to hundreds of

383
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,639
instances not millions as sometimes

384
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
claimed

385
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
and attacking large numbers of mail-in

386
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,440
ballots would require a large conspiracy

387
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,279
and leave abundant physical evidence

388
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,120
the bigger worry is that the rapid

389
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,279
expansion of vote by mail will leave

390
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,160
officials insufficiently prepared

391
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,320
and voters confused about the new rules

392
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,439
it also ensures that a meltdown at the

393
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
postal service

394
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,560
would cause widespread chaos in november

395
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,600
covet is also increasing pressure on

396
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,800
states to allow

397
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,040
greater use of online voting just last

398
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,599
month delaware allowed anyone to cast a

399
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,399
ballot

400
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
using a web portal of course this is

401
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,079
crazy

402
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,360
10 years ago i hacked washington dc's

403
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,519
online voting pilot

404
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,519
and changed all the votes in just 48

405
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,839
hours it's foolish to think that

406
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,279
adversaries like russia couldn't do the

407
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,440
same

408
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,839
someday the excellent line of research

409
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
into end-to-end verifiable cryptographic

410
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,920
voting schemes

411
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,319
might let us vote online safely but that

412
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,639
still

413
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,920
seems years away and the systems

414
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,199
marketed in the us

415
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,240
now are not verifiable or secure last

416
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
but not least

417
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,959
u.s elections face a separate challenge

418
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,360
on top of ensuring integrity

419
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,719
ensuring that the outcome is perceived

420
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,880
as legitimate

421
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
as an old saying goes elections need to

422
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,360
convince the losers

423
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,279
that they lost even absent an attack

424
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,040
the chaotic november could create the

425
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,480
appearance of impropriety

426
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,800
which would be easy fodder for

427
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,279
misinformation and make the outcome hard

428
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,920
for much of the country to accept

429
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,439
to me the underlying problem is that u.s

430
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,319
elections too often demand

431
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,839
faith in opaque technology processes and

432
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,079
public servants

433
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
instead we should be engineering them to

434
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,959
generate evidence

435
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,199
of their correctness through

436
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,239
transparency and observability

437
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,599
that anyone who cares can check with

438
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
just 83 days

439
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,000
until the presidential election there

440
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,160
are still things you can do to help

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
volunteer as a poll worker there's no

442
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,480
better way to understand the challenges

443
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
get involved in election related

444
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,560
research most importantly

445
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,719
vote looking ahead the next congress has

446
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,319
an opportunity to make u.s elections

447
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
vastly more secure

448
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
by setting minimum standards that

449
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,160
provide for paper ballots

450
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,600
risk limiting audits and other security

451
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
practices

452
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,639
election security is complex but these

453
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,720
simple steps will put us much closer

454
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,160
to election outcomes that everyone can

455
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,440
believe in

456
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,000
thank you hi

457
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,920
i'm excited to be here on this panel

458
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
with my colleagues avi ruben alex

459
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,599
halderman and vanessa t

460
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
my talk is entitled don't attribute to

461
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,240
malice

462
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
my name is ben i'm the executive

463
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,040
director of votingworks

464
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,360
votingworks is a non-partisan nonprofit

465
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,959
working to build a secure affordable and

466
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,959
open source voting system

467
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,239
for the u.s we started a little more

468
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,479
than a year and a half ago

469
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,079
this is our first prototype thankfully

470
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
my eight-year-old helped with some of

471
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,959
the qa

472
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
and this was the first model that we

473
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,359
created in august

474
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
of 2019 a little more than a year ago

475
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,240
with a touch screen

476
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
on the left and a printer that prints

477
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,880
out the ballots connected to it on the

478
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,480
right

479
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,720
we deployed the system for the first

480
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
time almost exactly a year ago

481
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,560
in one precinct in one county choctaw

482
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,480
county mississippi

483
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,719
and the election went pretty well we got

484
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
some feedback we tested it including

485
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
with voters with disabilities

486
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
we created the new version of the system

487
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,119
with the poll worker check-in station on

488
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
the left

489
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,440
the ballot marking station in the middle

490
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
and the ballot printing station

491
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,759
on the right all of these are easy to

492
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
unpack and set up and pack up again

493
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,319
at the end of the day you'll notice that

494
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,640
we separated the ballot marking station

495
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,559
from the ballot printing station so that

496
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,039
a single precinct that may need

497
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,000
five six up to ten ballot marking

498
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,400
devices

499
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,319
actually now only needs one printer and

500
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
maybe a second one as a backup

501
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,520
what's really important about that is

502
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,918
that our entire system

503
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,359
is now a lot easier to haul into the

504
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,160
precinct by poll workers

505
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,159
and consumes significantly less power

506
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,799
than some other competing systems

507
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,600
in fact as little as one-tenth the power

508
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,080
requirement

509
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
that other systems may have we found out

510
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
over the last few weeks

511
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
that this is actually super important as

512
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,120
some states have had trouble

513
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,879
with equipment consuming too much power

514
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,000
at the precinct he assembled

515
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,919
almost 100 units in my garage ran

516
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,320
the november gubernatorial election for

517
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
the whole choctaw county in mississippi

518
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,600
and eventually the presidential primary

519
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,440
in march and this

520
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,879
is the tabulation part at the end of the

521
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
day with the election officials

522
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,200
for the county using the scanner that we

523
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,360
provide to tabulate all those ballots

524
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
we also had a deployment in wisconsin

525
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
for a small test selection with our

526
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
friends at microsoft

527
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,639
most recently we've been working on

528
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
handmarked paper ballots producing them

529
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,919
and scanning them as well as all the

530
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
additional equipment

531
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
like envelopes that you might need to do

532
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,918
vote by mail

533
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,879
and beyond that we also work on open

534
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,520
source software

535
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
to run risk limiting audits of which we

536
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,639
expect

537
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
five six maybe seven statewide risk

538
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
limiting audits

539
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,799
this november occasionally

540
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
we have trouble getting printer through

541
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,440
the door too we can build

542
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,360
much better voting systems than what's

543
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,280
out there today

544
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,959
but we shouldn't attribute to malice

545
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,360
what can be explained by ignorance or

546
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
stupidity and we're all ignorant and

547
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,320
stupid at times so

548
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,840
this is not meant to be an attack on any

549
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,720
one party

550
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,039
and we shouldn't attribute to stupidity

551
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,000
what may be a requirement

552
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,840
that we don't understand let me give you

553
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,320
two examples

554
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,199
qr code ballots and ballot marking

555
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,678
devices

556
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,600
let's talk about qr code balance if

557
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,799
you've heard about these barcode ballots

558
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,039
you might be worried about something

559
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,760
like this just a barcode

560
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,440
and no candidate text that's terrible

561
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
how can you possibly tell who you voted

562
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
for

563
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
here's the good news no machine on the

564
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,440
market does that today

565
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,760
this is what the ballots look like on

566
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,320
the left other vendors ballots

567
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,240
on the right are ballot at voting works

568
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,600
there are barcodes on these ballots

569
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,240
but there is also human readable text

570
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
so you can see it now what if the

571
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,679
barcode doesn't match the text

572
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,199
shouldn't we be ocr in this come on

573
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,720
right that would be your reaction if

574
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
you're a paranoid security person of

575
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,799
which

576
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
i hear there might be a few in the

577
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,120
audience today and that's a reasonable

578
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,039
first reaction but you have to

579
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,439
understand the requirements

580
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,039
the requirement and it's a good one is

581
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,480
that these scanners have to scan

582
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,879
10 million ballot positions accurately

583
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,159
and they have to do it fast a few

584
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,600
ballots per second

585
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,480
we cannot do that with ocr today

586
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,439
that's why there is a machine readable

587
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
version of the ballot

588
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,360
on those ballots it's not for any stupid

589
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,080
reason it's not for any nefarious reason

590
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,039
it's because it's necessary now you

591
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
might still be worried about the

592
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
security of it

593
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
but here's the deal this problem exists

594
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
with

595
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,960
bubble ballots too the position of the

596
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,360
bubble

597
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,799
is what decides what the ballot is for

598
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,399
so if there's a misprint

599
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,400
and those misprints have happened plenty

600
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
of times before what you think you're

601
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
filling out on a bubble ballot

602
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
might actually be counted differently

603
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
the human readable and the machine

604
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,799
readable version of the ballot

605
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
may be different whether it's a bubble

606
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,520
ballot or a qr code ballot

607
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,760
and yes i know the qr code looks scarier

608
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,240
but it's not actually any worse

609
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,080
the way you fix the problem either way

610
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,760
is with an audit at the end because if

611
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,360
there's a mismatch between the human

612
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,679
readable and the machine readable

613
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,199
that will show up and thankfully if you

614
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,000
run a risk limiting audit on the

615
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,840
tabulation

616
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,919
which you should be doing anyways for

617
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,720
other reasons to check the tabulator

618
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,520
you will catch these issues too so for

619
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,679
free

620
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,600
you can protect against this issue in

621
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,000
other words as long as there is human

622
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,039
readable

623
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,320
text on the ballot barcodes are not a

624
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,799
problem

625
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,158
okay example number two ballot marking

626
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,918
devices themselves

627
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
right these are machines that voters use

628
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
to prepare their and print their ballot

629
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,200
and you might want to ask and many

630
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,039
people do ask you know these ballot

631
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,760
marking devices they look all fancy are

632
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,360
we just

633
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,360
you know throwing technology at a

634
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,918
problem that could be solved just with a

635
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,799
pen

636
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,760
come on 3 500 bucks or more in some

637
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,400
cases

638
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,520
okay or is this a lot less expensive but

639
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,159
3 500 bucks

640
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,440
or a one dollar pen come on here's the

641
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,600
requirement

642
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
voters with disabilities deserve a

643
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,080
secret ballot

644
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,480
too you may hear this and think

645
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,000
okay but that's an edge case we're

646
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,240
really not going to design this whole

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,039
thing around an edge case are we

648
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,960
it's not an edge case more than 10

649
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,960
million voters in the us

650
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,720
have visual impairments that make it

651
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,679
difficult for them to read the 10 or 12

652
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,440
point font

653
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,880
on a ballot and you know what else

654
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,400
most of us are only temporarily abled

655
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,360
if we're lucky we grow old

656
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
and can't read 12 point font so we need

657
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,399
these bmds

658
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,240
and thankfully this is codified in the

659
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
voluntary voting systems guidelines and

660
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,760
the help america vote act

661
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,158
that voters with disabilities have the

662
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,640
right to a secret ballot that they can

663
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,440
cast

664
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,720
independently that's the requirement and

665
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
there's more

666
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,919
a number of states have implemented vote

667
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,480
centers

668
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
now think back way back six seven eight

669
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,960
months ago

670
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,879
when you actually used to leave your

671
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
home to go to work

672
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,480
and work was not just another space in

673
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,200
your home

674
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,400
a vote center lets you vote anywhere in

675
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,440
the county

676
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,200
sometimes early before election day and

677
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
having these vote centers

678
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,280
where any voter from the county can vote

679
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,080
now means that the vote center needs

680
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,000
dozens hundreds sometimes thousands of

681
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,879
different ballot styles available

682
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,520
right away and sometimes a dozen

683
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
languages

684
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,280
in which to have those ballots available

685
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,600
having paper ballots available

686
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,960
in all of those combinations is quite

687
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,760
tricky

688
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,200
but if you have a bmd the right ballot

689
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,080
in the right language can just show up

690
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,679
on the screen

691
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,918
that's a huge advantage operationally

692
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,360
another thing you might say is like fine

693
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,000
in some cases i can see the need for the

694
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,600
bmd but

695
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
i want my hand marked paper ballot and

696
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
by the way i tend to agree i think

697
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
voters should have a choice

698
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,000
but let's understand what the choice

699
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,240
means the choice means

700
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,120
that poll workers now need to manage two

701
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
different flows

702
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,959
at the precinct they get two hours of

703
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,159
training so i do think voters should

704
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,919
have a choice

705
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,919
but i think we should try to understand

706
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
why certain counties choose to go all

707
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,840
bmds

708
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,719
it's because it's actually hard to have

709
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,879
both

710
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,480
let's at least understand that even if

711
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,159
we think that maybe voters should have a

712
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
choice

713
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,440
that's all the reasons why we need bmts

714
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,600
because

715
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
many voters need them to independently

716
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,959
cast a secret ballot

717
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,200
and because it makes operations of an

718
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,640
election when we want to enfranchise as

719
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,679
many voters as possible with vote

720
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,279
centers etc

721
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,320
it makes that so much easier also

722
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,640
in practice the security fears of bmds

723
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,439
are

724
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,360
in my opinion overblown and the main

725
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,880
thing i want to say about that is

726
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,479
you can check your ballot it's a piece

727
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,240
of paper that comes out of a printer and

728
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
you can look at it and you can see what

729
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,279
you voted for

730
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,120
it's right there this is not like the

731
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,960
touch screen voting machines of your

732
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,479
where it just got recorded on some hard

733
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,080
drive and you can't check it

734
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,080
you can check the ballot that is the

735
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,639
ballot of record and we have a number of

736
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,720
studies

737
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,400
including this excellent oakland 2020

738
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,159
paper from dr matt bernhardt and

739
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,559
professor halderman that tell us that

740
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,159
if voters review the ballot they can

741
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
find errors this is a fear that people

742
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,039
have that maybe they don't remember how

743
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,199
they voted and whatnot

744
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,879
they can find errors especially for the

745
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,159
top level contests

746
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,159
so we have some hope that this can work

747
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,039
well more than hope we have some data

748
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,559
that voters can verify their ballot yes

749
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,799
there are still risks

750
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,639
there are risks in every stage of an

751
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,320
election and i think in practice

752
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,080
when you think about the entire flow of

753
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,320
what can go wrong in an election

754
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,240
the idea that the bmd is going to

755
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,080
maliciously misprint your ballot even

756
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,080
though you have a chance to check it

757
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,000
is not the top concern that i have

758
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,600
especially when you weigh that against

759
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,520
what it would mean if you didn't give

760
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,480
voters the choice to use a bmd

761
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,039
when so many of them need it the bmds

762
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,799
are here to stay as part of the solution

763
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,919
we should be working more on securing

764
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,000
them than i'm trying to push them out

765
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,360
so to be clear i'm not saying that

766
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
today's bmds are perfect

767
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,719
after all i'm doing this work because i

768
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,320
think they're far from perfect

769
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,159
they need to be much better designed for

770
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,720
voter verifiability they need to be

771
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,400
cheaper

772
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,240
they need to be much more resilient to

773
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
various issues and failures and

774
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,919
low power situations and no power

775
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,679
situations they need to leverage

776
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,960
modern security practices like secure

777
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
boot and beyond

778
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,279
we need to do better so

779
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,559
in conclusion we can build much better

780
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,679
voting systems

781
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,158
but as we look to do so we should not

782
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,600
attribute to stupidity what may actually

783
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,240
simply be a requirement

784
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,199
we didn't previously understand and one

785
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,679
more thing

786
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,640
election officials are the real heroes

787
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,400
here

788
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,760
they only get press and it's always bad

789
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
press when something goes wrong they

790
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,840
never get good press when things go well

791
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,439
they are the real heroes they've always

792
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,279
been the real heroes and they will be

793
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
especially the real heroes this year in

794
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,720
times of covid

795
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
you can help by signing up to be a poll

796
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
worker i really encourage you to do that

797
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,399
thank you i look forward to your

798
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,400
questions

799
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,880
my talk is trying to understand what we

800
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,440
can and cannot do

801
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,120
in order to secure elections i'm vanessa

802
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,559
teague and this is don't work with a

803
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,639
whole lot of other people who are listed

804
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,559
on the slide

805
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,880
first of all i want to try to understand

806
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,600
what problems are easy and what problems

807
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,799
are hard

808
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
when you first start looking at an

809
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,520
engineering problem you don't

810
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,320
immediately know

811
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,840
whether it's a really easy problem that

812
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,799
has never been looked at hard before or

813
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,959
whether it's a really

814
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,120
challenging problem so i'm going to talk

815
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
about two problems in election security

816
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,320
the first one is risk limiting audits

817
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
for instant runoff

818
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,918
voting and i'm going to show that that's

819
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,559
actually much easier

820
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
than we thought if you look five or ten

821
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,039
years back

822
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
into the literature you'll see a lot of

823
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,720
references to risk limiting audits for

824
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,559
instant run-off voting that say

825
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,480
basically that it's interactable well in

826
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,480
fact it's not intractable

827
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,159
and we have a very practical solution

828
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,399
that i'm going to overview briefly today

829
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
the second thing i want to talk about is

830
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,279
secure

831
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,120
voting over the internet a problem that

832
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,880
i've been working on for more than a

833
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,279
decade now

834
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,559
and basically every time i look at the

835
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,240
problem afresh

836
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,799
i think of a new reason that it's much

837
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,600
harder than i thought so the more we

838
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,158
learn about

839
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,719
voting over the internet the more

840
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,039
intractable it seems and the more we can

841
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,120
think

842
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,760
of disastrous ways that it could go

843
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,279
wrong

844
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,679
so first of all the good news let's talk

845
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,720
about instant runoff voting this is a

846
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,200
form of voting

847
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,200
already very common in australia already

848
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,880
in use in canada and in year in ireland

849
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
and a bunch of other places and

850
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,799
increasingly adopted in the united

851
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,399
states in san francisco

852
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,720
parts of colorado the idea is that

853
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,678
rather than selecting just your favorite

854
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
candidate

855
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,919
you select your favorite candidate and

856
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,200
your second favorite candidate and your

857
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,760
third favorite candidate

858
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,480
and so on and the first round of the

859
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,158
count is

860
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,320
exactly what you'd expect we count

861
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,120
everybody's first preferences

862
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,600
and if someone gets more than 50 percent

863
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,799
of the votes then they win out right

864
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,360
if they don't then we

865
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,639
remove the candidate who has the least

866
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,760
support

867
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,159
and for each person who voted for them

868
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,039
we shift we we eliminate them from the

869
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,320
election and

870
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,960
shift up the preferences of each vote

871
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,840
and then recount as if that candidate

872
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,480
hadn't been there

873
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,000
so the voters second choice becomes

874
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,159
their first choice their third choice

875
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,760
becomes their second choice and so forth

876
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
and then we recount and we keep doing

877
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,200
this until somebody gets a majority

878
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,600
not a plurality a majority so that's

879
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,880
great

880
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,320
it's actually a really good counting

881
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
algorithm which i love although i

882
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
acknowledge that not everybody does i

883
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,678
love in australia being able to put a

884
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,600
first preference against

885
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,440
my true favorite candidate who is

886
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,480
usually not a major party candidate and

887
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,559
then i like

888
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,760
to choose between the major parties with

889
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,760
my subsequent preferences

890
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,879
however one

891
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,678
challenge in instant runoff voting is

892
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
that it's

893
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,919
quite hard to figure out the margin and

894
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,760
it's sometimes even hard to figure out

895
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,320
the true runner-up

896
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,760
and you don't really know or it wasn't

897
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,799
really known how to run

898
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,158
efficient risk limiting audits of

899
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,000
an irv election so a risk limiting audit

900
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,200
is a statistical method of

901
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,840
testing an announced election result

902
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,120
and the rule is that the the definition

903
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,600
of a risk-limiting audit

904
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,799
is that we should have a bounded

905
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,678
probability

906
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,240
of mistakenly accepting the wrong

907
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,200
election result

908
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,159
so what we do is we gather statistical

909
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
evidence

910
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,000
either in support of or against the

911
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,640
election result and we either terminate

912
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,480
and say

913
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
yep we're happy with this election

914
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,880
result or

915
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,080
we consider that there has been too much

916
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
error or that the results are

917
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
unconvincing and then we do a full

918
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,559
manual

919
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,679
recount either way we get to the end of

920
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,799
the election

921
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,159
with some confidence that we

922
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,760
didn't mistakenly accept a

923
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,440
wrong result except with very small

924
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,600
probability

925
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,120
so let's look at how we might attempt to

926
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,480
apply this idea

927
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,360
to instant runoff voting well it turns

928
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,440
out we can

929
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,199
after many years of australian and

930
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,320
american research

931
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,279
we can do rlas for irv

932
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,760
first of all we run some australian code

933
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,559
to analyze the outcome and find the most

934
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,960
easily tested set of assertions

935
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,080
which imply the announced outcome if

936
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,840
they turn out to be true

937
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,199
and i'll show you at least where to find

938
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,120
the code for that in a minute

939
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
then we can test those assertions with

940
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,840
an rla

941
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,279
and we really tried it this is not just

942
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,320
theoretical work we conducted the first

943
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,480
pilot audit of an instant runoff

944
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,678
election in san francisco at the end of

945
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,919
last year

946
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,320
this was for the quite controversial san

947
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,880
francisco diaz race

948
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,399
and we did a pilot risk limiting audit

949
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
of just the vote by mail

950
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,158
ballots which unfortunately actually got

951
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,159
a different winner from the overall

952
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,760
election results so really all we tested

953
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,840
was that the

954
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
announced winner if you just counted the

955
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
vote by mail billets

956
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,840
was actually different from the overall

957
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,559
winner but the point is

958
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,360
that if we look at quantifying how

959
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,320
efficient these techniques can be

960
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,320
for a substantial level of confidence we

961
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,360
find that we get a very very

962
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,840
very low risk limit

963
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,240
out of really quite a small number of

964
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,760
sample ballots uh we got a risk lim

965
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,279
a risk well below 5 with a sample of

966
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,480
only about 200

967
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,360
irv ballots here's a picture of the

968
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
pilot audit and the nice thing about it

969
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,080
is all of the code is open source and

970
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,158
you can

971
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,000
go and double check the results if you

972
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,640
like of course you could only see the

973
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
actual

974
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,200
sampled paper ballots if you were one of

975
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,440
the citizens who chose to show up and

976
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,640
watch but all of the other calculations

977
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,399
all of the code

978
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,159
and everything else is still online and

979
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,360
you can still check

980
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,039
so we can do risk limiting audits for

981
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,479
instant runoff voting and that problem

982
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,679
turns out to be a lot

983
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,480
easier than we originally thought

984
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,760
which now brings me to internet voting

985
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
which is

986
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,440
harder and harder every time we think

987
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
about it

988
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,559
i'm going to talk for a couple of

989
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,639
minutes just a very brief overview of

990
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,519
some issues we found in the cryptography

991
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,159
of a system

992
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,000
that was going to be used in swiss

993
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,360
elections

994
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,760
if you want to see more of the geek

995
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,039
details there in my root talk

996
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,399
but the short summary is we found two

997
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,039
bugs

998
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,279
both in parts of the system that was

999
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,240
supposed to provide very sophisticated

1000
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,360
cryptographic

1001
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,000
proofs that the election outcome had

1002
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,039
been

1003
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,399
computed correctly this proof consisted

1004
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,000
of shuffling proof and a decryption

1005
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,120
proof we found two bugs one was in the

1006
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,799
shuffling proof and one was in the

1007
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,678
decryption proof

1008
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,918
here's a little example of a set of

1009
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,480
input cipher texts that we claim

1010
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,720
to be shuffled to appropriately produce

1011
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,240
that set of output ciphertexts and if

1012
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,440
you know a little bit about how algamal

1013
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,520
encryption works you can see

1014
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,839
immediately that these ciphertexts are

1015
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,960
not the same not the same at all

1016
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,000
and yet we successfully produced

1017
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,399
a zero knowledge proof which purported

1018
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,159
to demonstrate that this was in fact a

1019
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,279
valid shuffle to shuffle past

1020
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,760
verification

1021
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,720
both in theory by looking at the spec

1022
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,800
and also

1023
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,839
by running the practical tests that came

1024
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,320
with the code

1025
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,599
you can see this and other example proof

1026
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,599
transcripts at that link

1027
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,240
so there was an error in the

1028
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,399
cryptography of the system which broke

1029
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,040
verifiability an absolutely core

1030
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,040
requirement for swiss internet voting

1031
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,040
the exploitation of the trap door is

1032
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,839
undetectable and in fact the fake proof

1033
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,960
transcripts

1034
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,960
are indistinguishable from true validly

1035
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,280
generated proof transcripts

1036
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,359
it's probably just a dumb mistake but

1037
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
it's also exactly the kind of mistake

1038
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,480
that a malicious attacker

1039
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,400
would potentially insert in order for it

1040
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,240
to be explained away as a dumb mistake

1041
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
if it was found and in particular it's a

1042
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,799
trapdoor

1043
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,799
for those who like this kind of thing

1044
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
which has a flavor very similar to the

1045
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,520
trapdoor

1046
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:23,359
in the dual ec drbg algorithm there are

1047
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,800
two parameters the system is provably

1048
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,319
hard to manipulate if you if it

1049
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,839
is hard to compute the discrete

1050
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
logarithm of one parameter with

1051
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,839
respect to the other parameter and yet

1052
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,720
these two parameters are allowed to be

1053
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,680
just sort of

1054
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,598
produced without proof that they were

1055
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,680
produced in a way that nobody knows the

1056
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,800
discrete log

1057
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,560
okay so at least in switzerland we were

1058
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,640
talking about a system

1059
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,759
which was being made openly available

1060
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,720
for review

1061
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,400
months before it was intended to be used

1062
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,040
unfortunately the same system

1063
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,640
was already in use in my home country of

1064
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,480
australia in the neighboring state of

1065
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,400
new south wales and this newspaper

1066
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,960
article pretty much sums up the attitude

1067
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,640
it says

1068
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,359
new south wales electoral commission

1069
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,839
confirms i vote contains critical

1070
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,680
societal crypto defect but declares it

1071
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,720
unaffected and safe for upcoming

1072
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,078
election

1073
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,520
so they knew they had the bug but they

1074
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,880
just decided to use it anyway they

1075
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,440
claimed they patched it but of course

1076
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,520
nobody could check

1077
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,520
but surely new south wales has a law

1078
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,640
mandating open public access to the

1079
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,119
source code

1080
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,000
right don't they uh well no actually

1081
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,760
they have a law

1082
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,160
that mandates keeping the source code

1083
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,160
secret

1084
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,319
anyway let's just say for the sake of

1085
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,839
argument that we'd fixed the bug at

1086
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,680
least in switzerland i did

1087
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,279
so now everything is perfectly secure

1088
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,200
right well

1089
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,880
actually the shuffle proof was a

1090
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,720
shuffler decryption proof

1091
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
remember let's have a look at the

1092
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,118
decryption part

1093
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,040
uh turns out there's an equally serious

1094
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,200
bug in the decryption part

1095
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,599
that allows us to fake a decryption

1096
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,759
proof and thus turn a valid vote into

1097
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,640
nonsense while providing an apparently

1098
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,240
verifying

1099
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,279
but completely false proof that we

1100
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,279
decrypted correctly

1101
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,200
this flaw was much more serious for

1102
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,759
switzerland because it affected systems

1103
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,000
that were already in use

1104
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,200
and this got a lot of public attention

1105
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,079
including

1106
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,439
from the swiss federal chancellor who is

1107
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,359
smiling in this photo

1108
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,880
but not happy at all in new south wales

1109
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,160
the electoral commission simply put out

1110
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,160
a press release saying

1111
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,078
that it was not relevant which was not

1112
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,520
true it was immediately obvious

1113
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,079
months after the election when they

1114
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,200
published the code that in fact

1115
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,760
it was highly relevant to them

1116
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,240
so the lessons firstly are that good

1117
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,400
regulations make a huge difference

1118
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,759
switzerland had really detailed

1119
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,520
requirements and really strong

1120
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,079
transparency rules and they found out

1121
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,440
about the problems in their system new

1122
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,440
south wales only noticed there was a

1123
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,920
problem because the swiss transparency

1124
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,320
rules brought new south wales problems

1125
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:03,599
to light so i think internet voting is

1126
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,040
probably going to only seem harder

1127
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,040
the more we try it and the more

1128
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,440
effort we put into understanding the

1129
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
problem

1130
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,280
i think there's a certain brittleness

1131
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,560
about it that makes it really

1132
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,000
hard to guarantee that

1133
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,720
purely cryptographic protections

1134
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,560
are absolutely bulletproof that's why i

1135
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560
really like designs like the election

1136
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,839
guard or starving design that are

1137
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,359
deliberately designed around the

1138
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,320
redundancy of a

1139
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,920
paper audit trail so that even if there

1140
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,160
is something badly wrong with the crypto

1141
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,599
you still have the paper to fall back on

1142
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,839
and i actually think that some of the

1143
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,599
most interesting future directions in

1144
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
this field at least my current favorite

1145
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,760
problem

1146
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,078
is adapting something of that hybrid

1147
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,119
cryptography and paper approach

1148
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,520
to a remote setting with the idea being

1149
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,680
to

1150
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,520
try to approach something that isn't any

1151
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,759
worse than postal voting

1152
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,200
but also perhaps uses some cryptography

1153
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,960
to provide some evidence

1154
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,200
about proper inclusion of the vote

1155
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,200
okay i think that's the end of our

1156
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,680
pre-recorded

1157
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,040
presentations i hope that everybody's

1158
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,279
getting used to this format

1159
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,560
i know that it's new for me new way to

1160
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,880
do conferences

1161
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,799
i'm happy to tell you i just bought this

1162
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,119
privacy screen that you see behind me so

1163
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,400
you no longer have to see

1164
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,960
what you don't want to know what's back

1165
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,200
there anyway um and

1166
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,000
i see other new things about this format

1167
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,240
for example

1168
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,240
alex and ben commenting and not paying

1169
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,078
attention during their own talks

1170
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,598
and and talking to people on the slack

1171
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,640
which i thought was great

1172
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,240
um and so i want to share with you a

1173
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,960
quick thing that happened to me

1174
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,520
and lead into my first question and then

1175
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,599
after

1176
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,040
the panelists can address my question

1177
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,480
i've been copy pasting

1178
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,079
uh some of the questions that are

1179
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,599
showing up on slack and i'll present

1180
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,760
those to the panelists

1181
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,960
so what happened to me is during this

1182
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
covet time

1183
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,320
my family and i are living in another

1184
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,160
house not in our

1185
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,839
in our house that we normally live in

1186
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,920
and we forwarded our mail

1187
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,000
to this new house and then when it came

1188
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,920
to time to vote in the primary we had

1189
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,119
requested absentee ballots because of

1190
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,480
coveted we didn't want to go to the

1191
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,640
polling place

1192
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,240
and we never got the absentee ballots

1193
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,160
and we called up the board of elections

1194
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,640
and it turns out that they won't forward

1195
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,440
ballots um if you have male forwarding

1196
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,200
and so

1197
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,560
as someone who cares about voting as one

1198
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,680
of my favorite absolute things in the

1199
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,560
whole world

1200
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,040
i didn't get to vote in the primary and

1201
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,640
so now

1202
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
what i've done for the general election

1203
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,319
is cancelled mail forwarding and

1204
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,079
driving back and forth between the

1205
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,920
houses to get the mail it's about an

1206
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,119
hour drive but i definitely want to make

1207
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,200
sure i get to vote

1208
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,319
so the question i have is what can we do

1209
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,640
to make vote by mail

1210
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,520
more secure and what can we do to

1211
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,160
increase

1212
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,720
people's confidence in vote by mail and

1213
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,359
there was also a question on the list

1214
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,560
from a participant here about uh the

1215
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,000
chain of custody

1216
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,078
of a paper ballot so uh whoever

1217
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,599
wants to take that uh you if you go

1218
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,839
first you win unmute

1219
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,839
and uh i will mute while you instead

1220
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,919
if you touch your nose then you don't

1221
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,839
have to answer and so i i'm happy to go

1222
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,839
first

1223
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,440
um i think

1224
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,720
the main thing i'll say about vote by

1225
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
mail the main thing that everyone should

1226
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,439
understand about vote by mail

1227
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,440
is that um there's you know

1228
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,880
when kovitz started people were like oh

1229
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
that's fine everybody will just vote by

1230
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,079
mail

1231
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,440
no big deal uh turns out operating a

1232
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,760
vote by mail election

1233
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,280
is fairly complex and you've got all

1234
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,319
sorts of edge cases like the one you

1235
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,440
just mentioned

1236
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,560
right where people move or the election

1237
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,480
office doesn't actually have

1238
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,000
your latest address on record because if

1239
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,680
you're vote used to voting in person

1240
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,040
they don't strictly need your latest

1241
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,879
address on record it's not the end of

1242
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,640
the world if you come in and say

1243
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,240
i live at one two three easy street and

1244
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,920
they go no that's not what i have and

1245
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,640
you go oh you probably have like four

1246
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,800
five six

1247
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,839
blue street yes okay good that's me and

1248
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,280
i can go on right

1249
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,359
so the records don't have to be up to

1250
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,800
date if you're voting in person but they

1251
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,799
really have to be up to date

1252
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,480
if you're voting by mail that's just one

1253
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,920
of the many many issues so i think how

1254
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,839
do you get good at vote by mail

1255
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,520
practice practice practice you know and

1256
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,960
this is one of the

1257
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,640
dangers that alex mentioned when we're

1258
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,319
rapidly ramping up vote by mail we don't

1259
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,799
get to practice practice practice

1260
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,920
and so it's going to be hard right it's

1261
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,200
going to be really hard

1262
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,640
another thing i'll mention that we've

1263
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,160
spent a lot of time looking into this at

1264
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,480
voting works this year

1265
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:38,879
is the vote by mail world has not been

1266
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,839
productized by that i mean every county

1267
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,560
goes off and builds their own vote by

1268
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,078
mail product

1269
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,680
now there are some resources they can

1270
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,680
make use of that are fantastic

1271
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,118
the center for civic design has envelope

1272
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,680
designs that you can borrow

1273
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,720
the the folks in colorado and the vote

1274
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,960
at home folks

1275
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,480
have produced best practices and

1276
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,960
timelines and whatnot that are

1277
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,160
really fantastic but if you're a county

1278
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,800
and you want to

1279
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,359
deploy vote by mail at scale you have to

1280
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
go

1281
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,160
and take those resources but then you

1282
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,599
still have to kind of assemble all the

1283
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,200
components by yourself

1284
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,200
one of the things that we've been

1285
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,720
working on building and voting works and

1286
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,319
unfortunately it won't be ready to

1287
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,319
significantly help this year but we're

1288
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,480
hoping it'll be ready in future years

1289
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,920
is the ability for a county to sign up

1290
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,720
with us or with somebody else who wants

1291
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,640
to offer this

1292
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,720
and very rapidly get all the best

1293
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,319
practices implemented and deployed

1294
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,160
in vote by mail it's not going to solve

1295
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,520
everything but if you saw the gantt

1296
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,440
charts that counties have to go through

1297
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,560
right now to deploy vote by mail

1298
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,760
it's it's just so many places

1299
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,920
that they have to implement a new

1300
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,119
process and so many places to fail so

1301
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,520
i'll pause there well i and i let me

1302
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,640
follow up because i absolutely agree

1303
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,480
with ben that the

1304
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,160
biggest challenges we have with vote by

1305
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,280
mail now are logistical

1306
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,319
or just getting uh to the point where

1307
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,480
large numbers of people are familiar

1308
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:59,119
with the process where jurisdictions

1309
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,560
um have the necessary procedures in

1310
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,880
place etc

1311
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,680
but thinking as a as a security problem

1312
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,119
a little bit more

1313
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,480
we know from past prosecutions

1314
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,800
of um electoral fraud that a lot of it

1315
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,000
does happen with absentee ballots

1316
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,280
but um as i said in my talk the number

1317
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,079
of cases that have been

1318
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,760
prosecuted or probably in the high

1319
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,440
hundreds in recent years

1320
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,200
uh we're not talking about things where

1321
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,680
we have any evidence that

1322
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,759
fraud takes place on a scale of millions

1323
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,279
and the main reason for that seems to be

1324
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,359
that the attacks have to be

1325
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,599
retail level that is you're attacking

1326
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,880
one ballot at a time

1327
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,880
um on the other hand there is a um

1328
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,040
kind of central point of failure in boat

1329
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,079
by mail too which is the post office

1330
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,319
itself

1331
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,240
which is a kind of large and complex

1332
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,000
system with its own dependence on

1333
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,598
technology and certainly on

1334
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,240
administrative processes

1335
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,920
and on the um correct functioning of

1336
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,839
government

1337
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,480
so if we think of the postal service

1338
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,960
itself as a point of attack

1339
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,520
i think that could be a major weakness

1340
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,800
in

1341
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,839
vote by mail systems and uh even now as

1342
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,119
we're witnessing

1343
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:15,839
um problems with reports of cascading

1344
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,760
delays and mail delivery and so forth

1345
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,440
um you could model that as a kind of

1346
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,599
denial of service attack against

1347
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,880
participation through the mail

1348
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,680
and um i i think we're likely to see

1349
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,800
um potential problems with computerized

1350
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,359
mail processing

1351
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,160
as well become a potential for

1352
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,598
vulnerability

1353
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,920
and vote by mail one concern that i have

1354
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,319
is

1355
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,920
i see on you know the social media

1356
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,079
jungle out there

1357
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,040
claims that the delays that we're seeing

1358
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,079
in the postal

1359
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,839
mail are intentional and um i think

1360
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,880
we're just headed for an election whose

1361
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,359
result

1362
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,200
uh the losing side is going to blame

1363
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,920
anything they possibly can and they may

1364
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,879
say that

1365
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,359
the postal system was sabotaged um on

1366
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,200
purpose

1367
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,560
in order to hurt the election where

1368
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,118
there were going to be a lot more than

1369
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,400
usual

1370
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,240
uh vote by mail so let's

1371
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,920
let's move on from there to another

1372
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,118
question i'll ask one more question and

1373
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,800
then i'll i'll start with the

1374
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,119
participant questions so

1375
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,040
uh ben would it make sense and i i

1376
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,119
didn't think i heard you mention this

1377
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,319
um you know how sometimes you're in a

1378
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,400
store and you want to know how much

1379
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,200
something costs and it has a barcode on

1380
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,119
it so you just

1381
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,640
walk up to the machine and you have it

1382
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,200
scan the barcode and it shows you the

1383
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,799
price

1384
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,240
and i was thinking with the ballots that

1385
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,440
you have that have the bar code in the

1386
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,439
top right

1387
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,040
if you could have at the polls such a

1388
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
machine that had a display

1389
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,960
you could just take the bar code and and

1390
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,839
have it read it and display it now yes

1391
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,200
you could argue

1392
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,359
if somebody were cheating they would

1393
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,319
cheat there but maybe this is built to

1394
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,560
some known spec

1395
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,599
by an independent party and this would

1396
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,799
be a way to increase

1397
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,800
people's confidence yeah um

1398
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,040
so first i won't answer your question

1399
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,520
then i will answer your question

1400
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,720
so uh by now i'm not going to answer

1401
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,280
your question by saying

1402
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,480
uh we found the qr code is scary to

1403
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,440
voters

1404
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,920
if it is prominent and that's all they

1405
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
see

1406
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,280
right and there are a lot of ballots out

1407
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,599
there that like have a giant qr code

1408
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,640
and then tiny little font underneath it

1409
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,560
so it looks like

1410
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,400
there's like a qr code and then some

1411
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,400
dirt on your ballot right and that's

1412
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,760
that's like that's legitimately scary

1413
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,280
and then they wonder what it is

1414
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,040
we've tried in our design to make the

1415
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,000
font significantly more prominent and

1416
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,680
the qr code is there

1417
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,520
and they see it but it's not in the way

1418
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,118
so is that a security answer

1419
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,880
no not really because it doesn't change

1420
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,440
the security model right

1421
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,920
but but when voters are worried that's

1422
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,359
that's

1423
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,200
the main reason they're worried about it

1424
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,400
and thinking about the design actually

1425
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,240
influences

1426
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,319
the outcome because you want voters to

1427
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,479
trust it and then the trust is actually

1428
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,160
engendered by the rla on the back end

1429
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,240
right which is which is how you get it

1430
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,920
could you do what you described yes

1431
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,118
absolutely like i said i think on the

1432
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,400
security front you know

1433
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,319
both machines are coming out of voting

1434
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,559
work it's like oh well great you just

1435
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,400
you know like you can cheat one way and

1436
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,240
cheat the same way in the machine right

1437
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,760
and then putting it in open spec makes a

1438
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,359
ton of sense

1439
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,760
the only thing you have to keep in mind

1440
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,359
is that there are many ballot styles

1441
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,119
there are many election definitions

1442
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,799
a lot of these qr codes contain a highly

1443
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,559
compressed version of the data because

1444
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,440
they can't contain the whole election

1445
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,119
definition

1446
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,640
and so you'd have to have the election

1447
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,040
definition uh

1448
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,558
to be able to map that against that and

1449
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,079
so what you need then is

1450
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,920
interoperable data formats for

1451
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,400
everything for the election and all that

1452
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,720
stuff

1453
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,920
there is a lot of great work going on uh

1454
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,598
coming out of nist on

1455
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,680
the common data formats that would

1456
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,359
enable this kind of stuff and i'm i'm a

1457
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,118
huge proponent of that so

1458
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,558
yes to your idea but there's a lot of

1459
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,280
steps to get there that aren't

1460
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,559
there yet sure well and avi one of the

1461
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,760
problems is in

1462
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,680
um many voting machines many bmds that

1463
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,559
are used now that barcode is

1464
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,558
actually encrypted so that um you as the

1465
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,079
voter even if you had your own device to

1466
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,000
scan it or whatever

1467
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,359
um you probably wouldn't be able to make

1468
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,680
any sense of it

1469
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,839
so even beyond it just being coded now

1470
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,640
that doesn't necessarily need to be that

1471
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,680
way

1472
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,400
but i i i think i agree with um ben in

1473
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,520
in in part and and strongly disagree in

1474
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,079
another part and i

1475
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,440
we both agree that um as long as there's

1476
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,440
human readable text

1477
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,800
it's verified by the voter and it's

1478
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,119
strongly audited

1479
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,319
then any problem is going to be is going

1480
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,559
to get caught

1481
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,520
and um that's ultimately i think where

1482
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
we need to

1483
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,040
get to in order to have strong

1484
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,078
confidence

1485
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:31,200
in uh election integrity now

1486
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,680
where i i disagree is as an

1487
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,720
and interim matter so we have the

1488
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,799
problem that there are many

1489
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,640
jurisdictions now that are using bmds

1490
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,599
for all voters and are not performing

1491
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,118
and audit

1492
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,280
and what this means if there are

1493
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,559
barcode-based bmds

1494
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,720
is that um an attack against the bmds

1495
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,559
that changes the barcode or an attack

1496
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,279
against the scanner that changes the

1497
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,960
count

1498
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,920
um would would both be a route that was

1499
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,200
able to change

1500
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,280
the um the final counts um

1501
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,200
so instead of having just one vulnerable

1502
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,880
system or potentially vulnerable system

1503
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,439
to attack now you have your choice of

1504
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,359
two

1505
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,359
and that seems to me to be materially

1506
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,200
worse

1507
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,799
i'll add one thing but i will note that

1508
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,879
we are crowding out our co-panelist

1509
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,040
vanessa lewis

1510
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,319
i was actually going to address the next

1511
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,240
question the first uh

1512
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,599
audience questions let me have one quick

1513
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,000
quick little detail and then i'll shut

1514
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,920
up for

1515
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
i promise i think the one thing that's

1516
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,160
like obvious with a qr code is you could

1517
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,440
mess with the qr code and and alex is

1518
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
completely right you could mess with the

1519
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,599
qr code

1520
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,200
the part that's less obvious and i try

1521
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,160
to say it in the talk but it's so hard

1522
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,919
to convey

1523
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,759
is you can mess with the timing marks

1524
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,920
and the printing of bubble balance too

1525
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,359
right and i don't know if it's happened

1526
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,559
uh on purpose but it certainly has

1527
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,000
happened by accident

1528
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,760
where ballots have been printed where

1529
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,960
bubbles are not quite perfectly aligned

1530
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,280
with the timing marks

1531
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,200
and it leads to significant undercount

1532
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,559
of votes and the only time those have

1533
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,240
been detected by the way

1534
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,160
is when the printing is so off that a

1535
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,598
candidate gets like three votes

1536
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,279
out of a hundred thousand and then they

1537
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,720
go well something must have gone wrong

1538
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,400
and they go back to the ballots and

1539
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,160
they detect it but if it's off by a

1540
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,160
little bit and maybe a

1541
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,359
candidate loses five to ten percent you

1542
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,160
would never catch that

1543
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,839
without an audit right and uh and so i

1544
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,440
know the qr code is scarier

1545
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,359
and i know that it you know the fact

1546
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,359
that it's like printed on demand

1547
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,520
might feel like it's an additional

1548
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,359
threat compared to the pre-printed stuff

1549
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,960
but remember the pre-printed ballots are

1550
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,319
outsourced to private printing firms

1551
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,920
that are usually local

1552
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,520
they could easily inject five or ten

1553
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,040
percent mistake in that stack

1554
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,800
you wouldn't know if it's a bubble is

1555
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,160
slightly off so i'll now

1556
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,920
be quiet for a while even if alex

1557
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,598
responds i'll still be quiet

1558
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,200
actually let me cut it off let's go to

1559
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,800
vanessa i mean we could

1560
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,720
we could talk for hours and in fact we

1561
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,559
have questions later about the barcodes

1562
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,240
but next question we're going to take

1563
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,040
i'm going to direct it to vanessa i

1564
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,240
think it's a

1565
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,720
actually fits well with what you were

1566
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,720
talking about a bit um it's from

1567
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,919
um i hope i'm not butchering this name

1568
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,078
too badly phoebe

1569
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,000
rouge uh who is from the federal trade

1570
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,160
commission in dc

1571
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,119
and i'll just read it a more general

1572
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,799
question i

1573
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,240
wonder how the pressure to return

1574
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,160
results quickly

1575
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,640
with delays potentially causing the

1576
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,640
legitimacy to be called into question

1577
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,160
trades off with the time needed to check

1578
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,240
that the results are correct

1579
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,799
as in do some election officials use the

1580
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,520
time needed to do audits as a reason not

1581
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,000
to do them

1582
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,920
or do them less thoroughly or prefer a

1583
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,040
less auditable technology versus a

1584
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,480
faster one

1585
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,680
provide aggregate results

1586
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,839
yeah i think that's a really good

1587
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,680
question and i think the

1588
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,520
discussion that i've seen is actually

1589
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,480
really sad in

1590
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:38,720
that speed seems to be valued very very

1591
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,160
highly when really accuracy is the thing

1592
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,598
that should be valued

1593
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,000
i've seen this in lots and lots of

1594
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,480
different countries in particular the

1595
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
australian electoral commission

1596
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,760
is very resistant to doing audits

1597
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,119
and they say quite openly that they're

1598
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,880
not keen to do it because they know it

1599
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,960
would slow down the process

1600
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,400
and i say well yes of course it would

1601
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,079
slow down the process

1602
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,319
and you'd get much higher confidence in

1603
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,040
the accuracy of your election result

1604
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,240
right uh but unfortunately that's not

1605
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,480
the universal view

1606
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,759
i do know of at least one example in

1607
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,440
which

1608
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,480
uh suspicious speed was regarded as

1609
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,839
uh yeah too much speed was regarded as

1610
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,240
suspicious i have some

1611
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,880
uh students and friends who came from

1612
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,558
iran

1613
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,960
after the very contested election they

1614
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,400
had their backing i think it was 2012.

1615
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,160
and they said one of the things that was

1616
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,040
really suspicious about that election

1617
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,440
was that the

1618
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,720
answer was announced too quickly so

1619
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,400
nobody really believed that they'd

1620
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,598
actually counted the ballots

1621
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,920
so uh overall i think both in australia

1622
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,160
and

1623
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,559
i gather in the united states there's a

1624
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,759
belief that fast election results are a

1625
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,920
good thing and that they

1626
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,440
they indicate something positive about

1627
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,119
integrity when in fact exactly the

1628
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,520
opposite is true i think we should

1629
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,040
really encourage a tolerance or indeed a

1630
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,400
requirement for

1631
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,079
slow and careful checking of the results

1632
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,559
and if you do steal the election build

1633
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,760
in a delay so they don't think that you

1634
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,280
just faked it all i don't know does any

1635
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,680
of the other panelists want to comment

1636
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,680
about this

1637
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,319
um so let me we're gonna have we're

1638
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,920
gonna have delayed results in the u.s

1639
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,558
this year because of vote by mail

1640
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,280
just just know that right like that that

1641
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,520
is

1642
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,040
inescapa there's a very strong chance we

1643
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,200
won't know the winner the night of the

1644
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,440
election or even the next day

1645
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,200
yeah i and you know it's happened a few

1646
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,319
times in our presidential elections

1647
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,839
already so

1648
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,599
uh maybe we're gonna start getting used

1649
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,400
to that and and i don't

1650
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,480
i think we should be careful not to um

1651
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,240
demand that any of the candidates commit

1652
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,119
to accepting the results

1653
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,919
immediately after um election night

1654
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,960
because uh

1655
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,079
it probably will be true

1656
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,000
that uh some results not only will come

1657
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,599
in late but some results may have to be

1658
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,079
challenged and further scrutinized

1659
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,280
before

1660
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,280
we know for sure what the outcome was

1661
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,319
okay this next question is from jenny

1662
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,279
blessing

1663
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,520
and it is how do we overcome barriers to

1664
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,040
access in doing technical evaluations of

1665
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,559
electrician systems

1666
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,240
private vendors are notoriously

1667
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,280
resistant to allowing security

1668
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,279
researchers

1669
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,640
access to their systems since they have

1670
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,200
little incentive to encourage

1671
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,799
potentially damaging security reports

1672
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,118
which means that they are entire

1673
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,880
sections of the election ecosystem

1674
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,240
like equal books that have never been

1675
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,760
publicly looked at

1676
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:35,040
what would be some of the first step

1677
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:38,400
towards encouraging vendor cooperation

1678
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,558
boy um can i can i start that i guess

1679
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,799
um the uh we we've seen one small but

1680
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,799
encouraging step just this past week

1681
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,960
where esns one of the big vendors

1682
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,680
finally did

1683
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,680
adopt a vulnerability disclosure policy

1684
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,000
in which they promised not to sue people

1685
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,078
who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities

1686
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,240
in their systems

1687
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,640
now there's still no way to get access

1688
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,720
to their current voting systems

1689
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:09,598
um so you might think that this is moot

1690
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,558
but it's still at least symbolically a

1691
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,160
positive step

1692
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,079
because hopefully it will encourage

1693
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,480
other election vendors to

1694
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,000
follow suit and we can maybe turn down

1695
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,880
the temperature a little bit

1696
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,319
in the room when it comes to cooperation

1697
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,319
between the security

1698
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:28,880
universe and uh major election vendors

1699
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:31,200
um personally though i i do think it

1700
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,599
should be easier for

1701
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,359
researchers to to get access to voting

1702
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,480
machines i mean of course we want there

1703
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:40,319
to be

1704
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:43,839
additional scrutiny now whether that

1705
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,680
is going to be making machines available

1706
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,000
to just anyone who wants to look at them

1707
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,480
i

1708
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,200
i i don't know that that might well

1709
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,240
increase

1710
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,680
security risks in the short term um

1711
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,520
but at least through some kind of

1712
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,558
cooperative program with

1713
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,839
known institutions and researchers um

1714
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:04,960
i i think we could get much better

1715
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,680
at um soliciting the help and

1716
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,280
really the um the the often free

1717
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,359
penetration testing

1718
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,440
uh that comes from thorough security

1719
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,359
scrutiny

1720
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,799
yeah i completely agree with alex uh i'm

1721
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:20,400
much more uh

1722
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,160
um of an extremist on this one

1723
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,920
uh at votingworks everything we do is

1724
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,640
open source and on our github right now

1725
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,839
you can go get all of our source code

1726
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,200
and we could probably spend more time

1727
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,920
documenting how you would build it all

1728
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,520
onto

1729
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,280
the right hardware and we will but the

1730
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,040
point is um i

1731
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,119
we are trying to set an example that

1732
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,400
everything related to elections should

1733
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,839
be fully transparent

1734
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,760
we do not make claims nor do we uh

1735
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,359
nor would we ever i would ever want us

1736
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,280
to make claims that the open source

1737
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,480
aspect guarantees security that's not

1738
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,960
how it works right because you still

1739
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,319
have to

1740
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,160
know that the right code is installed in

1741
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,400
the machine and all that stuff right

1742
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,240
but that level of transparency both in

1743
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,440
how machines are operated and how they

1744
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,240
and how they run uh i strongly believe

1745
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,359
should be

1746
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,879
uh how we do things uh i'd like i think

1747
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,040
the you know the fellow government and

1748
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,280
the states you know california does have

1749
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
a

1750
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,640
mandatory disclosure policy for things

1751
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,599
that are systems that are certified in

1752
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,040
california

1753
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,040
uh it's not the same thing as giving

1754
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,079
alex and his students access to hardware

1755
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,240
to test right

1756
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,359
but it is a step in the direction of

1757
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,879
disclosure and

1758
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,558
and and that kind of thing and i i think

1759
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,599
there's the states and the federal

1760
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,160
government could do more

1761
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,440
in this front but there's one more

1762
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,598
important

1763
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,599
one more important point which is that

1764
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,000
um if we got to

1765
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,079
the place where both i think all of us

1766
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,760
would like to see election technology

1767
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,880
where you have a physical record and

1768
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,079
it's audited

1769
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,559
then the reliance on the secure

1770
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,400
state of the voting machine itself is

1771
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,640
significantly reduced

1772
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,400
maybe to the point where um there's

1773
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,920
there's a lot less need for such

1774
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,079
scrutiny um if we don't have if we're um

1775
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,400
manually verifying that the outcome is

1776
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,319
correct then yes there's still a risk to

1777
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,599
privacy or of uh

1778
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,359
uh of denial of service um but the

1779
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,400
incentive to attack the voting machines

1780
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,839
in the first place

1781
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,640
would be much less so unfortunately

1782
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,240
i i have um a dozen or so great

1783
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,078
questions that i was dying to read to

1784
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,520
you from the participants but we have

1785
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,760
less than a minute left

1786
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,200
this is obviously a really hot topic and

1787
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,640
there's another presentation coming

1788
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,118
right on the heels of ours

1789
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,920
so i'll let you stay in and give 10

1790
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,400
seconds

1791
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,119
some final words and then uh we'll have

1792
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,760
to thank everybody and uh let us next

1793
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,640
move on

1794
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,559
so go ahead uh maybe in the same order

1795
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,319
you spoke before 10 seconds

1796
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,200
i yield my time to vanessa i spoke too

1797
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:45,200
much go vanessa yield

1798
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,720
verifiability is everything i think you

1799
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,078
have to be directly checking

1800
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,399
the uh election result in a ca oh and

1801
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,319
the

1802
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,440
verification process itself has to be

1803
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,119
completely transparent

1804
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,960
too so a bunch of observers should be

1805
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,559
allowed to stand around and watch

1806
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,160
that the verification process is

1807
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,799
happening all right

1808
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,720
i will say this was a fantastic panel to

1809
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,759
a set of panelists to work with it was a

1810
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,759
great topic

1811
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,240
i really enjoyed it i hope next year to

1812
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:15,839
see you in person all of you somewhere

1813
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,839
and thank you very much bye
