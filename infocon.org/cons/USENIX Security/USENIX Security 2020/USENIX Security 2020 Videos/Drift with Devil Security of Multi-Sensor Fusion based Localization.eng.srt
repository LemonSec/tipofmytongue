hi everyone

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
today i will present our work drifter

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,239
with devil

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
security of multisensor fusion-based

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,960
localization

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,480
in high level of homes driving on the

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,720
gps roofing

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,600
my name is string jason me and my

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,320
co-authors

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,840
are all from asgard research group or

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,840
our tom system guard group

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,238
at the uc irvine under my advisor

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,079
as many of you are already aware the

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,120
autumn's vehicles are finally

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,760
on public roads for example the pictures

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
on the right

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,399
are taken at the irvine where you can

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
get free rides of self-driving taxis

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,920
by simply typing on your smartphone

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
however

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,879
many of us still have concerns about the

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,680
safety of this brand new technology

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,960
especially when the safety issues can be

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,879
deliberately triggered by the attacker

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,719
before i jump into our attack let's

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,319
first take a look at the internals

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,840
of an av typically a level 4 av comes

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,960
with a lot of sensors

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,520
such as lidar gps imu

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,280
this sensor inputs will be passed to an

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,560
autopsy driving system

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,200
or ad system to make driving decisions

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
for example localization module uses

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
sensor inputs

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,280
to estimate the current position of the

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,600
vehicle

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
perception module then use the sensor

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,280
inputs and

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
the localization outputs to detect the

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,000
surrounding obstacles

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
next planning module will calculate an

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
optimal driving trajectory

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,040
based on the obstacles and the v

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,600
composition

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
finally the control module enforces this

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
plan

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
by correcting any deviation between the

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,360
localization output

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,680
and the planet trajectory localization

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,560
is critical to the safety of av

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
if localization is inaccurate the output

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
of localization

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
will have some division to the actual

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,759
position of the vehicle

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,640
because of the control module these

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,680
deviations will be directly reflected

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
in the physical position of the av and

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
if the division is large enough

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
it can cause the av to drive off-road to

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,399
hit the road

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,760
curb or even onto a runway to crash

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,319
into another vehicle for e-d

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,920
localization gps is the de facto

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,560
location input

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,519
however it is well known that gps is

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,720
susceptible

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,480
to gps moving attacks where the attacker

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
sets arbitrary position

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,518
by sending fake satellite signals gps

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,000
spoofing is still an open problem

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
because the lack of authentication

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,840
and it has been demonstrated to be

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,239
practical on a lot of enemy systems

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,640
in fact gps spoofing activities are

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,519
becoming more pervasive recently

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,040
last year it is reported that over 9 000

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,360
spoofing activities

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,599
are identified in russia since february

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
2016.

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,720
fortunately for 80 systems gps is not

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
the only positioning source

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
instead they widely atop a multisense

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,879
fusion

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
or msf based design as in commercial ad

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,560
systems

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,920
and studied in many research works

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,959
different sensors have different

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,359
properties

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,640
so the core idea behind the msf is to

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,080
leverage the strength and the

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,559
compensated weakness

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
of these sensors to generally improve

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,799
the accuracy

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,840
and the robustness so far the most

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,840
popular msf

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,000
fuses sensor data from gps lidar and imu

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
and the state of the art one can achieve

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
localization accuracy

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,640
as small as 5.4 centimeter as we can see

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,519
in msf gps alone can no longer dictate

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
the localization results and that is why

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
msf is generally believed

103
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,480
to have the potential to defend against

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,480
the gps moving

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,239
however none of these fireworks studied

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,959
whether state-of-the-art msf algorithms

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
are indeed sufficiently secure under gps

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
spoofing

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
in our work we are the first to explore

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,200
this highly critical

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,519
but completely unexplored problem space

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,879
according to our study the short answer

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,399
to this is no

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
as long as the spoofing is done

115
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,959
strategically

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
first let me show you an end-to-end demo

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
of the attack discovered in our work

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,080
coefficient ripper

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
we created this attack demo using an ad

120
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,359
simulator

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,759
and the end to end by the apollo 80

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
system

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
here the left side is the msf view

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
and the right side is the physical world

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
view

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,479
the red circles are the lighter

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,479
positions

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
and the blue circles are the gps

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
positions

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,040
and the green circles are the msf output

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,199
which is where the victim thinks in the

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
locates

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
and on the right is the physical word

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,240
position this is where the victim

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
actually is

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:25,840
first let's see how the victim av drives

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:25,840
without any attack

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:38,240
we can see that the victim safely went

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:53,840
through the track lane

140
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:53,840
next is with our vision reaper attack

141
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
here the attacker started the first

142
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
stage of the attack

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,680
i will talk about the attack details in

144
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,679
the later slides

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,319
now the attacker starts the second stage

146
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,479
of the attack

147
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,720
as we can see the attacker drags away

148
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,880
the msf output to the left

149
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,720
and causes the victim to deviate to the

150
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,560
right in the physical world

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
and finally hit the stop sign

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,720
now let's take a look at the details of

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,318
our research

154
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
we formulated the problem as the

155
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
attackers with gps

156
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,560
inputs with certain distances to

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
victim's physical position

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
attacker tries to maximize the level

159
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,520
deviation

160
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,600
in the msf output compared to no attack

161
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,120
in this figure the attackers spoofs the

162
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,360
gps to deviate the msf to the right

163
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,039
but because of the control module the

164
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,840
physical position of the vehicle

165
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,360
is actually deviating to the left then

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,039
in terms of the attack goal

167
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
the attacker tries to introduce a

168
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,919
deviation that is large enough

169
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,520
to cause the victim to drive off-road or

170
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,840
onto a runway

171
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,080
in this work we call them off-road and

172
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,239
runway attacks

173
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
as the first step we did a security

174
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,039
analysis to understand the security

175
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,639
properties of

176
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,159
msf in this analysis we aim to find the

177
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,360
maximum possible deviation

178
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,599
that can be achieved by gps spoofing

179
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,400
our analysis target is the production

180
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,440
grade by the apollo msf which is

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,239
representative

182
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,080
in both design and implementation for

183
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
our security analysis

184
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,520
we find that msf can indeed improve the

185
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,680
security against the gps moving

186
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,960
however we also find a very interesting

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
takeover effect

188
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,878
which can cause an exponential growth

189
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,840
trend of the deviations

190
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,319
as one showing in this figure in such

191
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
case

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
the spoofed gps inputs become the

193
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,440
dominating source to the phishing

194
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
process

195
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,800
and can even make the msf algorithm to

196
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,599
drop the data from all other sources

197
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,599
this is why we call it a takeover effect

198
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
which fundamentally defeats the design

199
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,440
principle

200
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,840
of multi-sensor fusion we then did a

201
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,479
statistical causality analysis

202
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,080
and i find that such a takeover effect

203
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,199
is created by some

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,840
dynamic and non-deterministic factors

205
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,440
such as sensitive noises and algorithm

206
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,599
inaccuracies

207
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
this makes it difficult for the attacker

208
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
to predict

209
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,000
or control such vulnerability to

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
overcome this

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,760
the attacker has to exploit it in an

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,320
optimistic way

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
to do that we design fusion ripper which

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,159
is a two-stage attack

215
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,640
with a vulnerability profiling stage and

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,200
an aggressive spoofing stage

217
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,480
here is an illustration of this attack

218
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
in the first stage

219
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,200
the attacker tries to find out where the

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,719
vulnerable period appears

221
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
after finding out such a vulnerable

222
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,040
period the attacker launched the second

223
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
stage

224
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
to aggressively spoof the gps in order

225
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,719
to take over the msf

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,560
and cause large deviations

227
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
we evaluated the attack on six

228
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,800
real-world sensor traces

229
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
we find that there always exists at

230
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,839
least one attack parameter

231
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,839
that can achieve over 95 success rates

232
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
to cause lane departure or wrong way

233
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
driving

234
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,800
it is also pretty fast with only about

235
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,040
30 seconds to succeed on average

236
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
we also find that our attack is robust

237
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
to practical attack considerations

238
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,839
such as spoofing inaccuracies and ad

239
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,160
control

240
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,320
also did more extensive evaluations such

241
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,800
as abolition study

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
generality analysis comparisons with

243
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
naive attacks

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,399
and also black box attack designs please

245
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,160
refer to our paper for more details

246
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
there are two general directions to

247
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,319
defend against the fusion ripper

248
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,279
first is to fundamentally prevent the

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
attack by either prevent gps spoofing

250
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,040
or improving the sensor and the

251
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,120
localization technologies

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,279
however currently these fundamental

253
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,560
solutions are not immediately

254
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,079
deployable second and the more

255
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,319
actionable mitigation

256
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,760
is to apply attack detection and the

257
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,399
emergency stop

258
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,200
for example using gps moving detection

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,360
or camera-based lane detection

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
such a solution is still limited though

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,399
for example it can still cause denial of

262
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,040
service of the av

263
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,200
operation but we think it's still better

264
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
than directly causing the safety damages

265
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,120
that we have shown

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,880
earlier we did a responsible probability

267
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,760
disclosure to the av companies

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
after this paper is accepted as of july

269
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,959
20th

270
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,240
we have informed the 29 companies which

271
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,119
are developing or testing level for avs

272
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
among them 16 have replied and study the

273
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
investigation

274
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,079
and one company is currently working on

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,079
a fix

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,199
to conclude we performed the first

277
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,239
security analysis

278
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,440
on msf-based ad localization on the gps

279
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
moving

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
we discovered a typical vulnerability

281
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,560
which fundamentally defeats

282
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,640
the design principle of msf

283
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
we designed a concrete attack called

284
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,640
fission repair

285
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,399
to opportunistically capture and exploit

286
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
this vulnerability

287
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
we also designed an offline profiling

288
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,680
method to improve the attack

289
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,079
practicality

290
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,439
finally we have informed the 29 av

291
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560
companies regarding this

292
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
issue with that i want to thank you for

293
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:42,399
your attention

294
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:42,399
and i'm open to any questions
