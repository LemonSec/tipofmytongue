00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
hi

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,320
in this talk i present the non-existing

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,919
nameserver attack

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,960
for the attack recursive dns

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,800
inefficiencies and vulnerabilities the

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,720
joint work of utah fake

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,800
anna bremner barr and leo shafir

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
we'll have a quick overview of some

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
elements of the dns

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
which are critical for the attack we'll

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,760
see some variations of the attack

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,079
discuss some mitigation options go over

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,079
the responsible disclosure procedure we

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
followed and conclude the remark

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
attack itself received possible amount

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,360
of attention from the media

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,480
including zidane wild fox news

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
and many other news media agencies we

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,319
tested the attack on the

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
following dns implementations all of

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
them have been found to be vulnerable

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
and on the following dns service

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
providers

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,399
again the following has been found

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,720
vulnerable

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
as you know without the dns they see the

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,640
internet is useless

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
when the dns is under a massive attack

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
and doesn't function

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,798
the affected areas cannot access clients

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,439
and the fact that they cannot access

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
their shopping their online email the

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,798
chat

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,119
zoom nothing is available this page is

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,840
what you'll get for any resource you try

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,280
to reach on the internet

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
the daily system envisioned in 1987 by

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,840
paul mccarpetris

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
consists of more than 10 million servers

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
two major types the authoritative

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
servers

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,398
arranged in hierarchical structure and

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
recursive resolver mediating between

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,840
clients

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
and the assorted servers when a client

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,600
wishes

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,840
to find the iphones of cs not just

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,399
related edu for example

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,680
it accesses its associated recursive

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,280
disorder

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
with an empty cache the recursive

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
resolver as they would what's the ideas

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
of ces

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,119
or juicy lay.edu which responds i'm not

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,720
authority for this name

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,680
for this domain name you may ask dot edu

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,840
it may get you closer to the answer

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
dotted you respond similarly i'm not

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,920
assaulted before

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,959
ucla would eat you but you should ask

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
the name server at ucla.edu

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,760
asking this name server which is

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,920
responsible for all resources at ucla

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,799
you get a response with the required by

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,839
peerness

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,640
and you can now access the required

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,319
resource

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,000
we see three packet exchanges for one

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,280
resolution request the system has

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
several requirements

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
the major ones are high availability

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,920
when it's not available the affected

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,879
parts cannot reach resources on the

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,119
internet

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,359
and quick response time because any

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
delay is added to the latency

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
of reaching resources on the internet of

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
course

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,319
high efficiency and making sure the

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,920
responses are authentic

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,079
the high availability and the quick

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,040
response time are the key drivers for

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
our attack high availability means that

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,640
if

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,560
a name server is not reachable you must

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
find alternative ways because now you

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
cannot reach any resource yet for

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,000
example ucla.edu

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
therefore all associative name servers

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,239
are required to keep

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,760
multiple copies of their zone files on

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,920
different

93
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,359
authoritative servers here you see they

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,399
kept four copies of four different

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,400
assortative name servers when you

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
now get a response the response from the

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
higher level

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:51,119
you may ask any of the following name

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,399
servers to for a resource at ucla.edu

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,080
and this is a referral response

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
so when you access it the first one

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
doesn't respond after a time that you

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
ask the next one

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,079
after another time of the one after

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,920
until you get the response similarly at

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,959
the higher levels of the height of

107
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,359
it the issue is that now

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,599
the recursive resolver has to find out

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,760
the ip address of those

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,798
name servers which are given by their

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
domain names

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,320
let's take a closer look here is the

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
referral response

114
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
and here the name server we ask is dot

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,919
edu and the response is a.net

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,080
therefore no ip address may be provided

117
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,320
by the higher level

118
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,599
calling them glue records no legal

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,000
records are allowed

120
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
and the recursive resolver must

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,720
translate and figure out the

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,440
ip addresses by itself it issues

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,800
immediately

124
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,960
at once request resolutions for all the

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
name server names in the referral

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
response

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,479
in order for high availability to have

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,599
all the name servers available as soon

129
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,400
as possible

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,120
and to be able to test the response time

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,359
figure out which one is the fastest

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
and you get as a response more referral

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,280
responses and more packet system with

134
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,039
the ip addresses because

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,758
net is within it when they all

136
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
tried to reach www.microsoft.com on an

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,880
empty cache

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
for if on the recursive resolver he

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,280
installed he's

140
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,520
noticed 54 requests or 126 packets

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,599
comparing with the three packets that we

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,680
saw in the beginning of the talk

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
and this provides us the basics for our

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,960
attack and here is the main building

145
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,479
block of the attack

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,400
we will attack dot net top level domain

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,560
assorted name server and the attacker

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,198
must have two

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
parts is a boat a client to issue a

150
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
request

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,840
and an attacker.com associative name

152
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
server

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
the attacker now issues a request

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,000
bypassing the

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,400
cash by a random string and it gets

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
to the attacking.com which now issues a

157
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,799
referral response

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
and it packs the maximum number of

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
possible

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,000
name server names with dot net and

161
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,680
suffix that target to be resolved

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,840
by the recursive disorder all at once

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,520
the recursive resolver actually issues

164
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,239
270 because it has to also both the ip

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
version 4

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
and the active version 6 of each the

167
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,600
name server

168
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,000
and each request has a response so

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
it has to generate packets so it costs

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,520
them twice as much

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
and their responses are too big to fit

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,799
into the udp packet

173
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,440
and therefore taking a tcp

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,639
which introduces another factor six in

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
the number of packets

176
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,000
on the attack on the victim dividing by

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,720
two packets of the attacker and you get

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,039
an amplification factor of 1620

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,639
with a huge botnet like in the mirai

180
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,719
attack which used a million

181
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,840
bots we get an extremely powerful attack

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
on the top level domain target and

183
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,520
also the recursive resolver is one with

184
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
a lot of packets

185
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,039
of course you can divide the work by

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,080
multiple recursive resolvers

187
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,560
near the attack the victimized.com

188
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,318
other versions you may attack any second

189
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
level domain of your choice

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,039
this time we are trying to attack the

191
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,160
name several two sealable eu

192
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,599
here the attacker will issue

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,880
a referral response with 37 fake name

194
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
all at ucla

195
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,280
tdu and the authorities

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,479
will resolve all of them at once

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,520
actually twice as much 74 of them

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,159
and the resulting amplification factor

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,840
is now

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,639
74 no tcp again with an

201
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,039
extremely large botnet and you got an

202
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
extremely powerful attack on any second

203
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,719
level domain

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
of your choice because the resolver

205
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
again

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
is swamped you may divide the multiple

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,119
recasted resolver

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,520
or concentrate the attack on one

209
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,479
recursive resolver with multiple

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,400
consortive servers and here the last

211
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,199
variation of our attack

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,840
we doubled amplification factor by the

213
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,400
attacker first attacking

214
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,520
itself and then it has now

215
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,520
the credit to issue 74

216
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,878
referral responses each with 135

217
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,840
fake top-level domains the target now

218
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,240
is the root servers they will have to

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,279
resolve those top level domains

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,320
20 000 resolution just for this

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,479
one request and the amplification factor

222
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,959
is 3200 and the dot wood is one

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,480
with a huge amount of packets of course

224
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,839
if you use a large botnet

225
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,160
much larger to acquire

226
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
an assorted natural it's very easy it

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,199
cost you one dollar

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
and very few minutes to associate it

229
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
with any

230
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,920
name server on the internet we tested

231
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
the attack on several dns providers and

232
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,599
those of the different amplification

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,880
factors we noticed

234
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,360
mitigation we suggest to mitigate it by

235
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,880
not resolving all the name several names

236
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
at once but only

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,800
k or one of them at each for each

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
request

239
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,959
also don't allow so many names of an

240
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,920
engineer referral response we see that

241
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,399
99

242
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,079
of referral response have less than

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,680
seven name server names

244
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,560
in them if you see a lot of non-existing

245
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,839
name server

246
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,680
responses at the regressive dissolver

247
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,839
you know there is such an attack because

248
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,439
such responses are possible either if

249
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
there is a misconfiguration

250
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
or in the attack you can also use dna

251
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,760
sec

252
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,399
to minimize the number of non-existing

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,519
requests from the recursive resolvers

254
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,959
and you may enforce going downward only

255
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,320
in the dns system

256
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,719
to further restrict the attack

257
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
max fetch k for example when we use it

258
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,399
for each request we resolve

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,640
one name for the four names of ucla

260
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,680
one more request one more name result

261
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
and so forth

262
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
until all four are resolved the first

263
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
one there is nothing to resolve

264
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
and now you can test which one is the

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,440
fastest max hk

266
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
took down the amplification factor

267
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,480
considerably

268
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,399
we didn't see any effect on the latency

269
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,320
they are the same for with and without

270
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,399
the max one fringe

271
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,160
we've issued the responsible disclosure

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
procedure the foreign companies have

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,040
joined the procedure

274
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,320
90 days back until may 19th one company

275
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,120
club promised us a bug bounty

276
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,600
several cves have been issued and a

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,839
security adviser and critical touch

278
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,760
update in conclusion

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
if you remember the mega eye attack in

280
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,920
2016 took out

281
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,680
several resources on the internet for

282
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,719
many residents in the u.s

283
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,000
this attack is almost one thousand times

284
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,640
more powerful this is very worrisome

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,120
could there be such a fatal error in the

286
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,160
internet is there another such

287
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,320
problem should we use formal automatic

288
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,680
verification method to verify

289
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,519
the dns and bgp and other protocols

290
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,439
which are critical for internet

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,920
operation

292
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
we saw tailors between availability and

293
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
response time

294
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
and they introduced vulnerability which

295
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,079
those were the sources

296
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
of the vulnerability and one may

297
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,599
consider

298
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
redesigning the dna system for more

299
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,920
robust

300
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,880
and highly available system without such

301
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,079
flaws thank you very much for your

302
