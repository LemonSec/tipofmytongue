1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,880
hello everyone my name is castro

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,719
adelaide najad and i'm a phd student at

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,520
epflz's springdale

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,439
today i am presenting datashare network

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,080
this work is a collaboration between

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,119
epfl and international consortium of

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,159
investigative journalists or icij

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,160
so let me briefly introduce icij

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,480
icit is a global network of

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,920
investigative journalists which includes

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,199
more than 250 journalists from over 100

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,440
countries

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
their most well-known work is the panama

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,079
paper which exposed rogue offshore

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
finance

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,200
industry and allowed governments to

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,280
retrieve billions of taxpayers money

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,199
so let's use this project as a case

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,079
study to see how iclu

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,879
operates the panama paper started when

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
an anonymous visa blower leaked over 11

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,960
million documents

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,680
to the organization then hundreds of

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
icid journalists from over 80 countries

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,600
worked on these documents and published

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,960
stories about them these published

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,479
stories resulted in resignation of

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,199
government officials

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,759
like prime ministers and senators and

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
public apology from famous characters

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,840
like

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,680
royal family members celebrities and

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,759
footballers these 11 million documents

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
were already digitalized but they had

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720
many different forms

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,640
like scanned documents pictures emails

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,360
pdfs and word documents handling a large

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
number of

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,040
documents requires having good tools

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
that

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,840
allows these journalists to extract

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,640
information effectively

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,880
that's why icij has developed a document

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,159
management and search platform

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,920
called datashare datashare is an open

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,719
source software which is freely

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,759
available

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,759
at icij's website

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
this software allows journalists to

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,318
process documents and extract

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,598
named entities such as people

52
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,560
organizations

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,599
and locations most of the time

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
journalists are

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,480
spending their time on tracking and

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,200
linking these named entities together

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,599
icij is already using datashare as a

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,319
central service that allows

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,119
their journalists to search corporate

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,440
visually to icij

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
beside that journalist can download the

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
software

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,280
and run it on their local computer

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,440
to search their personal collection

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,760
after a while i see i did notice that

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,840
there are many documents which are

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,160
used only once for a single local

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,480
investigation

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
however in our interconnected sport we

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
can see that how

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,519
other journalists from other countries

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
can benefit from

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,080
having access to these documents

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
that's why icij came to us with the

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,040
problem that

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
can an international group of

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,000
journalists search each other's

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,080
documents while keeping their privacy

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
before jumping ahead and designing the

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
system icj performed

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,519
a survey from their journalists

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
and asked them are you willing to share

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
your documents

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,000
60 percent of surveys responded

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
positively while the remaining 40

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
percent said that

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,720
only if they can have a screening talk

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
with the courier

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
based on this we design our system in

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
two stages

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,760
in the first one a journalist comes to

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,518
our system and wants to search

93
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,879
about an interesting topic of

94
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
investigation

95
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,319
then the system performs a privacy

96
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,280
preserving search and

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,760
find a colleague who has relevant

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,640
document about this investigation

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,879
in the second search we put this to

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,958
journalists in touch and they can have a

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,518
screening talk over an anonymous chapter

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,560
it's important to say to note that there

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,239
is no document retrieval in our system

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,478
and all documentaries happens out of

105
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,959
that

106
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,520
besides asking for willingness to share

107
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,080
we ask journalists to identify and

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,799
assess

109
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
threats in the system based on

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
journalists response

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,639
we identified three types of parties

112
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,440
journalists icj as the organization who

113
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
runs this

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,440
software and third-party adversaries

115
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,280
like

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,400
hackers corporates and governments

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,000
journalists trust their peers

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
to some degree they trust the

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,360
organization

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,919
and they are mainly worried about

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
third-party adversaries

122
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,639
however after having a discussion with

123
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
the icij we decided to overrule

124
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,960
journalists and consider

125
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,479
every party as malicious that's due to

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,359
the fact that journalists

127
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
are worried about strong adversaries who

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
can

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,000
coerce or compromise journalists or the

130
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
icij

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,039
through hacking their computers violence

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,680
or legal processes like subpoenas

133
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
it's important to note that we decided

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,919
to consider journalists and

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,720
the organization as analysis not because

136
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
we do not

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,360
trust them but to protect them and

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
ensure that they do not become valuable

139
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
targets

140
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,440
for hackers now let's expand our setting

141
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,880
a bit more

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,360
icij has around 250 journalists but

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
we are considering up to thousands of

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,320
users

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,198
that's due to the fact that there may be

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,280
future expansions and collaborations

147
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
these journalists are scattered around

148
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,559
the world and they have gathered

149
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
thousands of documents

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
which they are willing to share in our

151
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,440
system

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
now let's take a look at our privacy

153
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
goals

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
first a courier was to protect the

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,318
content of query

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,400
and hide her identity on the other hand

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
a document owner wants to protect the

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,000
corpus and

159
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
ensure that the courier learns the

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,039
minimal information

161
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,198
about the documents and finally

162
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,039
when two journalists have a screening

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,880
talk together they want to keep the

164
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,759
content and existence of this

165
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
conversation

166
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
hidden despite the fact that a

167
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
conversation

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,960
hints to the existence of a

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,319
collaboration which is a sensitive

170
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,560
information for journalists

171
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
till now i told you what we need for

172
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,400
this system

173
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,479
now let's design it the first challenge

174
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,799
that we face is asynchrony

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,680
journalists live in different time zones

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
and they do not

177
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,680
keep their computer online all the time

178
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,799
that's why two journalists may never be

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
online

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,840
at the same time

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
to handle this challenge we use a

182
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
communication server which

183
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,840
stores and forwards encrypted messages

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,240
between journals

185
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,239
we consider that this communication

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,080
server is malicious

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,000
and it only serves a service in

188
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
sending a message to an offline

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
journalist

190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,239
all communication in our system goes

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
through this server

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,720
the second challenge that we face is

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,919
finding a document owner who has

194
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,039
relevant documents to solve this

195
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,120
challenge we design a document search

196
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
as a reminder this search needs to

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,599
protect the content of the query

198
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,360
the corpus and the result of the search

199
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
to do this we designed a new

200
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,039
cryptographic primitive which we called

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,919
multiset private set intersection

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,800
this primitive is an extension of an

203
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,198
existing

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,680
protocol called private set intersection

205
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,639
or psi

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,120
so what is psi as the name suggests is a

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
two party protocol between alice and bob

208
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,479
which allows alice

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,440
to compute the intersection of her set

210
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,080
with pause

211
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,719
the psi protocol ensures that bob does

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,680
not learn any information about alice's

213
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,680
input

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,360
while ali should not learn anything

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,319
about bob's sets beyond the intersection

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
as i mentioned before the data share

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,960
software

218
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
extract named entities from these

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,399
documents and represent them

220
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,839
as a set of documents therefore

221
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,679
the psi protocol can search one document

222
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,880
which is represented as a set of

223
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,519
keywords

224
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,040
however each journalist holds thousands

225
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
of documents and

226
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
having thousands of psi interactions

227
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,279
cause prohibited

228
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,600
that's why we decided to expand this

229
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,880
scenario and allow bob to hold

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,680
and set simultaneously while alice

231
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,040
compute all

232
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,359
and intersections at the same time

233
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,439
with aggregating the cost between

234
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
multiple sets

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
we reduce the computation and

236
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,880
communication costs

237
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,760
by three orders of magnitude

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,399
and ms psi protocol can search the whole

239
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,640
compass

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,720
with one in drive

241
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,839
now let's integrate this search into our

242
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
system

243
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,240
a query here creates a query send it to

244
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,959
the communication server

245
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
whenever a journalist comes online he

246
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
retrieves a query

247
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,959
computes the response and send it back

248
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,760
to the communication server

249
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,040
after a while the courier retrieves all

250
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
these responses

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,959
processes them and finds journalists who

252
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
have relevant documents

253
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,119
the next challenge that we face is

254
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,359
enabling a screening talk

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,279
to do this we design an anonymous

256
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
messaging system

257
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,720
i'm going to skip details and just

258
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,359
mention that

259
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,519
we use a dv helmet key exchange to find

260
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,880
a random rendezvous point

261
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,920
and use pause on cover messages to allow

262
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,399
us to achieve

263
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,719
an observability if you are interested

264
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,880
to know more about this messaging system

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,959
feel free to read our paper

266
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,279
afterwards we combined anonymous

267
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,959
messaging and document search and other

268
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,480
privacy enhancing tools that we

269
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,800
mentioned in the paper

270
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
to design the data share network and now

271
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,399
we need to access its privacy

272
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,040
we do this in four layers first for

273
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,360
mspsi primitive we show that it achieves

274
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,279
the same privacy as the state of the art

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,040
psi particles

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
and use it to show that the document

277
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,040
search only reveals

278
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,040
information about the search keyword

279
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,519
besides that we show that our messaging

280
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,439
system

281
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,000
achieves an observability finally we do

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,839
an end-to-end privacy analysis of data

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,480
share network and show that we achieve

284
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,399
our privacy goals

285
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,600
it's important to note that we are

286
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
considering a new

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
stronger setting in which we want to

288
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
protect a

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,680
corpus from an adversary who has search

290
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,839
access to it be sure that it's possible

291
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,640
to provide some degree of protection

292
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,320
even against such a strong adversary

293
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
however there are some fundamental

294
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,160
limits to document search

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,160
which we address in our pick

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,880
in conclusion we performed a requirement

297
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,160
analysis

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,200
on investigative journalists we designed

299
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,439
a new

300
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,519
cryptographic primitive which we called

301
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,079
multi-set private set intersection

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,959
and used it to design a privacy

303
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,880
preserving document search

304
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,319
we designed an anonymous messaging

305
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
system to enable us

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
to have anonymous screening talks and

307
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,519
we've performed an

308
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,880
end-to-end system design and privacy

309
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,000
analysis

310
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,680
even more we have

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
formal proofs in our extended paper

312
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,199
thank you for your attention and if

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,839
there is any question

314
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,839
