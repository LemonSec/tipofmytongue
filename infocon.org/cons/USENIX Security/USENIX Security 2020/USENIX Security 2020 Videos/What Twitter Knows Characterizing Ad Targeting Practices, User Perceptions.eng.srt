00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,960
hi

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,799
i'm miranda way graduate student at the

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,960
university of washington

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,279
today i'm presenting work done with my

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
co-authors at the university of chicago

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,560
university of maryland and university of

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,560
southampton

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,880
the title of our work is what twitter

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,680
knows characterizing ad targeting

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
practices

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,198
user perceptions and ad explanations

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,200
through users own twitter data

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,600
many online companies offer targeted

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
advertising which allows advertisers to

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
use detailed information about users

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
demographics

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
preferences and more to target ads what

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
comes to mind first

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
might be targeting by gender location or

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,718
general interests

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
but social media companies collect much

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
more detailed information

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
like how you interact with platform

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,800
posts or other users

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,559
so in reality ad targeting criteria are

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,559
creepily specific

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,718
this is an ad that was shown to me on

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
twitter in september of 2018

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,880
from heinz ketchup about their heinz

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
fantasy sandwich campaign

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
this ad was targeted to me because i

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,520
matched 16 criteria set by heinz

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
including being on their list

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,679
of organic and natural ketchup buyers as

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
well as apparently interacting with

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,159
hashtag parenting on twitter

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,439
i was able to learn this information

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,920
because of gdpr

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,158
and similar data regulations through the

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
data access requests as required by

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,960
these laws

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,799
twitter offers detailed targeting

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,919
information for the ads

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,000
that their users see we use this data to

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,439
conduct a study that measured targeted

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
advertising on twitter

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
as well as user perceptions and

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
preferences of that targeting

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,639
we asked two main research questions

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,919
first

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
what are the discrete targeting

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
mechanisms offered to advertisers on

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
twitter

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
and how are they used to target twitter

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,199
users in other words

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,279
we used participants twitter data to

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
measure how advertisers are targeting

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,880
ads on twitter

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,479
second what do twitter users think of

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
these practices and the existing

61
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,560
transparency mechanisms

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,720
to that end we conducted a user study

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,520
based on each participant's own twitter

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
data

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
for part a we investigate perceptions of

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,000
comfort and fairness

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
for part b we study ad explanations

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
which are meant to help

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
users understand how an ad was chosen

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
for them for our study

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
we first recruited participants from the

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,640
prolific crowdsourcing platform to

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,399
request their twitter data

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,760
we then invited them back a few days

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,879
later when they had received their

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
twitter data

77
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,120
we automatically extracted and uploaded

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
only three twitter files that were

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
related to advertising

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,200
we parsed the data to create customized

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,160
surveys about targeting types found in

82
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,839
their files

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
as well as their opinions of ad

84
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
explanations

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
so now i'll start with the first

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
research question what ad targeting

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
mechanisms

88
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,160
exist on twitter and how are they used

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,120
to target users

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,959
we received valid data from 231

91
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
participants for this study

92
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
the average person had spent 6.6 years

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,239
on twitter

94
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
and saw over a thousand ads in the last

95
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,319
three months

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,159
across all our participants we collected

97
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,079
over 240 000

98
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,560
ads that used at least one targeting

99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
type an example of a targeting type is

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,920
targeting by location

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,440
we also observed over 45 000 different

102
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,920
instances of targeting

103
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,480
indicating a huge diversity of instances

104
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,958
used by advertisers to target ads

105
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,440
for example boston is just one instance

106
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,519
of location targeting

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,879
through our analysis of users twitter

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,959
advertising data

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,280
we found 30 specific targeting

110
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,560
mechanisms that we categorize into three

111
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,480
groups

112
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,319
the first is demographic targeting

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,040
characteristics about users and their

114
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,200
devices

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
either provided by the user or inferred

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,958
by twitter

117
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,238
ads can be targeted on zero or more

118
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,680
targeting types

119
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,879
we saw language targeting used over 350

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,519
000 times across 240 000 ads

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,079
which means on average ads used more

122
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
than one

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
instance of language targeting platform

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,680
and location were also frequently used

125
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
but others were less well known like

126
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
targeting based on whether you're using

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
a new device

128
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,279
which is something that's inferred by

129
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,680
twitter

130
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,478
the second is psychographic users

131
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
lifestyles

132
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,120
behaviors or attitudes as provided by

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
users are inferred by twitter

134
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
the more well studied in the academic

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,599
literature are behavior and interest

136
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
targeting

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,040
which were used tens of thousands of

138
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,198
times in our data

139
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
but we found others that were used more

140
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,600
than these commonly studied types

141
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,840
for example follower lookalikes allows

142
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
advertisers to target people who are

143
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,638
similar to followers of an account

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,720
even if they don't follow that account

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
conversation targeting targets users

146
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
based on conversations they've engaged

147
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,360
with on twitter

148
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
finally the third is advertiser provided

149
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
which uses

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,400
information that advertisers collected

151
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,479
about users off of twitter

152
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
these targeting types can be very opaque

153
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,758
to users

154
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
for example tailored lists which use

155
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
lists of users

156
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
as determined and uploaded by the

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,400
advertiser mobile targeting

158
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,039
allows advertisers let's advertisers to

159
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
target users of their own mobile apps

160
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
and tailored web lets advertisers target

161
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,199
people that have previously visited

162
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,120
their website

163
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
twitter has advertising policies that

164
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
prohibit targeting

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
by sensitive or legal categories yet

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
in going through our data we came across

167
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,840
a few potential violations

168
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,880
we observed targeting to keywords like

169
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,880
unemployment

170
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,880
gay african american and latinas

171
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,719
we also observed targeting to those that

172
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,759
had engaged in conversations about

173
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
liberal demo

174
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,600
liberal democrats a uk political party

175
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
some names of tailored list targeting

176
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,080
also suggested violations

177
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,080
such as account status balance due

178
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,039
christian audience to exclude

179
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
and lgbt suppression list these names

180
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,240
are selected by advertisers for their

181
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,239
own reference

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
advertisers can upload lists of user

183
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,360
identifiers like twitter handles

184
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,600
to specify the users they want to target

185
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
although these potential violations were

186
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
overall in the minority

187
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,479
these are just some examples of

188
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,520
targeting that could be perceived as

189
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,599
sensitive

190
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,120
i'll return to the implications of

191
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,240
finding potential violations

192
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,080
at the end of this talk now

193
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
i'll talk about part a of the second

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
research question

195
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
what were our participants thoughts

196
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,280
about ad targeting

197
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,360
our user study elicited participants

198
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,000
opinions about ad targeting

199
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,600
crucially these survey questions asked

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,280
about ways the user had

201
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,039
actually been targeted according to

202
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,799
their twitter data

203
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,639
we asked about the use of targeting

204
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
types generally such as

205
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
targeting based on events as well as the

206
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
use of specific

207
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,840
instances such as the 2019 women's world

208
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,000
cup

209
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,000
participants tended to be okay with the

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,599
general but less so with specific

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
instances

212
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
only 25 percent of participants did not

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,639
want to see ads that used event

214
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
targeting

215
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
however when participants saw a specific

216
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,360
event they were targeted on

217
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
65 percent did not want to be targeted

218
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,800
when participants agreed that an

219
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,880
instance of targeting was accurate

220
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
they were significantly more likely to

221
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,159
agree it was fair and be comfortable

222
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,719
with it

223
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,560
overall accuracy was highly correlated

224
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
with many other perceptions

225
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,280
but this doesn't justify collecting more

226
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
data to increase accuracy at the cost of

227
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,479
privacy

228
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
our free text responses indicated an

229
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,599
upper bound

230
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
where increasing accuracy is no longer

231
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,240
comfortable

232
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,960
now i'll talk about part 2b regarding

233
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,759
transparency of how a particular ad was

234
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,758
chosen for a particular user

235
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
specifically we compared six ad

236
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
explanations

237
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
for each we selected a twitter ad that

238
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
the participant

239
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,479
actually saw and the explanation used

240
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,719
their twitter data to show how that ad

241
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,318
had been targeted to them

242
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
the first two were current ad

243
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
explanations twitter's is pretty simple

244
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,960
and shows at most

245
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,120
three targeting criteria of any ad even

246
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,520
if there were more than three

247
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
facebook's includes a timeline to show

248
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,719
when advertisers

249
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
may have uploaded information used to

250
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,039
target this ad

251
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
we then tested some speculative ad

252
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,318
explanations

253
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,479
which we created to let users have a

254
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
much more comprehensive look at how ads

255
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,639
were targeted to them

256
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
we created detailed text and detailed

257
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
visual which showed

258
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,640
instances that were used and explored

259
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,958
different visual layouts

260
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
we also created an explanation to probe

261
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,319
the upper bound of

262
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
information to include which we dubbed

263
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
the creepy ad explanation

264
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
given prior work we expected an ad

265
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,479
explanation that explained all of the

266
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
nitty gritty details to be perceived as

267
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
creepy

268
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
and finally we compared all of these to

269
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,000
a control that provided no meaningful

270
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
information about how the ad was

271
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
targeted

272
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
participants were shown these

273
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,440
explanations in random order

274
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,119
and weren't told where they were from

275
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
comparing the ad explanations

276
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,640
we found that participants valued having

277
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
more information

278
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,880
about how ads were targeted these bar

279
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
charts show

280
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,720
the percentage of participants that

281
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,240
strongly agreed and agreed that an

282
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
explanation was useful

283
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
and whether they would want to see

284
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,880
similar explanations in the future

285
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,640
control was the least useful followed by

286
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,279
facebook and twitter

287
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,160
participants rated our three speculative

288
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,399
ad explanations the most useful

289
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,719
in our qualitative responses we found

290
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
that participants perceived ambiguity to

291
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
mean information was missing or

292
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
intentionally omitted

293
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,720
which may explain why they preferred our

294
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,000
more detailed explanations

295
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
in conclusion i have four key takeaways

296
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
first advertising transparency is

297
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
extremely important

298
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,560
gdpr's right to data access was the only

299
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
way we were able to do this study

300
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
and there's still more transparency to

301
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,640
be had given that it took us

302
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,640
months to obtain clarifications needed

303
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,959
to understand the ad data which was

304
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,560
presented as a json dump

305
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,560
part of our study relied on

306
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,880
understanding a data field named

307
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,040
matched targeting criteria and whether

308
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
this meant all criteria had actually

309
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,560
been matched to the user

310
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,240
after four months they clarified that

311
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,399
yes it does

312
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,279
we sent our request twice first to

313
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,760
twitter support

314
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,680
and then to the data protection officer

315
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,959
the first time we just received links to

316
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,719
help pages

317
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,319
and the second time the data protection

318
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,519
officer said they would be using a

319
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,240
60-day extension

320
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,720
as allowed by gdpr although the actual

321
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
answer came after that period

322
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
this information should have been

323
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,800
provided from the beginning

324
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,880
upon data access so transparency is key

325
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
also through this work we uncovered that

326
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
well-studied targeting types like

327
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,199
interest targeting

328
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
were some of the least important to our

329
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,959
participants instead

330
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
lesser known types like tailored

331
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,518
audiences and look-alike targeting

332
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,480
were perceived as more concerning and

333
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,040
thus warrant further study

334
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
as i mentioned earlier advertisers

335
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,240
uploaded

336
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
and named lists of user identifiers for

337
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
targeting

338
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,199
which is how we uncovered some potential

339
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
twitter policy violations

340
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,399
but without advertisers naming their

341
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,079
list descriptively

342
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,079
we would never have known that there was

343
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,399
a list of christians that the advertiser

344
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,239
wanted to exclude from their campaign

345
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
this raises more long-term questions

346
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
about enforcing and maintaining

347
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
transparency

348
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,120
given that advertisers can change list

349
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,279
names or use other ways to hide how

350
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
they're targeting users

351
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
and finally we've found that existing ad

352
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,160
explanations should be much more

353
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
detailed

354
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,240
as i mentioned before we expected a

355
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,920
highly detailed ad explanation to be

356
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,160
perceived as creepy

357
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,000
but instead we found this explanation

358
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
was the most desirable

359
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
participants wanted to know the full

360
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,639
story about how they were targeted

361
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,000
existing explanations are at the low end

362
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
of the detail spectrum

363
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,160
and could be much more helpful if they

364
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:11,839
included more information

365
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,839
thank you so much for listening

366
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,040
you
