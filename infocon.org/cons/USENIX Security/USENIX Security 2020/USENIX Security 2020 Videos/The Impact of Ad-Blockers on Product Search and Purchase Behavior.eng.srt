hello everyone my name is alyssa frick

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,040
i'm a research associate at uc berkeley

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
and ixe and today i will present the

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
results of a lab experiment on the

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
effects of our blockers on product

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,759
search and purchase behaviors

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,119
that we conducted together with the

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,840
colleagues from carnegie mellon

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
university

alessandra christie and emily haviland

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,199
online advertising has become a rapidly

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,160
growing and important market for global

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,640
economy

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,800
internet advertising revenues in 2018

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,520
have accounted to almost a third of

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
total worldwide advertising spending

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,960
a large proportion of growing

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,078
advertising revenues come from fine

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,239
grain targeting

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,760
based on users personal information and

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,440
online behaviors

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,680
in response to this massive data

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,599
collection and advertising exposure

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,920
more than a quarter of internet users

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,760
deploy technological solutions that help

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,879
to remove advertising content from

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,039
visited websites

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,718
and prevent tracking of their online

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
activities

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,119
on the one hand ad blockers mitigate

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,640
security risks by reducing exposure to

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,240
malicious advertising

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,479
provide more delightful internet

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
experience without clutter protecting

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
users from information overload and

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
guarding the independence of their

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
decision making

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,960
reduce searching costs making internet

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
search more time efficient

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,439
and finally protect them from potential

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,799
price and offer discrimination caused by

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
the ads

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
on the other hand advertisers claim that

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
by blocking ads

45
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
users lose the benefits attributed to

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
advertising

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,039
such as access to the personalized

48
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,880
offers and discounts

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
and advantages of matching bars to

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
sellers

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,520
moreover it hurts advertises and

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
publishers profits

53
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
and undermines the most common digital

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
business model which relies on

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
advertising revenue

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
jeopardizing the idea of free content on

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
the internet

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,119
prior research on ad blockers has been

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,798
mostly focused on their effectiveness

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,320
and usability so far

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
in terms of how good they are in

62
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
removing advertising content from web

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
pages

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
and how they affect web page loading

65
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,160
speed usage of devices memory

66
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
battery and other resources another line

67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,799
of research has been focused on the

68
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
effectiveness of

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
advertising itself its impact on

70
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
conversion rates and sales business

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,879
revenues competition market structure

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
and concentration

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,920
this research often took a business

74
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,760
center approach

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,839
whereas the effectiveness of online

76
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
advertising and targeting was analyzed

77
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,280
from the perspective of one company

78
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,200
sending ad messages to many consumers

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
we decided to fill the gap in empirical

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
research and take the user-centered

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,720
perspective

82
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,040
whereas each users each user receives ad

83
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,640
messages from various companies

84
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
the main research question we are trying

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,399
to shed light on is what are the effects

86
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,000
of deploying of ad blocking technologies

87
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,160
on consumer product search

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
and purchase behaviors and the resulting

89
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,519
outcomes

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
to this end we ran a between subject lab

91
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
experiment with two conditions

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
in why not blockers were enabled and in

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,640
another they were not

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,400
we asked participants to search online

95
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
for some products for purchase

96
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,920
and then compared online searching and

97
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
purchasing behaviors of users

98
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,760
exposed to online ads and users for whom

99
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,440
online ads were blocked

100
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,359
next i will explain the experimental

101
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,359
methodology in more detail

102
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
we compared the treatment effects on

103
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
users economic welfare

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,560
in terms of their expenditures and

105
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
prices of chosen products

106
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,159
time to spend on searching the products

107
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
and consumer satisfaction

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,040
in short and long term by short term we

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
mean consumer satisfaction measured

110
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
immediately after ordering a product

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
by long term we mean consumer

112
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,519
satisfaction measured after the purchase

113
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,760
product

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
has been already delivered we'll look at

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
the aspects of satisfaction related to

116
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,879
browsing experience

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,080
overall product choice price unexpected

118
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,840
and actual perceived quality

119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
first using survey we screened out

120
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
participants younger than 18 years old

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,159
and those who haven't made any online

122
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
purchase in the last whole month

123
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
two weeks later we invited the glitch

124
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,519
for participants to the lab

125
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,439
each participant was randomly assigned

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
to one of the experimental conditions

127
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,640
in the control condition the ad blocking

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
extensions were not enabled

129
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,480
and participants were exposed to all ads

130
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,920
in the blog condition

131
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
laptops were instrumented with the

132
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,320
popularity blocking extensions such as

133
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
adblock plus ghost 3 and ublock origin

134
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
configured to block ads at the maximum

135
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
state of their defectiveness rate

136
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
we also had the icons of those

137
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
extensions participants signed a consent

138
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,520
form and read the instructions

139
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
and then we asked them to search and

140
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,719
choose the preferred products from a

141
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
particular product category

142
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
there were 10 categories in total

143
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,759
presented in randomized ordered and

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
products included things like books and

145
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
candles

146
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
they had 40 minutes but didn't have to

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
choose all 10

148
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,320
products to minimize the time pressure

149
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
to prevent contamination of search

150
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
results

151
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
subjects searched each product in an

152
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
independent browser profile

153
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
and all the browsing history cache

154
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
cookies and temporary files were

155
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
automatically deleted after each credit

156
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,320
category search

157
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
for participation subject received 15 in

158
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
cash an additional 25 dollar budget for

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
purchasing a product

160
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,599
regardless of how much they actually

161
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,199
spent on that credit

162
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
at the end of the experiment one of the

163
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,880
chosen products was selected at random

164
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
and participants had to purchase it

165
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
using their own credit card and personal

166
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
details

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,120
finally they completed an exit

168
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
questionnaire about the experiment

169
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
satisfaction and

170
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
some demographics once the participants

171
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,719
sent us the word confirmation email we

172
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
paid them the promise 25

173
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
and recorded the date of expected

174
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
delivery and two weeks after the

175
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
delivery we sent a full web survey about

176
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
satisfaction with the delivery products

177
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,280
and that was it because the online

178
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
environment is dynamic and constantly

179
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
changing

180
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
we serve not the live web pages but

181
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,758
static pages

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,080
that we previously saved for the given

183
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,759
search query it allowed us to preserve

184
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,199
the order of links and ensure that

185
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
across all experimental sessions

186
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,039
participants saw the same links

187
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,198
in the same order once they click on a

188
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,318
link they would land on real web

189
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,639
page of the correspondent website

190
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,319
in terms of types of ads you can see on

191
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,600
the slide the chrome boxes indicator

192
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
kind of search results

193
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
red boxes indicate sponsored top links

194
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
and there were similar ads at the bottom

195
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
of the page as well

196
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,039
and blue box indicate the google

197
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
shopping sponsored listing

198
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
as you could see on the right in the

199
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
blog condition participants were not

200
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,240
exposed to search ads at all

201
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,600
display ads on the websites were also

202
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,680
blocked for them by the ad blockers

203
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
we recruited 212 participants using

204
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,440
carnegie mellon university participant

205
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
pool craigslist and flyers encompassing

206
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
around the city

207
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,520
the sample was diverse in age and

208
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,919
balanced in terms of gender

209
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,960
in a nutshell we found no significant

210
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,039
treatment effects

211
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,198
however those no results still provided

212
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,318
us valuable insights about ad blockers

213
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,080
preserving the consumer welfare

214
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
regarding the perceived role of online

215
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
advertising the majority of participants

216
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,880
i created it as distracting and

217
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,120
intrusive

218
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
and found it disturbing on the other

219
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,560
hand many participants agree that it

220
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,919
does create brand awareness

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
although only thirty seven percent

222
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
believe it eventually pierce tweets to

223
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,159
buy

224
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,919
products more than half of the

225
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
participants are created advertising is

226
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,639
informative

227
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
about available products their prices or

228
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,880
discounts and is necessary to enjoy free

229
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
services on the internet

230
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
but less than half a grade and online

231
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,360
ads help to find products and services

232
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,759
that

233
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
match one's personality and interests

234
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,599
raising doubts about the perceived

235
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,440
benefits of targeted ads

236
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,440
only about a third of participants that

237
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,360
created online ads save money

238
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,680
time and help to buy the best products

239
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
for a given price

240
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
for the sake of time today i will focus

241
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,198
on the main treatment effects and for

242
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,400
the more details about the findings

243
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,080
i invite you to read the actual paper

244
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
we found new statistically significant

245
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,840
treatment effects of ad blocking and

246
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
prices of the chosen products

247
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
in other words participants in the blog

248
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,198
condition didn't choose less or more

249
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,479
expensive products than in the no block

250
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
condition

251
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,758
however participants with prior ad block

252
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,680
experience

253
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,319
those who use adblockers in their own

254
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
computers tended to choose about 10

255
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,759
cheaper products than non-users

256
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,719
regardless of which experimental

257
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,520
condition we assign them to

258
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,680
next dependent variable is search time

259
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
the absence of ads didn't substantially

260
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,960
increase or decrease the search costs

261
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,758
for participants

262
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,758
and while experienced ad blocker users

263
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
didn't spend less time or more time in

264
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,960
product searching

265
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,800
they inspected slightly more search

266
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,120
results than non-users so they went a

267
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,959
little bit deeper in their search

268
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,039
participants who chose the products from

269
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,039
sponsored google shopping listings spent

270
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,799
less time in their search than those who

271
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,679
chose the products following organic

272
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,958
links

273
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
possibly because google shopping

274
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,199
listings are located on the top of the

275
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,199
page

276
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
and they contain a preview the product

277
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,160
image price and seller

278
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,080
facilitated the comparison now let's

279
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
look at browsing satisfaction

280
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
it was measured using likert scale scale

281
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,680
along seven

282
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,599
aspects including overall pleasure from

283
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,519
browsing experience speed of webpage

284
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,800
load relevance of the results

285
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,240
uh to the query and so on

286
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
the only aspect that varies

287
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,240
statistically significantly between

288
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
conditions was satisfaction was the web

289
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
page loading speed

290
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,959
which was higher in the no block

291
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,959
condition where ad blockers were

292
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,880
disabled

293
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,880
and while online ads do slow down the

294
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,720
computer it has been shown that ad

295
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,560
adblockers may not be the most efficient

296
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
tool improving the loading speed

297
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,000
to the complexity of advocate script

298
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
execution itself

299
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
our own auxiliary experiment of computer

300
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,760
performance showed that the web page

301
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
speed was indeed slower in the blog

302
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,720
condition

303
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,800
because ad blocking extensions utilize

304
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
additional computational resources

305
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,160
however while participants were not

306
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,160
satisfied with the lower speed of web

307
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,839
page loading and the blog condition

308
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,360
it didn't really affect the total amount

309
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,440
of time they spent on product searching

310
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,519
we also computed an index of overall

311
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
browsing experience satisfaction

312
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,279
while there was no treatment effect on

313
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,959
this index it was a little bit lower

314
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,519
among experienced and locker users

315
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
moving forward to product satisfaction

316
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
there were

317
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
no significant treatment effects on

318
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
product choice price and quality

319
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,880
satisfaction

320
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,719
experienced adblocker users were a

321
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,480
little bit less satisfied

322
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
but only with the product choices

323
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
usually both immediately after the

324
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,040
experiment and after the delivery of the

325
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,279
project

326
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,199
but not with other aspects of

327
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,959
satisfaction

328
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,720
finally we compared the effects of

329
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,518
different types of ads in the no block

330
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,760
condition

331
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
and we found that first product chosen

332
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,000
from sponsored google shopping listings

333
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
had lower prices on a 10 level of

334
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
significance

335
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,959
and they required less time for their

336
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,519
search but it didn't result in lower

337
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,599
price

338
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
but they did result in lower price and

339
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
short term

340
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,000
quality satisfaction second products

341
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
chosen from top sponsored links had

342
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,720
higher prices

343
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,800
however those higher prices didn't

344
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
affect satisfaction

345
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
finally products chosen from bottom

346
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,920
sponsored links didn't have

347
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,839
significantly higher prices

348
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
but they resulted in lower product

349
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,000
choice and short-term quality

350
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,399
satisfaction

351
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,399
in essence our experiment doesn't find

352
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
the evidence that just deployment of ad

353
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
blockers

354
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,440
aiming at protecting users privacy

355
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,319
security and reducing clutter and online

356
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
experiences

357
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
have detrimental effects on consumers

358
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,399
welfare in terms of satisfactionist

359
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,640
products their prices perceived quality

360
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
or time spent on their online searching

361
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,319
therefore red blockers are ultimately

362
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,079
not only privacy and security enhancing

363
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
but also welfare preserving for

364
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,239
consumers ad blockers negatively

365
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
affected the satisfaction with webpage

366
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
loading speed

367
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
however didn't increase searching time

368
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,920
it didn't have negative effects on other

369
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,720
aspects of online browsing

370
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,640
finally longer experience with ad

371
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,279
blockers may be associated with

372
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,120
other effects for instance in our study

373
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,560
experience that locker uses china to

374
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,160
choose cheaper products

375
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
inspect more search results before

376
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,519
making purchasing decisions

377
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,599
and be less satisfied with browsing

378
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,880
experience and product choices

379
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
field experiment we are currently

380
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,560
working on is called to investigate

381
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
those long-term effects of adblockers in

382
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,760
more detail

383
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
that's all for today for more details

384
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,720
please refer to the paper

385
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,160
