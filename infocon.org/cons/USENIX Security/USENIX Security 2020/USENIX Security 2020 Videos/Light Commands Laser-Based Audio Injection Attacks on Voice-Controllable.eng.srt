00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,559
hello

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,239
my name is benjamin seer and i'm a third

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,200
year phd student at the university of

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
michigan

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
today i will be talking about our work

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,240
on light commands where we use lasers to

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
inject audio into voice controllable

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,038
systems

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,560
in recent years we've seen technology

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,840
develop to give more and more power to

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,279
our voices

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,880
instead of interacting with computers

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,080
with traditional mechanisms like mice

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
and keyboard

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,839
we can now speak to devices to use them

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,479
we call these devices voice controllable

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,280
systems

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,959
or vcs's these systems work by recording

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,559
an audio signal with a microphone

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
using speech recognition algorithms to

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,760
passwords out of this audio signal

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
and then performing commands based on

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,920
the words it parses using vcss we can

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
perform many operations

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
from setting timers making online

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
purchases or controlling other smart

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
devices around the home

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
as we have given more power to our

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,039
voices there's a rising concern over the

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
security of these devices

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,280
more power means there is more risk if

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,559
an attacker can compromise a vcs

33
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,239
these concerns come out of several

34
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,080
factors often there's a trade-off

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
between security and usability

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,679
for example you may want to give the

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
user multiple chances to give a passcode

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
to ensure the device is properly

39
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,640
recognizing the speech correctly

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
but sometimes this can allow an attacker

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,720
to brute force the code

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
these devices also often use third party

43
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
software to interact with other devices

44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,520
sometimes bypassing security and

45
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,280
privilege checks

46
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,039
and finally in the one i want to focus

47
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
on is the fact that these devices

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,200
blindly trust the microphones

49
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,240
to make critical decisions for the user

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
and this is a big problem

51
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,079
voice controllable systems are designed

52
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
under an underlying assumption

53
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,919
microphones capture acoustic signals but

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
i'm here to tell you that reality is a

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
little different

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
microphones actually capture acoustic

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
signals and light signals

58
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,759
this little gap between the assumption

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
of the vcs design and the reality of its

60
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,880
implementation

61
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,520
leaves open a potential attack vector

62
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,079
and this leads to two big questions

63
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
one how does this laser injection affect

64
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,960
voice controllable systems

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,479
and two how can we protect vcs's against

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,079
laser injection

67
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,598
in this research work we sought to

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
answer these questions and provided

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,720
several contributions

70
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,879
we discovered and investigated what we

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,480
call light commands commands issued by

72
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
light signal injection into mems

73
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,519
microphones

74
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
we then analyze the limits of this light

75
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
based vulnerability and many common vcs

76
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,720
devices

77
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,480
that use mems microphones we found that

78
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
in some devices we can inject a command

79
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,359
110 meters away

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
with the equivalent power of a laser

81
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,760
pointer and show that this works through

82
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
glass windows and between buildings

83
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,518
we then demonstrate the risks that this

84
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,920
attack can have on smart speakers

85
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
smartphones smart home devices and cars

86
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
with remote access

87
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
and finally we suggest potential

88
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,959
countermeasures to defend against this

89
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
attack

90
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
to look at how we inject light signals

91
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
into microphones we first need to look

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
at mems microphones the microphones most

93
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,720
used in voice controllable systems

94
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,879
most vcs devices have acoustic ports

95
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
visible on the outside of the device

96
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,760
these ports allow acoustic pressure

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,080
waves to pass directly to a mems

98
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,679
microphone where they can be measured in

99
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
many of these microphones a parallel

100
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
plate capacitor is formed out of a

101
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,840
movable diaphragm and a stationary back

102
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,519
plate

103
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
whenever the diaphragm moves in response

104
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
to acoustic pressure the capacitance

105
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,760
changes

106
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
this change is converted to a voltage

107
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
signal by the onboard asic

108
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,440
in our experiments we have found that

109
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
these microphones do not only measure

110
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
acoustic signals

111
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,399
but are sensitive to light signals in

112
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
particular the output voltage of the

113
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
microphone is affected by light

114
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,399
irradiance

115
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
which can be thought of as the optical

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
power density of the light

117
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,079
by firing a focused laser beam into the

118
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
acoustic port we can inject arbitrary

119
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,239
signals into the microphone

120
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
simply by modulating the optical power

121
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
of a laser

122
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,400
or in other words changing the

123
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,080
brightness of the laser beam

124
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
these are the three key ideas of laser

125
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
signal injection one

126
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,599
amplitude modulated light generates a

127
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,439
voltage on the microphone output

128
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,798
two the higher the amplitude of the

129
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
light signal then the higher the

130
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,599
amplitude of the voltage signal

131
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
meaning that we can make a stronger

132
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,679
output signal or in acoustic terms

133
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
a louder output signal by increasing the

134
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
amplitude of the laser modulation

135
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,439
and three the conversion of light signal

136
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
into voltage signal adds very little

137
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,840
distortion within the range of audio

138
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,519
frequencies

139
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,519
allowing arbitrary audio signals to be

140
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
injected these insights are what make

141
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,600
the attack possible

142
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,279
but how is this working well our current

143
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,479
theory is that this light injection is

144
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,679
the combination of two different

145
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,599
physical effects

146
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
first there's a strong potential of

147
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
photoelectric effects on the asic itself

148
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,199
when light enters through the acoustic

149
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
port not all of it is absorbed by the

150
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,520
diaphragm

151
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
a portion of the light actually enters

152
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,198
the package reflects off the backing and

153
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
hits the asic

154
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
when light hits the pn junctions present

155
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
in the asic there will be a generation

156
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
of photocurrent

157
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
which will change the output voltage

158
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,599
second

159
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
there's also the potential of

160
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
photoacoustic effects where light causes

161
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,479
vibrations on the diaphragm due to

162
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,680
thermal effects or other light material

163
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,599
interactions

164
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
in this in this case the vibrations are

165
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
interpreted as acoustic waves affecting

166
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
the output signal

167
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,039
seeing that we could potentially inject

168
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,039
audio using this technique we made a

169
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,560
setup to convert audio from a laptop

170
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,240
into a light signal that we can inject

171
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,400
into a mems microphone

172
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
to do this we take the voltage signal

173
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
from the audio output of the laptop

174
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,599
and feed it into the modulation input of

175
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,119
a laser current driver

176
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
the driver simply converts the voltage

177
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,240
signal into a current signal

178
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,080
which is necessary since the optical

179
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
power of the laser diode is proportional

180
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,680
to the current across it

181
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
the laser current driver also adds a dc

182
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,520
bias to ensure that the laser diode

183
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,599
stays forward biased

184
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,799
the laser is then aimed at the acoustic

185
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
port of the microphone where it

186
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
generates a voltage signal

187
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,479
now that we have a basis for injecting

188
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
arbitrary audio signals into microphones

189
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
we can use this to inject the commands

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
into voice controllable systems

191
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,239
the full attack is shown below first

192
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,758
using a laptop we record audio of

193
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
someone speaking a voice command

194
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,520
for example ok google open the garage

195
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,280
door

196
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
we then play this recording taking the

197
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,599
voltage signal from the output of the

198
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,919
laptop

199
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
amplify it with a simple audio amplifier

200
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,880
and then feed the signal into the

201
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
modulation input of the laser current

202
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
driver

203
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,359
the laser driver converts the voltage

204
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,039
into a current signal and by driving the

205
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
current across the diode we generate an

206
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,039
amplitude modulated light signal

207
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,719
representing the voice command when we

208
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,159
aim this laser at the microphone port of

209
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
a voice controllable system

210
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
it responds to the light as if someone

211
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,960
had spoken the command

212
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,880
in order to measure the vulnerability of

213
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
voice controllable systems we obtained

214
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,319
17 different devices and performed two

215
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,080
sets of experiments

216
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,360
in the first experiment we used a very

217
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
controlled environment to measure the

218
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
minimum optical power that was required

219
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,080
for the vcs to recognize different

220
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
commands

221
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
to ensure laser beam accuracy and

222
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
precision we used scanning mirrors to

223
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,799
allow us to perform precise and

224
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,600
consistent aiming of the laser at the

225
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
microphone ports

226
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,520
in the second set of experiments we

227
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,799
sought to investigate the maximum range

228
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,960
of the attack

229
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
to do this we added optics to the laser

230
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,680
in the form of a telephoto lens

231
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,360
this piece of equipment was around 300

232
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
but greatly reduced the beam area at

233
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
longer ranges

234
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
if you remember from earlier when we

235
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,360
reduced the beam area the light

236
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,759
irradiance increases

237
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,120
making the attack more effective we

238
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,800
tested two scenarios

239
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
one where an attacker only has access to

240
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
a five milliwatt laser equivalent to

241
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,960
taking a diode out of a laser pointer

242
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
we were able to test this in 110 meter

243
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,000
hallway

244
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
in the second scenario we moved up to a

245
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
60 milliwatt laser

246
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960
and fired it in a shorter 50 meter

247
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,400
hallway we had to do this

248
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
in a shorter hallway because of safety

249
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,919
concerns and using potentially harmful

250
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,719
lasers

251
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,919
and here are the results first notice

252
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
that these four devices

253
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
including the google home and echo plus

254
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,840
first generation required less than five

255
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
milliwatts of optical power to recognize

256
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,638
commands

257
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,240
we could inject signals into two of

258
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,400
these devices at the maximum range of

259
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
our 110 meter hallway

260
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,679
next notice that the majority of the

261
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
remaining devices were all vulnerable at

262
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,080
the max range of 50 meters

263
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
at the higher power 60 milliwatt laser

264
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
this includes the more modern echo dots

265
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
and the google nest camera

266
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,639
finally the results show that phones and

267
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
tablets are the least vulnerable to

268
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
these attacks

269
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,919
where we can only affect them at a range

270
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,520
between 5 and 20 meters

271
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,520
after seeing we could inject signals

272
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,440
from long range we moved on to perform a

273
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
cross-building attack to demonstrate how

274
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,280
a real world attack may look

275
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,719
we took our setup to a bell tower 70

276
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
meters from our office building

277
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
where we placed a google home in the

278
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,840
office behind a glass window

279
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,360
we used a telescope to aim and focus

280
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,520
and here you can see the demonstration

281
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
of the attack uh from up top in the

282
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
tower we're injecting the command

283
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
okay google open the garage door

284
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,318
injecting it into the laser where it is

285
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
being focused

286
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
by the telephoto lens and aimed at a

287
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,679
google home in the office building 70

288
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,039
meters away

289
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,199
we're aiming directly at the microphone

290
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,760
port and through a window so let's hear

291
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,279
it responds

292
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,200
okay opening and it hurt it

293
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,200
if you want to see more our other demos

294
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
and videos are posted at

295
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,080
lightcommands.com

296
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
so what are the consequences of this

297
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,399
attack well since we can inject

298
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
arbitrary commands into a vcs target

299
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,320
the consequences depend heavily on the

300
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
power of the victim's voice

301
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,519
if the victim's voice can disable and

302
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
enable various smart devices around the

303
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
home

304
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
then so can the attacker if the victim

305
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
can make online purchases with voice

306
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
than soaking the attacker

307
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,640
we found several ways that voice can be

308
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
used to open smart locks

309
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
open garage doors or even unlock cars

310
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
remotely

311
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
it all depends on what commands the

312
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,920
victim has set up to interface with

313
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,439
their devices

314
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,120
we successfully performed all of these

315
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
attack scenarios so please refer to our

316
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,279
paper for the detailed description of

317
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,479
what can be done with light commands

318
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
after exploring what we can do with

319
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
light commands it is important to

320
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
discuss the limitations of the attack

321
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
during our experiments we found that the

322
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
success of the attack is strongly

323
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
dependent on

324
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
laser focusing aiming environmental

325
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
acoustic noise

326
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,200
and audio quality of the injected

327
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959
recording if any one of these factors is

328
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
changed even slightly the success rate

329
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,839
drops drastically

330
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
it's also important to realize that we

331
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
need line of sight to pull off the

332
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760
attack

333
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,199
light will not diffract or reflect in

334
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,720
the same way that sound does

335
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
meaning that if we have no line of sight

336
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,360
on the microphone port then the attack

337
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
will not work

338
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,120
this is especially important as many

339
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
vcs's have microphones on the top of the

340
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
device

341
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,680
which are difficult to target with a

342
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,760
laser finally without special equipment

343
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,880
the attacker will have no audio feedback

344
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,800
making it difficult to respond

345
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,880
dynamically to protective measures such

346
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120
as liveness tests

347
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,399
now how can we prevent these attacks

348
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
there are two main approaches we can

349
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
take

350
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,720
one utilizing the hardware already

351
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,920
present we can take several software

352
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
approaches

353
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
stronger authentication mechanisms for

354
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
privileged commands will already help

355
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
greatly

356
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
liveness tests in the form of simple

357
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,360
randomized questions are also a strong

358
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
option as an attacker has no audio

359
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440
feedback from the target

360
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,640
finally since these devices have already

361
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
have multiple microphones

362
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
sensor fusion techniques may be used to

363
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
detect if one of the microphones is

364
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
under laser attack

365
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,959
it increases the complexity of the

366
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,200
attack if multiple microphones need to

367
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,800
be injected simultaneously

368
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,399
looking to the future hardware changes

369
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
should be made with a focus on blocking

370
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,560
light from entering the microphone port

371
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,720
this can be done at a device level with

372
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,319
fabrics but it can also be done within

373
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,839
the mems microphone itself as

374
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
demonstrated by certain microphone

375
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,880
designs that block

376
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,079
quick pressure spikes but also block

377
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,079
light from directly entering the

378
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,760
microphone port

379
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,199
this research opens up several different

380
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
avenues of future work

381
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
a good next step is to deeply explore

382
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
the physical causality of the attack

383
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,240
as strong models of the physical effects

384
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,839
on the microphone may lead to clues

385
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,760
about future defenses

386
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
this attack is also not limited to mems

387
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
microphones as we have some

388
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,360
results on larger electric condenser

389
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,959
microphones there may also be some

390
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
effects on other motion sensors such as

391
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,279
gyroscopes and accelerometers

392
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,640
leading to new vulnerabilities if you're

393
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
interested to look into the related

394
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
works about voice controllable systems

395
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
please see these other works

396
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,240
investigating the security of these

397
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,800
devices

398
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
finally to summarize lasers can inject

399
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
commands into voice controllable

400
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
systems this can be accomplished at long

401
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,519
range and with low optical power

402
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
this is possible due to a physical

403
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,959
vulnerability in mems microphones and

404
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
highlights the security flaws present in

405
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
voice controllable systems

406
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
especially the blind trust of their

407
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
microphone inputs finally

408
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
we should be aware of the power that is

409
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,399
given to the voice
