welcome to the presentation of sunrise

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
to sunset

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,959
our paper in which we analyze the

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
end-to-end life cycle and effectiveness

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,960
of large scale phishing attacks

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,560
my name is adam ost and this is joint

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,240
work together with my co-authors at

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,519
arizona state university

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,278
as well as paypal and google phishing is

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,320
a significant threat against the online

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
ecosystem

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
despite advancements and mitigations

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
against malicious websites

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,559
over the past several years pressure

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
from phishing attacks has been

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,919
increasing

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,599
even as web-based malware sites decline

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
as shown on this figure from google safe

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,079
browsing

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
here's an example of a typical phishing

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,718
website which might be distributed at

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
scale to a large set of victims

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
in this case the website impersonates a

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
webmail login and it has the same look

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,000
and feel

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
as the legitimate one however we observe

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
that the domain in this case

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
is quite different that gives away that

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
it's a phishing attack

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,080
as part of our background research into

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
modern phishing attacks

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,679
we inspected a large sample of live

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
phishing websites

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
looking at the source code we found that

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,119
these websites often embed javascript

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
tracking code or images

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,560
that are hosted on external servers for

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
example

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
on the phishing website from the

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,000
previous slide we observed that

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
three of the requests actually go to the

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
server of the organization that's being

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
impersonated

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
if we are able to collect these web

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,640
events we might be able to track the

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,119
activity

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,400
of victims visiting various phishing

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,360
websites

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
however to obtain this data one needs to

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,840
be an organization

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
that's actually targeted and

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
impersonated by fishers

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,520
we collaborated with one such

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,720
organization and built out a framework

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,320
that could be used for this analysis

56
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
web traffic data corresponding to

57
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,398
potential victims is of course sensitive

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,920
so we made sure that all the data that

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
we used in this research was fully

60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
anonymized

61
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,559
and we discussed this in more detail in

62
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,640
the paper now

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
to build this analysis framework we

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,600
start with the database of anonymized

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,079
web events

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
obtained from one organization targeted

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
by fishers

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
we then collect known phishing or

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,079
suspicious urls

70
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,599
from other data sources and continuously

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,239
we correlate these with domains

72
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,079
found in anonymized web events this

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,360
allows us to map out traffic from

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
potential victims

75
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
crawlers and also attackers visiting

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,640
those fishing websites

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,760
this also allows us to generate a

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,518
timeline

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,840
of the attack as well as potential

80
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,319
detections we'll go back to that in more

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
detail

82
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,359
later in this presentation

83
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
now that we have this timeline we can

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
also take session identifiers from the

85
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
web data

86
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
and correlate it with the organization's

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
fraud data

88
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,399
this enables loss calculations and the

89
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,799
ability to secure any accounts that

90
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,760
might have been affected by phishing

91
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,040
simultane simultaneously we take email

92
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,040
data into account

93
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
from an email provider or phishing

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
report sent by users

95
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,319
you might be able to map the timing of

96
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
spam and

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,560
trends from users reporting these

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,119
phishing websites

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,040
now let's build a timeline and look at

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,799
how we can use these data sources to do

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,959
so

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,879
the first step of phishing attack is

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,319
configuration of that website by the

104
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
attacker

105
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,238
and data on this can be captured from

106
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
the anonymized web events

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,360
for example if an attacker visits the

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,840
phishing websites for testing purposes

109
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,840
next attackers start targeting victims

110
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
for example by beginning an email spam

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
campaign

112
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,159
this data would be captured by the email

113
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,239
data set from the framework

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,319
once those emails start going out

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,159
victims may click on them and visit the

116
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,159
phishing websites this would then

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,480
correspond to web events

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,480
collected by the web event data source

119
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
over the course of the coming hours and

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,280
days attackers may start monetizing or

121
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,518
attempt to monetize

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,840
the stolen credentials and other data

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,439
obtained from the phishing websites

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,160
there may be indications of this

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,719
from the organization's fraud data once

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,639
the attack is detected by the ecosystem

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
mitigations may be enacted and

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
eventually the attack will go offline

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
either as a result of security efforts

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
or simply

131
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
by the fisher's own choice both of these

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
events

133
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,119
may also be captured by the web event

134
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,320
data source

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
now i'd like to talk about our

136
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,599
deployment of this framework and the

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,520
resulting data set

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,759
we refer to this as the golden hour data

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,198
set and the golden hour framework

140
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,680
we obtained the data from a large

141
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,040
organization currently one of the top 10

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,759
most phished organizations in the

143
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,560
ecosystem between october 2018

144
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
and september 2019. we found that our

145
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
data set had

146
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,560
web events corresponding to 39.1 percent

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
of known phishing domains during this

148
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,520
period which means that we had good

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
visibility

150
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,758
into over one-third of all known

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,919
phishing attacks

152
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,320
looking at the data set we found a total

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,320
of 15.6 potential victims

154
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,639
who visited fission websites or were

155
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,280
referred from fishing websites

156
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,000
and 4.8 million of those were known to

157
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
the organization

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
based on the visibility figure we can

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,160
estimate that for this organization

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,960
a total of almost 40 million potential

161
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,479
victims were targeted

162
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,198
if we look at successful phishing

163
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,400
attacks based on the fraud data

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,039
we observed that there was a 7.6

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
phishing success rate with an estimated

166
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
total of 1.2 million

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,440
victims that were likely to have been

168
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,280
successfully fished

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
now by aggregating all of the data

170
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,799
captured by the golden hour framework we

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,240
are able to build an end-to-end timeline

172
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
of phishing attacks

173
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
the center of the graph represents the

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
time at which each respective fishing

175
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
domain was marked as malicious by an

176
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,479
anti-phishing system

177
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,960
however if we rewind we observe that

178
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,159
9 hours and 42 minutes before then was

179
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,919
the average time

180
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
when an attacker actually visited the

181
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,080
fishing website for the purpose of

182
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,159
testing configuration shortly after then

183
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
the first phishing email would go out on

184
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
average

185
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
and victims would start visiting the

186
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,280
websites

187
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
then about 40 minutes before that

188
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,599
detection

189
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,199
is the point at which fifty percent of

190
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
victims have already visited fishing

191
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,360
websites

192
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
we observed that ninety percent of

193
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
victims visits

194
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
don't happen until eight hours after the

195
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
detection which means that despite the

196
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,000
detection and mitigation

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
there is still damage being done finally

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
based on the fraud data that was

199
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,759
collected an average of five days

200
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,560
elapses before a fraudulent transaction

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,560
happens

202
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,560
and an average of about seven days

203
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
before corresponding credentials were

204
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
found in a dump

205
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,680
now this framework allows us to do two

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,039
things the first thing is proactive

207
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
detection

208
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,240
if we have indicators of potential

209
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,719
phishing before

210
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,520
the ecosystem detections come in we can

211
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
actually

212
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,080
do something about it similarly

213
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,359
after the detection we can improve

214
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,960
reactive mitigations

215
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,120
such as browser-based mitigations

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,719
in our deployment we also secured the

217
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,599
affected user accounts such that

218
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
whenever we knew

219
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
that a known user visited a malicious

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,599
website

221
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,440
their account be protected so that the

222
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,120
username and password for example

223
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
would no longer be able to compromise

224
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,599
that account

225
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,800
we can also use the golden hour data set

226
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
to better understand

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
various mitigations and also to

228
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,039
understand the nature of modern phishing

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
attacks

230
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,719
the first thing we do is we estimate the

231
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,479
effectiveness of browser-based detection

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
we do this by comparing the ratio of

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,359
traffic from browsers that do have

234
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
anti-phishing features

235
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
with traffic from browsers that do not

236
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,800
and the browsers that do

237
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,280
are those that show warnings if you try

238
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
to visit a known phishing web page

239
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,198
this chart shows the relative attack

240
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
effectiveness over time

241
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
after the point that each attack is

242
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,719
detected and we observe

243
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,199
that a 50 decrease in effectiveness

244
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,759
occurs after about two hours

245
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,120
and just before the eight hour mark is

246
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,919
when the effectiveness of the phishing

247
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,400
attack

248
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,520
drops to a minimum between zero and ten

249
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
percent

250
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,799
however we still observe that there's

251
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,599
room for improvement here

252
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,280
because despite these mitigations

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,560
attackers are still able to compromise

254
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,319
victims

255
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
we also tackle this problem from an

256
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
empirical perspective

257
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,120
in another paper presented at this

258
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,880
conference

259
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,039
looking at the number of phishing urls

260
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,919
reported compared to the potential

261
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,240
victim traffic

262
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,800
observed by the golden hour dataset we

263
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,800
observed that increases or decreases

264
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,839
in phishing urls are not necessarily

265
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
correlated

266
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
with increases or decreases in victim

267
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,479
traffic in this case for example

268
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,320
in august there was a surge in victim

269
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
traffic even though

270
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,080
the urls were at a fairly low level this

271
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
means that it's important

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
to consider multiple variables when

273
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,040
analyzing phishing

274
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,720
not just the number of urls being

275
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,959
reported

276
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
based on the data set we looked at the

277
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,160
top 20 domains with the most potential

278
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,000
victims

279
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,240
we observed that some of these domains

280
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,519
had very long running phishing campaigns

281
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,240
some even up to almost 9 months

282
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,640
in addition these attacks had a variety

283
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
of

284
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,519
different types of urls and domains

285
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,080
ranging from compromised domains

286
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,480
free domains and also domains directly

287
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
registered by attackers

288
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
this means that the ecosystem should

289
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,040
prioritize these

290
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,440
large-scale high-impact attacks in fact

291
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
the top 20 phishing campaigns which we

292
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,279
group based on domain name

293
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
in this case accounted for almost a

294
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,720
quarter

295
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,439
of all the potential victims and if we

296
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,800
take the top

297
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
10 percent of top domains that's almost

298
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,439
90

299
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,440
of all of the victims this means that

300
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,480
the ecosystem should prioritize

301
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,279
these large-scale high-impact

302
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,880
fishing campaigns but how else can we

303
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,519
characterize this

304
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,120
in analyzing these campaigns we gain an

305
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
understanding of some of the techniques

306
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,680
that sophisticated phishing websites use

307
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,000
to bypass detection or mitigation

308
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,959
one technique is human verification in

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
this case

310
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,560
the victim would be presented with a

311
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
simple captcha and this might prevent an

312
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,599
anti-phishing system

313
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,599
from classifying the attack as malicious

314
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
we also observed that phishing attacks

315
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,279
carry out extensive identity theft

316
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,600
beyond just usernames and passwords

317
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,360
things such as credit cards addresses

318
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
phone numbers and even social security

319
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,279
numbers were very common among

320
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,920
top campaigns in addition

321
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,399
we observe the collection of identity

322
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,199
photos and identity documents

323
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,399
which even have a user-friendly flow and

324
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
demonstration

325
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
so that victims know exactly how they

326
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
should upload

327
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
their identities which is very

328
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
terrifying

329
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,160
to more easily convince victims these

330
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
phishing websites offer automatic

331
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
translation

332
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,360
so that depending on your browser

333
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,680
settings or your ip address

334
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
you will be shown the phishing website

335
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,479
in your local language

336
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,000
the victim provides all of the

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
information requested by the phishing

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
website

339
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,399
he or she might be shown a reassuring

340
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
message such as this typically

341
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,600
the victim will also be redirected back

342
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,040
to the legitimate website

343
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
in the golden hour data set we found

344
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,319
that these users were over 10 times more

345
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
likely to suffer a fraudulent

346
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920

347
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
the gold medal framework has enabled us

348
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
to take an end-to-end look at

349
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
large-scale phishing attacks

350
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,240
the key takeaway being that the

351
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
ecosystem should prioritize mitigating

352
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,600
sophisticated phishing attacks which

353
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
seem to be responsible

354
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
for a substantial proportion of damage

355
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,439
the golden hour system has been deployed

356
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
at a major organization

357
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
and is currently being used to secure

358
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,839
user accounts and proactively discover

359
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,880
new phishing urls in addition it has

360
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,279
been very helpful

361
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,480
in tracking covid19 related phishing

362
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,399
campaigns which surged earlier this year

363
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,839
in future work we believe that an

364
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,720
approach similar to this

365
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
can be used as part of a collaborative

366
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,240
cross-organizational framework

367
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,320
which might include additional data or

368
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,240
the incorporation of signals beyond

369
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
web requests which can of course be

370
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
evaded by attackers

371
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
thank you very much for listening and

372
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,839
please feel free to send me an email

373
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
