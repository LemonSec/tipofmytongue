1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,000
hello everyone i'm zane from uc davis

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
and i'm here to tell you about boxer a

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,759
system we built

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,198
to prevent credit card fraud with boxer

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
you can scan a credit card with an app

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
on your phone

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,400
to prove that the card is genuine but

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
before we talk about credit card fraud

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,479
i want to tell you the story of how this

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,159
research began

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
when i first started my phd a couple of

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
years ago unlike any good phd student

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,519
who would comb through past usenix and

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
oakland papers for inspiration

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,719
i chose to comb through my netflix

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,879
suggestions

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
and i found this old movie from the 90s

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,718
called donnie brasco

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
let me show you a little clip here which

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
serves as a good inspiration for this

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
work

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
to set the scene we have down the

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,599
jeweler on the left his job is to middle

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
diamonds

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
and lefty a local thug comes by and asks

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
don

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,440
to middle a diamond for him as soon as i

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
saw this clip i was sold

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,760
i wanted to be don the jeweler the slick

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,080
back hair sideburns brooklyn accent

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,039
the entire ensemble except the mustache

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,880
of course

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
because you can see how quickly he was

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,839
able to make the decision

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,159
as soon as he looked at the diamond he

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,240
knew immediately was fake

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
i figured i could set up a shop in davis

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,360
all the local thugs can come to me and

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,799
i'll middle diamonds for them tell them

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,520
which ones are fake which ones are real

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
everything is said

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,039
the problem is i don't know anything

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,799
about gems

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,119
well that's okay phd is all about

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,159
learning maybe i could enroll in this

46
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,200
graduate gemology program

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,439
well not only is this looking hard

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
it's not offered in davis and i like

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,720
living in the bustling metropolis that

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
is davis

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
so maybe i don't look at gems maybe i

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
look at something that i know

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,520
more of maybe i look at credit cards

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
instead

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
now before we get into the presentation

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,079
i want to play down the jeweler with you

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
guys

58
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,119
so i have four credit cards here and one

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
of these is real

60
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
the other three are fakes or for casey's

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
you're down the jeweler and your job is

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
to pick the real credit card

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,639
i'll give you 10 seconds look carefully

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,639
and pick the real card

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,040
if you like you can comment on the slack

66
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,200
thread of this paper if there exists one

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,920
with your choice and if you're right

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,760
i'll send you a fugazi

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,839
all right your 10 seconds start

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
now

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
alright time's up the one on the bottom

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,040
right is the real card and everything

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
else is for gazi

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,400
so what we did here is we got a lot of

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,760
credit card numbers and we designed a

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,440
machine learning system that can take

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,200
these numbers and put it in a realistic

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,280
image

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,399
now remember the goal of what we're

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,080
trying to do is to

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,440
detect fake credit cards and i just

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
showed you a very very

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,159
very realistic system for how to create

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,560
fake credit cards

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,159
so then the question is given that we

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
know that this system exists

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,519
how can we detect really high quality

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
figs

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
to know more on this i encourage you to

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,238
read our paper

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,120
but i never really mentioned why we care

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
well cardinal president fraud happens

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,519
when

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
fraudsters steal credit card credentials

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,040
of other people

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
and then use these credentials to make

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,879
purchases online or via an app without

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
the physical card

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
now remember card present transactions

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
when you go to your local grocery store

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
and make a transaction with your

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,200
physical card using a payment terminal

103
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
while card not present transactions when

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
you make a purchase via an app

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,679
by keying in the credentials without

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,760
using a physical card

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
here are some alarming numbers the

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
x-axis represents the year and

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,280
the y-axis represents the losses in

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
millions of dollars

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
on the left we have card present fraud

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,359
and on the right we have card not

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,040
present fraud

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,799
you can see while the card present fraud

115
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,599
is decreasing in recent years card not

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
present fraud is increasing

117
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,079
in fact researchers estimate that

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,920
retailers will lose 130 billion dollars

119
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
to cardinal prison fraud in the next few

120
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,119
years

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,839
and to prevent this we present

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
boxer

123
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,358
so boxer is a client-side sdk and a

124
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
server to deter

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,039
card not present fraud so how does it

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,919
work

127
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,080
well here is how a food delivery app can

128
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,080
use boxer to verify a credit card for a

129
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,320
suspicious transaction

130
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
first the food delivery app detects a

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,080
suspicious transaction

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,560
and rather than blocking it they forward

133
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,198
the user to boxer's card scanner

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,720
boxers scanner scans the user's card

135
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,040
performs ocr

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
analyzes video frames to detect telltale

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
signs of attacks

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and collects signals from the device

139
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,400
before

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
sending this data to the box or server

141
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
boxer server decides if the card is

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440
genuine

143
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,080
and if it is instructs the app to allow

144
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080
the transaction to proceed

145
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
boxer combines image analysis device

146
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,599
signals and rule aggregation server

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,039
to provide a holistic solution to fraud

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
in the remainder of the presentation

149
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
i'll first talk about boxer's image

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
analysis

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,280
and how boxer collects device signals

152
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,280
this will be followed by the guiding

153
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,239
design principles evaluation and real

154
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
world impact

155
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,680
and afterwards i will conclude

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
the first model in boxer's image

157
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
analysis pipeline is ocr

158
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
ocr is how we extract a card number out

159
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
of a video stream when a user scans

160
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,800
their card

161
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,719
in boxer ocr serves as the baseline of

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
our defense where we use the scan card

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
number

164
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,880
to match against the card number that

165
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,360
the app has on record

166
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
while easily available ocr acts as a

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
first line of defense extracting useful

168
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,599
information for our more advanced models

169
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
ocr is followed by bin check the bin is

170
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
the first

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
six digits of the card number and

172
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,960
identifies the issuing bank

173
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
say bank of america bin check our second

174
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
line of defense

175
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,679
uses the bin and the visual design

176
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
elements of the card to check if they

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
match

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,600
for instance the image on the slide has

179
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
a green dot bin

180
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,000
but it has no design elements like

181
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,440
payment network or bank name etc

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,759
hence insufficient visual information

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,840
similarly similarly the image at the

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
bottom has a green dot bin but a chase

185
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,599
logo

186
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,759
hence inconsistent visual information

187
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
boxer spin check is designed to catch

188
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,240
both insufficient

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,359
and inconsistent scanner credit cards

190
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
boxer also has a screen detection module

191
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
to detect cards scanned from computer

192
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,560
phone or tablet screens

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,318
with this check an attacker would have

194
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
to physically print

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
credit card information before scanning

196
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
screen detection

197
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,319
detects screen edges or reflections as

198
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,479
artifacts of cards scanned off screens

199
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
it also detects more intrinsic signs

200
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,639
like multi patterns

201
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,400
which are an aliasing effect arising

202
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,240
from an overlay of two different

203
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,840
patterns on top of each other

204
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,080
the general purpose of screen detection

205
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,359
is to detect any false medium

206
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,919
rendering an image to collect device

207
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,319
signals

208
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,680
boxer forces the attacker to use genuine

209
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
hardware and the real

210
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,000
app with device check internally device

211
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,080
check uses hardware

212
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
backed tokens stored on the device by

213
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,960
the manufacturer

214
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,880
to verify that it is genuine boxer also

215
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,960
consists of a secure counter to prevent

216
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,240
hardware-based attacks at scale

217
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,080
given that boxer forces attackers into

218
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,759
using legitimate hardware devices

219
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,198
attackers will try to repeat the same

220
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,880
attacks with the same physical hardware

221
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
for instance attackers may try to use

222
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
many stolen credit cards with the same

223
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
physical device

224
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,120
since procuring fresh devices is

225
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
expensive

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,879
boxer can securely count the number of

227
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
cards added per device and thus rate

228
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,080
limit an attacker

229
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,520
to prevent large-scale hardware-based

230
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,878
attacks

231
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,240
boxer secure counter is a general

232
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,759
purpose counter which can be used to

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
count other events as well like

234
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,280
number of accounts registered using the

235
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,879
same device

236
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,479
additionally boxer's secure counter is

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
privacy preserving since it only

238
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,599
identifies classes of devices

239
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,560
and not each individual device from a

240
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,719
higher level

241
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
with boxer we break down the fraud

242
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,560
detection into multiple stages guided by

243
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
our design principles

244
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
these principles can be grouped into two

245
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
high-level categories

246
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,360
the first three principles inform our

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
image analysis

248
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
design while the last two guide our

249
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,400
device signals design

250
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
concretely with ocr we we scan the card

251
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,199
to extract relevant

252
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,718
relevant details and check what's on

253
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,959
record with bin check we inspect the

254
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
card image for telltale signs of

255
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,919
tampering

256
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
with screen detection we detect ways of

257
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,439
rendering fake card images with device

258
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,959
check we force the attacker to use

259
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,640
genuine hardware

260
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
and finally with secure counter we

261
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,839
associate attacker activities with

262
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,959
things that are expensive for rate

263
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,519
limiting

264
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,199
to evaluate boxer's net impact

265
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
end-to-end in the production app

266
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,040
we report the results from an app that

267
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,359
allowed users flagged by their system to

268
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,319
verify themselves with boxer

269
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
for two weeks in feb 2020 45 users were

270
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,279
sent to boxer

271
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,279
for verification 35 of these users

272
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,920
failed the boxers ocr and were blocked

273
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,080
by boxer a manual review by the app

274
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,079
later confirmed all 35 users were in

275
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
fact fraudsters

276
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
of the remaining users eight pass box

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,279
has challenges and

278
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,880
and were allowed to transact a manual

279
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
review by the app later confirmed

280
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,279
boxer's decisions to be accurate

281
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
of the remaining two users one was

282
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,519
caught by boxer's secure counter

283
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,279
and the other was flocked by a flag by

284
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,440
boxer's screen detection

285
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
the user caught by secure counter was a

286
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,959
fraudster while the user flagged by

287
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,279
screen detection was a false positive

288
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,199
to summarize boxer recovered 89 of the

289
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,360
app's legitimate users without incurring

290
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
any additional fraud

291
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
boxer is currently actively swapping

292
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
fraud in production

293
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,640
so far 323 apps have integrated boxer

294
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,319
and many of them have deployed boxer in

295
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
production resulting in boxers scanning

296
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,680
over 10 million cars already

297
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,519
to conclude we first introduced boxer a

298
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,359
client-side sdk and a server for

299
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
preventing cardinal present fraud

300
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
boxer combines multiple image analysis

301
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,680
techniques with the novel secure

302
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,920
accounting abstraction to provide

303
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,399
holistic solutions to cardinal present

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,719
fraud attacks and boxer has been

305
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,560
integrated into 323 apps it has scanned

306
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,760
over 10 million cards already and is

307
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,199
currently actually stopping fraud

308
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
that is it from us if you have any

309
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
questions you can email your questions

310
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
the email address is mentioned in the

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,839
slide

312
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
thank you for your attention
