00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,280
hello

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,440
everyone welcome to my talk my name is

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
the title of my thought today is

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,600
liveness is not enough

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,840
enhancing fingerprint authentication

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,199
with the behavioral biomatrix

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,560
to defeat puppet attacks this is a joint

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
work with my advisors

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,120
from ohio university and its means from

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,120
rochester institute of technology

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,399
usa in recent years

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,199
fingerprints have been widely integrated

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,680
on smartphones and tablets among

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
exhaustive authentication massive

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
fingerprint authentication is the most

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,559
brilliant

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,680
sense to its highest ability fingerprint

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,199
authentication is

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,239
also used in security critical scenarios

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,239
such as online payment smartphone unlock

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,000
however fingerprint authentication is

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
vulnerable

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to plantation attacks where the system

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,439
is spoofed by

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,680
artificial crafts well for this attack

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,119
the existing solution is lavish

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
detection

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,320
hardware-based masses rely on additional

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
hardware to determine the

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,520
life science of the input fingerprint

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,720
such as humidity body pressure

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,840
others may focus on details of

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,200
the captured fingerprint

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,600
such as ridge size density community and

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,240
texture it use image processing messages

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
to instruct more describe 18 features

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
unfortunately it is the message to

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
enhance the

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,479
security of fingerprint authentication

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,920
only focus on live new detection

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,640
it determines whether the input

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,759
fingerprint comes from a live human

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
being

44
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,480
those systems are parties against an

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,120
overlooked puppy attack

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,119
in this attack the attacker placed an

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,560
unwearing victim's finger

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,440
on the fingerprint sensor public attack

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
was also

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
highlighted in iso iec standard

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,319
documents

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,200
and of increasing concern since

53
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,200
is easy to conduct this attack

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,440
actually since the fingerprint and other

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,040
lavender

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
sun are collected from the rear and the

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,519
legitimate user

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,160
in puppet attacks existing

59
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,040
live needs detaching message or fail in

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,359
defeating public attacks

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,440
to defend against or plantation attacks

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,000
including the private attacks

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,560
we use the intrinsic figure touch

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,920
characteristics to model use movements

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,319
in legitimate authentications

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,200
figurative touch is the behavior

67
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
completed

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
in a instant when user gets gets the

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,840
mobile device

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,399
in hand and applies his finger to the

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,560
sensor

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
we model those movements with

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
accelerations

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,319
and the rotation angles which can be

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,959
retrieved from built-in sensors

76
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,238
such as accelerometer magnetometer and

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,080
gyroscope

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,560
overall the basic idea is to complement

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
fingerprint authentication with

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,200
fingertip

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,359
touch behavioral characteristics

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,720
our system runs in the background to

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
monitor the

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,959
fingerprint authentication event once

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,239
detected

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,120
fingerprint input either it starts to

87
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,560
cut data from accelerometer gyroscope

88
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
and the magnet parameter

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
with the sensor data is then

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,879
characterized

91
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,080
fingertip touch behavior using

92
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,399
accelerations and

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
rotation angles around three axis

94
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
for the feature extraction we installed

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
two kinds of

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
features include including time and

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,839
frequency domain features and the same

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
base features

99
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,440
for same basic features we covered the

100
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,080
temperature is

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,840
to power special density using short

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,680
time fourier transform and

103
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
then using base feature weapon

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,280
representation

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
to extra features

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,199
to profile legitimate users with only

107
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,919
successful login data points

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
approach to a machine learning model

109
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,440
based

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,599
on the one class class file which is

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,600
later used for authentication

112
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,560
we first share the features in the time

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,000
and the frequency domain

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,039
specifically we faster you shadow

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
6 statistical features in the time

116
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,759
domain

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
including mean standard deviation

118
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,400
relative state division

119
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
sum of absolute differences absolute

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,320
energy

121
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,199
and the auto correlation in addition

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,840
we apply faster for real transform and

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
instead

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,039
another six features in the top

125
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,960
frequency domain

126
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,719
those features include spatial centroid

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,758
spread skewness ketosis port density

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
and entropy

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
besides the time and the frequency

130
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,159
domain features

131
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,719
we also use chat features with the cm

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
based

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,880
feature learning we first apply

134
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,680
short time free transform to cover the

135
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
time series

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,960
to power special density

137
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,159
matrices the figure shells shows

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,039
poor spatial density matrices of three

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,039
different users

140
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,799
two is strategy same basic features with

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,000
the basic idea is to use

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,639
the output of the prediction

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,919
models intermediate layer as the

144
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,520
features

145
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,318
this is due to the powerful feature

146
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,719
representation of neural network in our

147
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,520
work

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,479
we faster by change the cm model to

149
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,960
distinguish

150
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,840
different users with clarity the

151
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,799
behavior data

152
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,119
then we use the model but the last layer

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
as

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,319
the feature extractor

155
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,240
in real world in no other

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,360
fingerprint authentication services the

157
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,960
data set only content data points

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,280
come from the legitimate user

159
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,560
so is a one class classification problem

160
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,479
in our work we consider four different

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,639
class files including ps pearson

162
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
coefficient based on the similarity

163
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,199
comparison

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,319
one class support vector machine local

165
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,400
ordinary

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,280
factor and isolation forest

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,239
we also compare their performance in our

168
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,239
evaluations

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
in our data collection 90 subjects were

170
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
involved in

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,199
figurative touch behavioral data

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,080
collection who are aged from

173
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,639
22 to 45 39 subjects were female and

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,758
the others were male during the data

175
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,919
collection

176
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
we asked each subject to hold a

177
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,318
smartphone

178
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
in hand as the normally unlocked their

179
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
own device

180
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
stable summarizes the compiled for

181
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,160
datasets

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,280
this l1 was carried in different

183
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
postures

184
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,638
and there's two the test points were

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,919
collected

186
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,240
in different appearances for their ss3

187
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,758
we collected their points on three more

188
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
smartphones

189
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,360
in data center 4 another 15 subjects

190
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,719
including

191
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,520
four fan females and the lower males

192
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,400
were recruited to play the law of an

193
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,359
attacker

194
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,318
to cut all the artificial replica tag

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,000
public attack

196
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,960
and mimicry attack on previous

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,960
90 subjects

198
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,440
for reliability evaluation we used

199
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,679
three feature sets including time and

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,719
the frequency domain feature setup

201
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,239
same based feature set and the unit of

202
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,519
two cells

203
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,599
on the different chinese sides cast

204
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
files and the feature says

205
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,200
we found that using love as the cast

206
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,839
file

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
the combination of love and the unf can

208
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,800
achieve almost

209
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,279
the best performance

210
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,959
while in practical fingerprint

211
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,279
authentication systems

212
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,640
the performance equation focus more

213
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,320
attention on

214
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,800
force acceptance lead for example

215
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,760
the force acceptance leader can achieve

216
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,880
a sixth part of defeat of ten

217
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,160
while the first rejection rate is one

218
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,200
person

219
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,439
thus we think the combination of safe

220
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,959
and

221
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,480
love outperforms uf and lawful

222
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:32,560
due to a lower force rejection

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,560
first acceptance rate of 0.86 percent

224
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,319
for security evaluation of plantation

225
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,480
attacks

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,760
we used attack samples from 15 attackers

227
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
who aimed to bypass our method in this

228
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,880
part

229
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,640
we focused on fourth acceptance rate and

230
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,320
the prediction score

231
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,080
the fourth acceptance rate on the

232
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,760
artificial republic

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,560
attack and the puppet attack were almost

234
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,959
the same while the popular attack shows

235
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,760
lower petition score

236
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,239
on the mimicry attack force acceptance

237
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
rate

238
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,839
can be higher but with lower petitions

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,399
courses although

240
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,839
we took a great effort to maintain our

241
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,959
studies

242
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,320
day where there are some limitations

243
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,920
in our system for example behavioral

244
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,720
wearability and the different

245
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
postures may include additional force

246
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
rejection

247
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,199
and undermine the usability and the

248
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,720
robustness of our method

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,040
besides our message requires the user

250
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,600
to handhold the device during the

251
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,959
authentic authentication

252
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,240
if the device is placed on the desktop

253
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,160
or phone blocked stationarity

254
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,399
or method will fail to work in addition

255
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
approach you may forcibly judge a

256
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,079
legitimate user use

257
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,519
he used one hand to reject register

258
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,000
his behavior one while the other hand to

259
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,160
perform
