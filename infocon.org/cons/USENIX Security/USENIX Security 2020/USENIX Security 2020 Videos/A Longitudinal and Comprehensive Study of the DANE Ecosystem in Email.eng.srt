00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,599
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm yamil lee from sour regional

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
university today

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,439
i present a paper or longitudinal and

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
comprehensive study of data network

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
system

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,000
in email as you know there were some

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,640
extent

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that cs were compromised this notar or

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
commodore compromised

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
nbc issued fake certificates for

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,238
well-known domains like google

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,719
there are so many shades and they can

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,078
issue certificates to anyone

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
can you trust are these yes to mitigate

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,480
this problem

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,718
counter measures like certificate

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,879
transparency or certification authority

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,039
authorization were suggested

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,320
however they do not fundamentally solve

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
the root problem

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,879
they still rely on cheats to issue and

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,599
verify certificates

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,519
then was suggested to address this issue

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
then what is

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,719
train is a security protocol that allows

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,879
certificates to be bound to domain names

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,040
domain owners can publish certificate

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,080
information as a dns record

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
called tls record then how does the

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
integrity of teracellular course

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,960
guarantee

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,520
by dnstec integrity and authenticity of

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,759
teracylers are guaranteed by dns

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,240
thus they enable steroids without

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,560
relying on sheets

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
then how does they work let's say we

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,720
host example.com

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
we also running dns server first we

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,479
publish

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,799
the cell records to our tns server if

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,520
some client wants to connect our domain

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
it fetches tls records through dns

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,158
reserver

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,600
but here the tsl record is protected by

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
dnse

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,039
thus the client actually fetches tls

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,360
records

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,520
and dns records such as rrc records

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
and then the client checks the integrity

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,759
of the cell records

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
by validating the insect chain i'll skip

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,880
the details of the answer

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
if you're interested in it please look

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,439
for other materials

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,318
and next the client gets a certificate

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,280
for tls

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,119
from the server and compares tlsl

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,520
records with the certificate

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
to check whether they are matched or not

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
if they are matched then our server is

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
authenticated

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,720
so the txt connection is set up

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,400
then where line is used theoretically

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,480
game can be applied anywhere tls is used

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
and it is known that day is widely used

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,119
with smtp

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,920
why simpler transfer protocol

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
smtp has no built-in script mechanism in

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
its initial design

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,959
thus the client cannot authenticate the

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,599
server and emails are sent in plain text

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,160
starters extension was proposed to

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,000
support

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,480
tls for smtp after tcp and check

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,879
the client send starters command to

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,359
express its tier support

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,560
if the server accepts it then negotiate

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
terrorists

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,959
however star tress is not vulnerable to

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
downgraded text

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,239
monotecture can intercept starches

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400
command

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
then the client thinks that the server

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
does not support starting s

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,518
thus sends email in plain text like

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
before

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
in here the challenge is that the client

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,440
cannot know whether the server supports

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,760
starters or not but with dane

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,480
the incentive server can explicitly tell

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
the clients

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,599
that is the first starters by publishing

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,680
tlc records

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
thus by checking whether the server has

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
tiered cell records

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,359
clients can know that the server

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,920
supports start headers

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,200
this figure shows how an smtp client can

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
authenticate an example

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
server using day the server publishes

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,680
tlc records to the dns

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,680
and the records are protected by dnsdec

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
the client gets a certificate through

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,200
30s and remaining process

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,200
is same with the previous example

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,760
as you can see four entities need to

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,159
cooperate to many state

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,798
authorities tip dnc in server site has

110
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,159
to publish

111
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,319
the cell records and dns set correctly

112
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,840
the answer delivering client side has to

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,279
fetch the selectors

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,840
and validate dsl records an incentive

115
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,159
server

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,758
must support searchers and provide

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
certificates

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,440
an incentive client must support the

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
star chats and verify

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,719
tera selectors with certificates in

121
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
short

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,960
entities in server side must support tsa

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
dns and start cherish correctly and

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,638
client-side entities

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
must fetch tennis cell records and sale

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,919
records

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,359
and certificates also have to verify

128
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,359
them

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
then can only function correctly when

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,080
all these entities fulfill their

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
responsibilities

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,400
to investigate server side gain

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,320
deployment we collected tna cell records

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
from five time level domains for about

135
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,599
two years every day

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,039
we scanned contrary code time level

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,440
domain start at c and

138
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,880
dna because they show high dns

139
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,120
deployment rate

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,080
using this data we checked how many

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,240
domains deployed then

142
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
next we measured if domains deployed

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,800
then how they manage it

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,759
for this we collected teresa records and

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,080
certificates

146
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,960
for about four months every hour with

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
this data

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,198
we checked with their domains correctly

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,840
support day

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,680
for client-side we investigated how many

151
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,159
popular email service providers

152
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
support day we checked whether these

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
email providers

154
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,320
correctly validate dns and hearsay

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
records

156
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,400
when they send email as a client

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,039
we also checked how popular mta and dns

158
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,120
programs

159
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,159
support dain this is the outline of our

160
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
analysis

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
first i'll show you the server side

162
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,039
analysis about then deployment and

163
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,479
management

164
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
next i'll show you the client-side

165
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,758
analysis about name supports from email

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,719
providers and software

167
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,199
let's start with 10 deployment right

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
figure shows ratio of domains with tsa

169
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
records

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,639
as you can see deployment rate is quite

171
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
low but increasing

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,560
for generic terrorists deployment rate

173
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,639
is less than one percent

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
but interestingly deployment rate for

175
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,120
retail dnl and high dsd

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,000
is very high about 40 percent of target

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
c domains

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
have terraced records in the last

179
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,280
snapshot

180
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,560
this is due to the financial incentives

181
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,960
from registries of these countries

182
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,080
also we found that the grosses may lead

183
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,120
you to some popular

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,599
email service providers for example the

185
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
biggest

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160
pipe is due to one.com stained

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
deployment one.com deployed 10 to its

188
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,360
mail servers

189
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,759
so rtrg's deployments were increased

190
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
in summary then deployment is low but

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
growing

192
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
then are these domains deployed then

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
correctly

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
to answer this question we analyzed data

195
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,680
management

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,359
to support dane domains have to deploy

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,520
dsl records like ds and rc records

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,160
also domains have to support the star

199
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,318
chats and provide certificates

200
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,280
but it is not sufficient to just support

201
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
them

202
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,758
they have to support them correctly dsl

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
records have to be cracked

204
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,039
and certificates must consistent with

205
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,280
corresponding tlc records

206
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,080
thus here we examine whether domains

207
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,758
with some necessary components

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,758
also we checked whether our components

209
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,599
are correct or not

210
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,880
as i mentioned before we additionally

211
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,880
collected tlc records and certificates

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
we collected data from five vantage

213
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
points all over the world

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,440
to minimize the network error according

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,280
to clients geography locations

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,840
and we found no difference between

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,080
vantage points

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
let's see missing components first for

219
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,599
dnsec

220
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,799
about 85 percent of the sale equals are

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,280
signed

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,280
but 20 percent of them do not have ts

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,280
records in their parent job

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,758
thus their dns chain cannot be validated

225
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,359
in star terrace we found that on average

226
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,199
99 percent of servers

227
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,240
support start years and only 0.01

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,919
percent of them

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,919
provides no or performed certificates

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,758
from this we can know that main failure

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,878
reason of correct time management

232
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
is missing ts records if you deployed

233
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,599
into your server

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
then you should be more careful about

235
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,559
dns records

236
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
next we checked whether compounds are

237
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,518
correct or not

238
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,838
for dnsec 0.55 percent of dsl records

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,959
are incorrect

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
starters about 3.68 percent of

241
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,680
certificates do not match with

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,760
corresponding theoretical records

243
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,760
in summary we liberate pervasive

244
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,680
mismanagement in the daily ecosystem

245
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,439
next i'll show you ten support from

246
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,680
client side

247
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
first we checked how many popular email

248
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,239
service providers support then

249
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,959
and correctly we checked whether email

250
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
providers

251
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,560
correctly validate tnsx and of course

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
when they send email as a client as i

253
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
mentioned before

254
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
client side entities have fetched tsa

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
and tenancy records

256
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
and certificates also they have to

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
validate them

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
to figure out this we have to make email

259
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,080
service providers

260
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
send email to us for this we set up a

261
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
test bed

262
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,120
we set up by nine and postfix servers

263
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,320
and purchase the second level domain

264
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,560
name

265
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
and sets of domains data is configured

266
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,518
to different combinations of

267
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,880
dns 3s and day for example

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:47,040
the nsx expired rc.intext.com

269
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,680
has expired our single records for tlsa

270
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,360
using this server we test 29 popular

271
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,359
email service providers

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,040
we sent an email to our sub domains

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
using these email providers

274
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
and check whether they've cheated tlc

275
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,000
records and certificates

276
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,600
and validate them let's see our

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
experiment process

278
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,320
first we set up an email account and

279
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,160
send an email to our sub domain

280
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,399
then the client-side density server

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,279
finds mx and teracellular course by

282
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,200
contacting our authority to keep dns

283
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,200
then our dns server checks whether the

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,880
reservoir cheat can set and cherish

285
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,959
their records

286
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,959
after then the client will initiate an

287
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,800
smtp connection

288
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,000
then our incentive server checks whether

289
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,079
the client sends a startup request

290
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,320
the server sends a certificate if the

291
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,640
client requests start hears

292
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,760
finally our smtp server checks whether

293
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,160
the sntp connection is established

294
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,880
if our soft domain is misconfigured then

295
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
the client

296
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,120
must not send an email

297
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,719
this table shows dns support of 29 email

298
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,880
service providers

299
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,079
first only seven email providers

300
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,079
actually send dns requests

301
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,519
and only four of them correctly delegate

302
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
can sell requests

303
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,959
this means that when you run mail

304
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
servers and deploy dns

305
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,279
but if the dns chain is broken then you

306
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,160
cannot receive mail from these four main

307
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,079
providers

308
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,880
because they correctly validate dsa

309
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,359
next for start heaters we found that 23

310
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,439
main providers support the star tres

311
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,920
which means that they fetch certificates

312
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
finally for tlsl records we found that

313
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,160
four main providers

314
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,680
fetch tenacil records and two of them

315
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,920
critically validate our fields

316
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,239
interested workers

317
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
other two providers do not validate one

318
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
field correctly

319
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,600
but they checked other fields correctly

320
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,399
so we mark them as yellow triangles in

321
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,480
the table

322
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
from this result we can know that their

323
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,000
support in the email service providers

324
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
is still in an early stage

325
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,800
finally we investigated popular mta and

326
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
das software

327
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,880
we investigated four popular mta

328
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,839
programs and found that our support

329
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,360
started

330
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,200
and 12 of them support today next we

331
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,839
examined 11gs programs

332
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,639
and found that they supported dnsec and

333
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,320
trsa

334
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,120
from this we can know that today's

335
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,320
support in the popular mti nts programs

336
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
is pervasive which is good news that mta

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,839
and ts programs

338
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:37,920
are ready to deploy

339
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:37,920
thank you
