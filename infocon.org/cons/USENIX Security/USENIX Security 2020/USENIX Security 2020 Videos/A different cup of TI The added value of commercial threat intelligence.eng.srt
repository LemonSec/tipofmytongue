1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,200
thank you for tuning in to this talk

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,840
about threat intelligence

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
my name is xander baumann i'm a phd

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
candidate at delft university of

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,640
technology in the netherlands

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
and i'm speaking on behalf of a team of

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,439
colleagues that carried out this work

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
from my institution from university of

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,000
potsdam and from

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,320
leiden university now let's say that

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,759
you've lost your car keys and in order

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,120
to find them back

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
three different private investigators

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,718
are offering their services

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
each of them is asking for a different

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
price and in order to know

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,320
who to hire you would have to know more

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
information about them

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
for example um what experience do these

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,960
investigators have

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
with similar cases or what special

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,680
capabilities do they have access to

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,760
to help find back your car keys

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,719
now um this is what we refer to as a

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
market with

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,960
asymmetric information the sellers know

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,158
what they are selling

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
but the buyers don't know what they are

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,960
buying a similar situation occurs

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,039
in the market for commercial threat

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
intelligence

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
we know from surveys that have been

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,960
carried out in the past

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
that um buyers in his market are

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
struggling to compare the different

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,240
commercial threat intel vendors that

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
asymmetry

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,039
is something that we are trying to

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,119
address with this work

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
threat intelligence um there's lots of

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
definitions this is our working

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,560
definition

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
um threat intelligence includes an ip

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
address

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,880
of a c2 server it includes a hash of

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,119
known malware

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
and it could come to you also in the

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,880
form of a report

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,919
a pdf written in natural language that

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,439
describes

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,920
the tactics of a certain

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,039
threat group for example how they carry

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
out phishing operations

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
an organization that wants to have

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
threat intelligence

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,839
could gather it from their own network

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,360
their own experiences

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,000
or they can get it from external sources

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
they can get us from open sources

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
meaning

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
that it's freely available on the web

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,520
such as blockless

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,879
they can get it from sharing societies

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
which can be as simple as

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,920
a slack community for example in which

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
information is exchanged on the base of

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,280
quid pro quo you give some

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,319
and you get some or you can

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,599
buy it commercially and

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,879
the third option the paid threat

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,720
intelligence is what we are assessing in

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
this paper

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,480
we are the first to describe these in

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,359
academic research

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,319
these paid sources um probably because

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,080
they are really expensive

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,839
some major providers as you see here on

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
the left ask upwards of one hundred

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
thousand

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
dollars per year um

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
and we speculate that this is the reason

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
why they're not described in academic

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,518
research yet

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
so we ask what do these services consist

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
of

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,040
are they different from open sources and

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
customers that have bought them in the

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,319
past what are they using these services

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,480
for

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:22,319
and how are they evaluating them

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,879
we analyzed the services

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
of two leading providers six years worth

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,440
of

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,359
their data we cannot identify

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,040
the vendors specifically that was the

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,200
condition on the base of which we could

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,959
carry out this research

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,319
but we can say that they are at the top

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
end of the market

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,518
and therefore we are confident in saying

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
that

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
these vendors are representative for

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,920
commercial threat intelligence as a

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,519
whole

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,159
further we compared those sources with

106
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
six open source block lists and also we

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,959
spoke to 14

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,080
professionals that are using paid threat

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
intelligence in their work

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
important limitations of our work

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
include that

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
we did a relative comparison only

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,239
meaning that

114
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,000
we did not attempt to compare to ground

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,120
truth

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
and also we analyzed our interviews uh

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
using grounded theory

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,680
meaning inductively and only

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,280
in order to contextualize our findings

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,800
we do not generalize to the

121
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,799
to the global population of security

122
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,960
specialists

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
if you're a customer of one of these

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,919
vendors that we have analyzed you might

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,840
receive on average

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,120
each month about 100 threat reports of

127
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,919
various flavors and also

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
500 machine readable indicators would be

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,080
attached to those reports

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
there are other intelligence products

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,758
listed here

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
that we described in the paper on the

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,000
left

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,198
you see an overview of the

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,280
sectors that the

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
vendors are saying are affected by the

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
threats that they describe in the

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
reports

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,680
so the third most prevalent sector is

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,840
civil society

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,039
which is surprising because civil

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,159
society

143
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,039
organizations are not really in a

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,360
position to pay for these expensive

145
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,719
trade intel sources and we speculate

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
that this is because

147
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
uh perhaps attacks against civil society

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,080
carry some

149
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,080
special political significance

150
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,159
so if two threat intelligence vendors

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,000
are describing the same threats

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,639
you might expect that they come up with

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,479
the same data but we find that this is

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,600
not the case

155
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,719
just 13 of the indicators of one of the

156
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
vendors shows up

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
in the data of the other vendor vice

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,599
versa it's only

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,080
1.3 percent so the sets of one of the

160
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
vendors was much larger

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,520
in order to better understand these

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,080
findings we looked at

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,599
22 threat actors that according to their

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,800
own metadata

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,199
these vendors are tracking and

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,880
specifically for these uh uh threat

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
actors we looked at what indicators were

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
available

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,120
in the sets of the ven of the vendors

170
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,159
um and how much overlap there was the

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
overlap between

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
um the different vendors the two vendors

173
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,360
is shaded in

174
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
the middle of these bars and on average

175
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,840
for

176
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
each of the indicator types there was no

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,159
more than four percent

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,840
overlap even for specific trap actors

179
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
that both of the vendors are saying

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,560
that they're tracking

181
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,919
this raises some questions about the

182
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
coverage that these vendors are

183
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,599
providing

184
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,440
so there's not so much overlap what does

185
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,800
that say about

186
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,639
the visibility that these vendors are

187
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,520
providing of the threat landscape as a

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,280
whole

189
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,318
or even for the specific threat actors

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,318
that they say they are targeting

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,159
now comparing with open sources

192
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
there are more differences

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
open sources are almost entirely

194
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,440
different there's almost no overlap

195
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,120
and this indicates that commercial

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,319
threat intelligence really does capture

197
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,960
a different part of the trap landscape

198
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,240
um in terms of timeliness we did a

199
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,159
comparison

200
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
which we have to say was based on this

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
very small overlap

202
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,120
and it shows delays both ways of about

203
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
one month

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,119
there was no evidence that the paid

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
indicators were

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
faster but again this was based on this

207
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,599
very small overlap

208
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,280
in terms of substance looking at those

209
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,319
reports

210
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,119
we saw that actually these reports often

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,919
included

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
also open source information so a paid

213
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,080
report might include

214
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
information from a independent security

215
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
researcher's blog

216
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,440
or we even saw screenshots of tweets

217
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
directly being copied into reports

218
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,000
we spoke to customers of these

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
commercial sources

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,840
and they described open sources as the

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,800
raw

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,280
intel versus the paid sources as the

223
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
polished

224
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,919
intel

225
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,120
previous research has identified all

226
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,520
kinds of

227
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
performance metrics for block lists and

228
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,479
for trade intelligence

229
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,759
feeds um again

230
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,919
this is also why i'm speaking about

231
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,840
coverage but customers don't actually

232
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,640
seem to care so much about coverage

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,880
they are not optimizing for detection um

234
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,039
customers are

235
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,799
actually not talking about metrics at

236
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,799
all so much only half of the customers

237
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,120
mention metrics

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,919
by themselves but if they mention

239
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,800
metrics

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,880
it's almost always false positives and

241
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,240
it seems that the customers in this

242
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,839
market are not so much

243
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,680
optimizing for maximizing detection

244
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
or minimizing false negatives but really

245
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,239
they're optimizing for the workflow

246
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,440
of their analysts and they therefore

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,000
they want to reduce the number of false

248
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
positives

249
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,480
we spoke to um these 14 professionals

250
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,320
and they confirmed that indeed um

251
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
network detection was the main use case

252
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,040
of uh threat intelligence for them

253
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
um but we heard also examples of other

254
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
uses

255
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
for example one organization used threat

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,760
intelligence to

257
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,480
understand the level of crime

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
in a third country because they were

259
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,650
considering doing

260
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
emergent acquisition there or

261
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,720
[Music]

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,079
another organization was using threat

263
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,399
reports to understand

264
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,360
the direction that development of their

265
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,640
mobile banking application should take

266
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,320
now in these conversations with um the

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
customers we listened uh and inductively

268
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
gathered

269
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
the

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,839
quality perceptions and the terms that

271
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,279
they use to describe threat intelligence

272
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,600
as being valuable

273
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,200
and we aggregated those into the

274
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,200
categories

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,959
actionability relevance and confidence

276
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:19,200
only one in five customers

277
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,599
said something about costs at all

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
so in conclusion we present the first

279
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,000
overview

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,560
of paid threat intelligence

281
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,320
we find almost no overlap um with paid

282
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,279
trade intelligence and open sources

283
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
suggesting it's really a different beast

284
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
but

285
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
we find also very limited overlap

286
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,160
between

287
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,519
two different threat intelligence

288
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,040
providers

289
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
even though they are both leading

290
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,920
providers

291
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
this raises some questions about the

292
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,839
coverage that these vendors are

293
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,199
providing

294
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
but actually the customers don't really

295
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,680
seem to mind um they're optimizing for

296
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
the workflow of

297
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,120
their analysts rather than maximizing

298
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,440
detection

299
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040
and really they have other use cases in

300
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
which for example the comprehensiveness

301
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,279
of a report

302
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
is much more important to them

303
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,839
last year at the ccc conference

304
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,000
[Music]

305
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,040
crowdstrike senior director

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,320
um spoke about aggregating threat data

307
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,360
and the role that commercial vendors

308
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
commercial trade interventors

309
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
potentially have in overcoming the data

310
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,000
sharing problem

311
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,120
this is very interesting and indeed

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,200
threat intelligence can be really

313
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,839
helpful for network defenders

314
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,279
but based on our findings we question

315
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
the coverage that these commercial

316
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,320
vendors are really providing

317
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,920
on the tread landscape as a whole

318
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,639
now the professionals don't seem to

319
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959
mind so much and returning to the story

320
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,160
about

321
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,518
three private investigators in absence

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,439
of

323
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,680
good information a customer is likely to

324
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,720
choose for

325
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,519
the most expensive option the ibm effect

326
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,920
and they do so because it signals

327
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
quality

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
but in a market with asymmetric

329
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,479
information

330
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,079
um the willingness to pay of consumers

331
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
might eventually go down because they

332
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,239
cannot distinguish the good from the bad

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
and this effect is known as the market

334
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,880
for lemons and we discussed this also

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
in the paper um i thank you for your

336
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
attention

337
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
i will take any questions in the q a

338
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:39,839
and i hope that you will read our paper

339
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:41,920
thank you

340
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
