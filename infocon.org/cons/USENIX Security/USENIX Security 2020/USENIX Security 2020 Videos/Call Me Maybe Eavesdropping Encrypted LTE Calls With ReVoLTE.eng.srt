00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
hi everyone and welcome to my talk

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,080
with the title call me maybe

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,360
eavesdropping encrypted lte calls with

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,279
revolter

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
am david duprecht and my co-authors are

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,520
kareena kohl's tostenholds and christina

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
pepper

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,680
over 250 operators use voiceover lte

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
worldwide and the voiceover lte is

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,759
thereby the defector standard for voice

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,320
calls in lte networks

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,840
using voiceover lte has many advantages

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
for providers

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,000
and users voice over lte have a low

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
core setup time a better voice quality

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,719
and with high definition voice

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,640
and for operators it's more efficient to

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
use faulty voice over lte in their

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,440
network

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,440
the question we are going to answer

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,599
today is are voice over

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
lte calls also more secure against

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,680
eavesdropping

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
to answer this question we need to

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,039
revisit some lte and voiceover lte

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
basics

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
so you got the phone on the left side

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,400
which is connected

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,679
via radio connection to the near space

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,479
station also called enodb and lte terms

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
and over this radio connections the

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,560
phone is connected

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
with an ip connection to the subsystem

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
called

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,680
ip multimedia subsystem the ip

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,040
multimedia subsystem also short

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
ims manages your phone calls it uses

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
normal ip

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
protocols like rtp and zip traffic to

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
signaling

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
your phone call and transport your voice

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,479
traffic

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,960
i said that that the phone has a normal

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,439
um radio connection

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,559
to the lte network to the base station

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,320
this is true

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,720
but there is also something special

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,360
about voiceover lve

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,200
so lte uses the concept of bearers to

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
ensure certain

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,799
quality requirements and this is

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,640
particularly important for

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,799
voice over lte so you can imagine that

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
a bearer is a tunnel with a certain

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,280
security

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,319
with a certain quality requirement and

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,319
when you got an ongoing voice over lte

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,958
calls you got basically three bearers

59
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,119
the first one is a normal default bearer

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,239
for the internet connection here

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,640
the second one is the ims bearer

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,560
which contains the zip messages directed

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,559
towards the ims

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,959
and the third bearer is very important

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,800
for us today this is the voice

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,000
and bearer which contains the rtp

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
traffic

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,640
and this bearer is only set up and

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
destroyed right after

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
the phone call today we are going to

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
look

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
into the security of this bearer

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,160
to encrypt traffic lte uses a stream

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
cipher

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
and which basically generates a key

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,160
stream block

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
that is then exported towards the plain

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,680
text block

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,239
and then which results in the cipher

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,159
text

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,400
this cipher text is sent over the air to

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,159
the base station

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
and as input parameters for the

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,359
encryption algorithm for example as

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,760
encounter mode

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
we basically have three five input

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,760
parameters

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,040
first of all there's a key this key

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,399
is the normal user traffic key used in

90
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
lte

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,959
second we got a count which is an

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
increasing sequence number for packets

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
sent over the air third which is very

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,599
important

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
we have it's a bare identity

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,440
this better identity depends on the use

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,839
bearer for example

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,799
for the internet bearer we use bearer

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
id1

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,959
for the ims bearer we use bearer id2 and

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,640
for the

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,879
voice bearer we use variety 3.

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
we got one bit that signals if this

104
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,239
packet is sent in uplink or downlink

105
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,359
direction

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,720
and last but not least we have the

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,840
length of the keystream block this

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,599
length does not have any influence um

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
on the key stream itself it just

110
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,079
determines the length

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
of the block which is important to note

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
is

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,159
that the same input parameters generate

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,840
the same

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,159
key stream because everything is

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
deterministic in here

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
and the same key stream can result in

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
the

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
in in keystream we use and as we all

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,240
know

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,240
keystream reuse is always a bad idea so

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
for example if you have two cipher text

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
here

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,639
and x or these two cipher text are

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,120
encrypted with the same key stream

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,400
and you xor them this would result in

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
the xor

128
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,560
of two plain text plain text r x or

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
plaintext b

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,080
under the assumption you know one

131
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
particular plaintext for example

132
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
plaintext b

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,080
here you can xor is and this would

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
result in the decryption of plain text

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,400
a so consequently

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,120
key stream reuse allows decryption under

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,479
the assumption you know one plain text

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,520
and this is something

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,440
we exploit photovoltaic because revolt

140
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,880
stands for reusing encrypted voice over

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,840
lte traffic to iftop's calls

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
so in which situation can a key stream

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
reuse or cure

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,239
during its voltage setup so basically we

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
got three input parameters

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,800
that are changed over time so the

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,880
direction is fixed and the length is

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,160
something we cannot influence

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,120
so first of all when is the key renewed

150
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,039
the key is renewed every time your phone

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
connects to the closest space station

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,280
so when you are got an active radio

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,960
connection

154
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,119
as long as this radio connection is

155
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,000
valid also the user plan key

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,160
is valid so when you receive now a call

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,080
your enude b instructs the phone to

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
reset the account for the bearer and

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,639
sets the barrier id of the subs or of

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
the

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,160
bearer and

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
the problematic case is when there is a

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
second call

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,360
which also in which also the enough b

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,080
instructs your phone

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,039
to reset the account and set the bar id

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,840
the question is

168
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,120
if this bearer id is the same as in the

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,599
first call

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,600
and or are they increased

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,080
so this is something we tested um

172
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,240
in total we tested 15 enough b's mainly

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,960
in germany but also in south korea

174
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
we tested a wide um geographical

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
distribution

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,240
which is important because providers to

177
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,520
tend to deploy their

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,840
um one vendor in one particular region

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,039
and we basically find two kind of

180
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
behaviors

181
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,520
the first behavior is that the enol b

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,880
increases the variety

183
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,919
three of the tested enough b's increase

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,000
the variety however

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,719
we also find 12 e-nut b's that do not

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,919
increase the variety which results in

187
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,199
reusing this game

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,840
same key stream for two kind

189
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,560
um for two subsequence calls in one

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,039
radio connection

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,039
so how does a revolt attack concept look

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,639
like so we have two parties

193
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
first of all we have alice on the left

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,759
side one on the right side

195
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,840
pop both perform a target first call

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,160
which we call target call

197
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,479
and during this target call the attacker

198
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
is already active and sniffs

199
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,318
the traffic which is over the air

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
transmitted from atlas to the base

201
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,639
station

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,560
and the aim of the revolted attack is

203
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,919
now to decrypt this first target call

204
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,759
so he sniffs it and immediately after

205
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,359
the phone call is finished which he can

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,479
detect on the radio

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,800
because the bearer is teared down the

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,560
attacker calls alice

209
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,960
and this call is particularly important

210
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
because it scanner allows us to generate

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,159
the key stream which is also used in the

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,000
first call

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,440
so we know the plain text which we sent

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
to alice

215
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,800
and we know the cipher text and both

216
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,280
allows us to determine the key stream

217
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
and then the key and this particular key

218
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,239
stream is also reused in the

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
first target coil

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
so we implemented all of this um in a

221
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,198
real world

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,840
set up in a commercial network using

223
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,240
airscope

224
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,080
as as downlink sniffer airscope

225
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,279
is a downlink sniffer based on the open

226
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,919
source stack for by sslte

227
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,320
and let me show you the video so we have

228
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,598
um

229
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,640
alice here and bob here here we see

230
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,560
asco the airscope sniffer and we got a

231
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,880
manuscript manuscript here

232
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,359
detecting the calls and recalling

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
everything

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,480
by jane austen volume one

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,479
chapter three mr woodhouse was fond of

236
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
society in his own way

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
he liked very much to have his friends

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,800
come and see him

239
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
and from various united cause is the

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,279
cattlemen were the anointed

241
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,080
they were the grandes of the grass kings

242
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,519
of the kind

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,279
lord of the lay barons of beef and bone

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
they might have ridden in golden

245
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,320
chariots had their tastes so inclined

246
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
the cattlemen

247
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,680
so we now will hear the decrypted and

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,440
called

249
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:39,920
phone call the first phone call

250
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
mr woodhouse was fond of society in his

251
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,319
own way

252
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,319
and very much to have his friends come

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,120
and see him and from various united

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
as you can see we successfully decrypted

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
um

256
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
the first phone call based on the key

257
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,200
stream

258
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,120
recovery of the second call and

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
why is this possible this is possible

260
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
because of the implementation flaw

261
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,920
by some vendors and i have to admit that

262
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
the specification in this case is not

263
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
really clear basically you've got two

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
kinds of specification

265
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,880
and there's a security specification

266
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,720
which

267
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
contains the security requirements and

268
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
there's a protocol specification

269
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,120
and only the security specification says

270
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,160
few sentences about the

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,320
risk of key stream reuse so

272
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,279
we responsibly disclosed this

273
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,640
vulnerability

274
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
via the gsma cvd program

275
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,880
and we achieved two kind of things

276
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,319
first of all um the specification now

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,200
includes test cases um that allow

278
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,880
um yeah to detect the revolved

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,640
vulnerability

280
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,040
and the 3gpp also clarified

281
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
the risk of the key stream reuse it's

282
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,000
now more clear to vendors

283
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,279
and programmers that key stream reuse

284
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,279
must be mitigated

285
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:05,439
in any case further

286
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,120
we find that

287
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,880
the vendors have patched the

288
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,279
vulnerability of revolter

289
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,120
and the affected providers have deployed

290
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,040
the patches

291
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,240
so having this said um

292
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,279
i mean we can only test a limited range

293
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,839
and so we don't know

294
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,680
um how many providers are actually

295
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,320
affected by this vulnerability

296
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,160
or even have heard about the patch yet

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920
thus we don't know how many

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,560
vulnerable enough b's are still out

299
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,120
there therefore we have developed an app

300
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,839
that allows you to test your local enode

301
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,399
b

302
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:47,519
on the revolting vulnerability you can

303
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
hear all instructions and informations

304
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,800
about the app

305
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,959
you can find on the web page vvvolta.net

306
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
and if your enude b is vulnerable you

307
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,479
can share the information

308
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,920
results and we will contact the

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,279
responsible provider

310
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,160
with the help of the gsma and to fix a

311
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,439
problem

312
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,719
in this way we ensure together that this

313
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,240
vulnerability

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,399
is patched and wiped out

315
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
this is how i would like to end my talk

316
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:25,839
thank you for listening and i'm happy to

317
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:25,839
take any questions

318
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
you
