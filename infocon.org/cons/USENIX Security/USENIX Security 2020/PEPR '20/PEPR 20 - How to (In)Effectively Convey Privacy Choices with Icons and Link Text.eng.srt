1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,200
hi

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,480
i'm florence help hi i'm laurie

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,400
and we're going to be talking today

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
about how to ineffectively combat

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,959
privacy choices

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,759
with icons and link text

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
so privacy policies we know are lengthy

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
full of jargon

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,720
they're very abstract so people tend not

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,679
to read them

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
and privacy choices unfortunately are

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,640
not much better

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,078
they are difficult to find they often

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
spread across services

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,480
with often inconsistent options so

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,440
consumers really struggle with finding

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
information about

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,360
privacy and data practices as well as

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,519
choices available to them

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
one direction that has been suggested is

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,520
that we could use icons

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,599
in general icons are great to guide

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
attention to hazards as well as

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,520
available options

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
they communicate concepts concisely they

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,640
can be language and culture independent

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,559
and they also help with recognition so

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
if we see an icon again in a different

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
context

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,840
it helps us understand what that

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,000
function behind the icon might be

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
for privacy icons there's hope that it

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
works similarly that we can draw

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
attentions to certain features

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
such as choices communicate privacy

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
concepts

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,679
and help consumers identify data

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
practices and privacy choices

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
more readily through visual

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
representations

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
and we're seeing in recent regulation

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
kind of an increasing

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
encouragement of icons so in the gdpr

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,399
there's a mention

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
of the possibility of using icons to

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
communicate data practices

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,479
similarly the ccpa mentions icons

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,880
for the do not sell opt-out however

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
the history of privacy icons is somewhat

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
checkered

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
and i'm going to show a couple of

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,479
examples and i don't mean to throw any

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
of these projects under the bus

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,799
what i want you to to get across is that

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
designing privacy icons is hard

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
so what you're seeing here are icons

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,759
that were proposed in 2011

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,759
by a team from mozilla i'm just going to

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
give you a second to see if you can

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,000
interpret each of these icons and what

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
they stand for

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
okay so maybe you've got that the first

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
one probably has to do something with

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
retention right like looks like a

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,760
calendar

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,239
three months was restored indefinitely

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,920
second one third party use

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
okay maybe if you know what it means it

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
might be clearer

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,560
the third one data shared with ad

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,399
networks it's not clear to me that a

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
megaphone is necessarily understood as

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
standing for

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
ad networks and the same for the last

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,879
one here's another example of privacy

76
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
icons there's a plugin

77
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,160
released by disconnect in 2014 and

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
basically when you would go to websites

79
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,959
or at least some websites it would show

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
these icons in different colors again

81
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519
give you

82
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
a short second to see if you can guess

83
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
these icons

84
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,080
okay and here are their meanings from

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,599
top to bottom from left to right

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,360
so the first one expected use it's

87
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,920
actually based on the mozilla icon

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
but then these four bubbles are expected

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,839
collection so are they actually other

90
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
parties collecting data on that website

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
the location icon okay that's maybe

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
familiar

93
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,440
the retention period again the calendar

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
leaf the little dancing person

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,800
has to do with children privacy and

96
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,519
whether copper is addressed

97
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,280
dnt okay that speaks for itself if you

98
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
still know what do not track is

99
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
the lock okay secure communication to

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
the server

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,319
that little heart is whether the site

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
was affected by the heartbleed ssl bug

103
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,399
and then is a trustee certified here's

104
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
another example of a privacy related

105
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
icon

106
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,519
do you know what it stands for it's the

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,480
daa ad choices icon you can click on it

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,440
to opt out of seeing targeted

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
advertising

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,959
however in a study that laurie and

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
colleagues conducted

112
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,920
when people were shown this icon what

113
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
they thought would happen when they

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,559
clicked on it

115
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,799
is that they would actually see more ads

116
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
or that they could buy ads on the page

117
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,720
or the couple thought okay maybe there

118
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
are updates for tailored apps but most

119
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
people

120
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
were quite confused by this icon and

121
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,680
there are many more

122
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,679
more examples of studies that have

123
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
focused on icons all of these are great

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
but we don't have the time today to talk

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
about them so what i want you to take

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
away from this

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,159
is that i can design for privacy can be

128
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,359
really really difficult

129
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
in particular when we're trying to

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,320
communicate complex and abstract data

131
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,320
practices

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,440
in a visual format what we're focusing

133
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,079
on today though

134
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
is how can we indicate the presence of a

135
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,639
privacy choice

136
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,800
through an icon and do that in a way

137
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
that is not confusing to people and

138
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
actually gets people to understand what

139
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
happens when they click

140
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
and to talk about this i'm handing it

141
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,719
now over to laurie

142
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
the california consumer privacy act or

143
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,280
ccpa

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,680
requires that websites place a link

145
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,119
that says do not sell my personal

146
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
information

147
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
optionally they can also include a

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
button

149
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,479
or a logo but the regulation doesn't

150
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,638
have any indication

151
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,520
as to what this button or logo should

152
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,520
look like

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,840
so we decided to help out the state of

154
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,639
california and try to come up with some

155
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
good designs

156
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
and evaluate them our icon development

157
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,960
and evaluation

158
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
was a seven step process we started by

159
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,159
coming up with lots of different ideas

160
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
for icons

161
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
we narrowed it down and we did a

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,960
preliminary icon evaluation

163
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,400
with users then we refined the most

164
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,719
promising icons

165
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,560
and we ran another test with users on

166
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
the refined icons

167
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,400
then we came up with a whole bunch of

168
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,400
different link texts

169
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,479
we ran another test with users on the

170
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
link text and then we took the most

171
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,758
promising

172
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,359
link text and the most promising icons

173
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,960
and we tested them together

174
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
in a combined evaluation so this is what

175
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,479
our

176
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,840
ideation step looked like we focused on

177
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,520
three concepts

178
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,758
we looked for ways to represent the

179
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,320
concepts of choice and consent

180
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
the concept of opting out and the

181
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,240
concept of

182
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
do not sell you can see we we involved a

183
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
number of our colleagues

184
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,039
in this process and we came up with lots

185
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,240
of

186
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,680
very rough sketches clustered them

187
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,600
and came up with a whole bunch of

188
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,639
different ideas we then

189
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
gave those ideas to some designers and

190
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,919
had them

191
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,600
refine the ideas so here are some of our

192
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,599
favorite ideas related to

193
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
choice and consent you can see we've

194
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
used check marks and

195
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,800
x's we also had some ideas related to

196
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,799
opting out

197
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
here we have the concept of taking

198
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
something out of

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
a box or taking something out of a hole

200
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,919
or a folder

201
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,400
we also refined a bunch of ideas related

202
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,599
to

203
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,159
do not sell you can see we used a dollar

204
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
sign

205
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,199
to represent selling we used a slash

206
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,719
and a stop sign and a do not enter sign

207
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,000
to represent do not sell and we also had

208
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
one that looked like an id

209
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,759
card to represent personal information

210
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,440
we also decided to test the digital

211
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
advertising alliance's

212
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
privacy rights icon which they put out

213
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,599
there and said could be used

214
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,000
for this purpose with the ccpa

215
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,800
we did our first icon evaluation we

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
recruited 240 participants on the

217
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,360
mechanical

218
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,240
crowdsourcing service we tested 12 icons

219
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
half of our participants saw those icons

220
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,599
with the phrase

221
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
do not sell my personal information and

222
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,400
half of them saw the icons

223
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,400
standing alone without that tagline

224
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
for each participant we showed them one

225
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
icon

226
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
and then we asked them what what they

227
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
thought the icon means and what would

228
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,400
happen

229
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,680
if you click on it then we displayed all

230
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,318
12 icons

231
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
and we asked them to tell us which one

232
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
they thought best conveyed

233
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,240
do not sell my personal information and

234
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
which one they thought best conveyed

235
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,639
privacy choices so the first thing we

236
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
saw from our results was that the icons

237
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
were really difficult to interpret

238
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,479
without words

239
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,000
but we saw that there were some

240
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,318
promising ideas here

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,919
when we asked which best conveys choices

242
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
about personal information

243
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,719
participants liked this stylized toggle

244
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,160
that had a check and an x

245
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,240
in something that looked sort of like a

246
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,160
toggle button when we asked them

247
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,759
which best conveys do not sell my

248
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
personal information

249
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,039
the one that participants most preferred

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,840
was the dollar

251
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,400
sign with the slash however they also

252
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,878
told us

253
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,560
that it tended to convey concepts like

254
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,759
payments as well

255
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
participants were mostly confused by our

256
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,479
opt

257
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,560
out icons they didn't understand what we

258
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,718
were trying to go for here with

259
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,679
removing something from the box or the

260
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,519
folder

261
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,439
and we found that most people didn't

262
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,839
recognize the stop sign

263
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
perhaps because it was black and not red

264
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,000
so we refined some of the most promising

265
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,519
icons we added color to them and made a

266
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
few other small changes

267
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
and we did another evaluation here you

268
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,599
can see

269
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,279
that that dollar sign with the slash was

270
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,080
the one that participants thought best

271
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
conveys

272
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
do not sell my personal information

273
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,720
again and once again

274
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,439
the toggle icon which we now colored

275
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,519
blue

276
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
best conveys choices about the use of

277
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,560
personal information

278
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,399
participants still didn't love the

279
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,000
dollar signs and the green

280
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,320
daa icon was still not well recognized

281
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,720
we dug down a little bit to see what

282
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,279
people thought these icons meant

283
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
when we didn't show them to tagline with

284
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,360
the blue toggle icon

285
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
a lot of people were able to recognize

286
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,040
that this had something to do with

287
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,519
accepting or declining something a

288
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,560
choice so that's what we wanted

289
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
with the slash dollar most people were

290
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
not understanding

291
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,360
what it was actually about they thought

292
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
it had something to do with something

293
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
being free

294
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,640
or requiring no money or cash not being

295
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,680
accepted

296
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
and the daa icon people thought it had

297
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,959
to do with

298
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,000
more information they saw that eye or

299
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,279
they focused on the

300
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,839
triangle and thought it was a button for

301
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,519
an audio or a video player so this

302
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,160
wasn't very successful

303
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,480
then we moved on to tagline ideation so

304
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,640
we started with the two taglines that

305
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,880
are in the ccpa regulation

306
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,800
do not sell my personal information and

307
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
do not sell my info

308
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,079
and then we came up with some variations

309
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,319
on those that were shorter

310
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,519
don't sell my info do not sell don't

311
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
sell

312
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
and then we added choices options and

313
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,040
opt-outs

314
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,040
and then we decided to try the word

315
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
privacy so privacy choices

316
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,120
privacy options privacy opt-outs and

317
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,519
then we decided to try

318
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,399
personal information or personal info to

319
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,399
be shorter

320
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,959
personal info choices options and

321
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
opt-outs and then finally we decided to

322
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
try

323
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,000
do not sell my info choices and do not

324
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
sell my info options

325
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,040
so we ran another mechanical turk test

326
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
this time with 540 participants

327
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
and what we found is the taglines that

328
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,959
had the word cell

329
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
in them were often misunderstood unless

330
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,920
it came

331
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
with the word personal information or

332
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,880
info

333
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,279
we found that do not sell my personal

334
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,480
information and do not sell my info

335
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,040
which were in the ccpa conveyed narrow

336
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
choice

337
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,519
effectively but they didn't convey more

338
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,519
general privacy choices

339
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,160
we found that options and choices were

340
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,800
more effective than the word opt outs

341
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,959
and so from all of these tag lines in

342
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
addition to the ccpa taglines the most

343
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,640
promising new tag

344
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,359
lines were privacy choices privacy

345
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
options

346
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
and personal info choices so then we

347
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,360
moved on to

348
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,720
our combination testing here we ran a

349
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
mechanical turk study

350
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
with over 1400 participants and we

351
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
tested

352
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
the three most promising icons along

353
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,040
with the five

354
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,839
most promising taglines as well as no

355
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,319
tagline

356
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,839
so there were a total of 23 combinations

357
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,399
that we tested

358
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
we did this test in the context of a

359
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,600
fictitious

360
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
shoe retailer which you can see here we

361
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,240
had this nice shoe store website

362
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,760
and then there were lots of links

363
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,560
typical of what you find at the bottom

364
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
of the website

365
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,638
and one of the links was do not sell my

366
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,079
personal information

367
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,320
with an icon each participant saw

368
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
one of these tag lines and one of these

369
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
icons

370
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,560
some participants saw a tagline only

371
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,839
without an icon

372
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,199
or an icon only without a tagline here

373
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
when we looked at

374
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,959
what participants thought these taglines

375
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,839
and icons meant

376
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,599
we still saw a lot of misconceptions

377
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
people who saw a personal info

378
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,760
choices thought that personal info

379
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
referred to things like shoe size

380
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,439
site settings payment methods because it

381
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,360
was a shoe store

382
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
people who saw the slash dollar icon

383
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,120
sometimes suggested

384
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,959
that it was related to payment options

385
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,120
and encrypted payments

386
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,119
and occasionally but not very often

387
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
people who saw the toggle icon

388
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,240
thought that it was a real toggle that

389
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,279
you could click on and toggle between

390
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
states

391
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,120
we found that without the tag lines none

392
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,279
of the icons were very good

393
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
and the slash dollar was particularly

394
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
bad

395
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
we also found that if we just gave

396
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,079
people the taglines

397
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,040
on their own the icons didn't actually

398
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,279
have much impact on their interpretation

399
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,399
however we think that the icons are

400
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
still useful

401
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
because they can help draw people's

402
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,760
attention to

403
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
the tagline so we made some

404
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,639
recommendations

405
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
to the california office of the attorney

406
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,480
general we recommended

407
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,040
that the best thing to do would be to

408
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,720
adopt this blue stylized toggle

409
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,560
icon with the phrase privacy options

410
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
this would allow consumers to look for

411
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,839
one button on a website for all of their

412
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,839
privacy options

413
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,839
they could find their do not sell

414
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
choices but they could find all of the

415
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,680
other privacy options there as well

416
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,079
and this would prevent the proliferation

417
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,359
of buttons on the bottom of websites

418
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,120
however since the ccpa actually requires

419
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,760
the phrase do not sell my personal

420
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,160
information that would also be an option

421
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,279
and that would comply with the ccpa as

422
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,279
written

423
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,320
once again here is the icon that we

424
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,160
recommended

425
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
and actually a few days after we

426
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
submitted our report to the california

427
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
office of the attorney general

428
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,439
they came out with their revised

429
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,199
proposed regulations

430
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,360
and they included this red toggle icon

431
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,519
and you can see it's kind of similar to

432
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,040
what we proposed but it's red

433
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,639
and it looks a bit more like an actual

434
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
toggle switch that you might find

435
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
for example on an iphone we thought that

436
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,279
this had the potential

437
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,439
to confuse people who might be even more

438
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,160
likely to think that they could actually

439
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
click on it and toggle with it and a lot

440
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,920
of other people

441
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,120
had the same speculation that we did

442
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
there were a lot of messages

443
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
on twitter with people who were fairly

444
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,120
critical of

445
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,920
this new proposed red toggle icon some

446
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
of these people

447
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
are actually pretty well known in the

448
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,959
security and privacy community

449
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,680
so we ran another study this time we

450
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,560
tested

451
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
our blue stylized toggle with the

452
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,880
california

453
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,000
red toggle we also thought well this

454
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,720
uh x in the in the red toggle

455
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
is a little small and unbalanced so

456
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,279
let's try a version that has

457
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
a bigger x as well and let's see if

458
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,079
color makes a difference

459
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
so we also tried a red version of our

460
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,800
icon

461
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,199
and blue versions of the california

462
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,639
icons so what did we find

463
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,479
well first of all we found that there

464
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,639
was insignificant differences between

465
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
the icons with the big x and the small x

466
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,040
so

467
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,480
that made basically no difference but

468
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,279
there was a big difference

469
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
between the california icon and our

470
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,880
stylized toggle

471
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,719
the california icon was much more likely

472
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,079
to be misinterpreted

473
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,519
as an actual toggle color turned out not

474
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,199
to make very much difference

475
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,600
there were only small differences based

476
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,680
on color so from this we learned

477
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
that some small changes can sometimes

478
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
make a big difference

479
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,320
and you won't really know unless you

480
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,199
test with users

481
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,759
in this case we think the check and the

482
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,240
x

483
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,120
and the slash line made it clearer to

484
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
users

485
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,680
that this wasn't a real toggle but it

486
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,320
still suggested the concept of toggle

487
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
whereas the california icon looked too

488
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,519
close

489
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,360
to an actual toggle but we had to run

490
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
the study to really know that that was

491
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
the case

492
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,399
a few days after we submitted our

493
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,360
recommendations to the office of the

494
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,360
attorney general

495
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,560
they came out with their final

496
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
regulations

497
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
in which they completely removed the opt

498
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,399
out button

499
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,880
from the regulation they said they will

500
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,399
design a uniform and recognizable opt

501
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
out button and test it

502
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,600
in the future but that hasn't happened

503
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,680
yet so

504
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,440
in the meantime we recommend that

505
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,920
websites go ahead and adopt

506
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,240
our blue stylized toggle now to help

507
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,920
direct consumers to privacy choices

508
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,000
all in one place thanks laurie

509
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,279
now let's talk about what we should take

510
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,440
away from this

511
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,040
so here's kind of our testing privacy

512
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
indicators 101.

513
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,719
i think the important takeaway should

514
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,440
really be that you should always involve

515
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,399
people and consumers from the start we

516
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
as experts

517
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,240
are the worst judges in terms of what

518
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,160
other people understand

519
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,120
when you show them an icon and then

520
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,199
there are different things you might

521
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,799
want to test what we specifically focus

522
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,640
on in our study is comprehension

523
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,799
so what does this icon mean how is it

524
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,160
interpreted an expectation

525
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,839
what do people think happens if you

526
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,039
click an icon however there are a couple

527
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,958
of other things that also need to be

528
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,240
tested before releasing icons in the

529
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,160
wild one is

530
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,599
is this icon actually noticeable does it

531
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,760
draw people's attention

532
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,359
also discoverability where an icon is

533
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,359
placed makes a big difference whether

534
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,959
people can find it and if they find it

535
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,559
can they recognize it and say like oh

536
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,160
that's this other icon i saw in a

537
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,160
different context

538
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
when we implement icons and choices we

539
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
also need to look for utility

540
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,440
is the choice behind the icon actually

541
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
useful to people and then

542
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,799
we also should track people's behavior

543
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
and see whether they click on the icon

544
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
the different ways how we can test so

545
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,720
what we did here is basically a b

546
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,480
testing or between subjects testing we

547
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,480
conducted online studies with different

548
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
conditions where one person saw one

549
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,679
particular

550
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,439
treatment one particular icon design

551
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
that allowed us to see differences

552
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
between

553
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,840
these different icons we can do this

554
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,879
with online studies as we did it's it's

555
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,120
relatively fast

556
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
it's also relatively inexpensive and

557
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,120
they're platforms that specialize

558
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
on remote user testing you can of course

559
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,239
also create your own panel or recruit

560
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,840
users in any other way

561
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,200
just think about what's easiest for you

562
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
and makes the most sense in terms of

563
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,360
your product

564
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
in addition to online studies you also

565
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,520
want to test in context create mock-ups

566
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,719
or prototypes or actually test in real

567
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
production systems

568
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,320
to see how a specific icon or privacy

569
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
choice

570
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,678
works and context in which it will

571
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
eventually be seen by consumers

572
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
so that takes us to the end of our talk

573
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
and the takeaways

574
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,960
for you should really be icon design is

575
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
hard but it's not impossible

576
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,480
the important thing is that you involve

577
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,320
users from the beginning and do

578
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,559
user testing user testing user testing

579
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,039
user testing before you put anything out

580
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,639
there

581
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,160
what we found in our studies is that

582
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
privacy choice icons

583
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,520
work best when they were rooted in

584
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,760
simple and familiar concept conveying

585
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,720
choice was actually much much easier

586
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,879
than conveying privacy specifically if

587
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,559
you combine the icon with the link text

588
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
this can be a powerful combination to

589
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,440
get people to correctly interpret the

590
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,799
icon

591
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
at the same time just because an icon

592
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,720
has been used many many times

593
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,760
doesn't mean it's a good icon design

594
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,480
just changing

595
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,080
the ad choices i can color from blue to

596
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,320
green and now calling this

597
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,760
do not sell icon doesn't seem like a

598
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
great idea according to our study

599
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
findings

600
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,760
it's also important to recognize that

601
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,919
privacy indicators or these icons are

602
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,600
only one part of usable privacy choices

603
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,200
what comes after once you click

604
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
whether people understand the form that

605
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,919
comes then and the options that are

606
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,360
available

607
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,799
to them is also something that needs to

608
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,000
be studied and then what we're

609
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,240
advocating for is also

610
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
for standardizing privacy indicators

611
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,320
doesn't seem like a very scalable

612
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,799
approach to have every law and every

613
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,280
regulation require its own icon

614
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,639
something like our privacy options icon

615
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,120
and then aggregating

616
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,919
all privacy related choices under that

617
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
particular

618
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,679
link would be much more useful to

619
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,480
consumers in the long run if you want to

620
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
learn more about usable and useful

621
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,919
privacy interface design

622
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,360
lori and i wrote a chapter on this

623
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,640
particular topic

624
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,479
in the recently released iapp book

625
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,480
feel feel free to check that out thank

626
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
you
