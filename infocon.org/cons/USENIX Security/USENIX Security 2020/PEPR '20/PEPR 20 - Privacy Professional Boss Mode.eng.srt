00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
hi everyone

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm melanie ensign founder and ceo of

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
discernible

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,560
discernible is a specialized

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
communications consultancy dedicated

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,840
specifically to

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
security and privacy organizations

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880
previously i led

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,640
security privacy and engineering

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,640
communication at uber

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
my goal today is to help you expand your

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
role as a privacy practitioner beyond

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,759
compliance

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
build the influence you need to get

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,920
things done inside your organization

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
and reduce your reliance on regulatory

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,960
hammers to get things done

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
because my long-term goal is to create a

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
legion of ambitious

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
no privacy professionals who

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,919
can masterfully navigate the halls of

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
business to bring

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,199
greater respect for human impact and

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
consequences

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,559
to the companies and organizations that

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,960
we work for

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
or perhaps we'll create new ones and

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
grow even more

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,199
influence you see if we're influential

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,239
as individual professionals we can

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
collectively

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
elevate the practice of privacy to

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,679
become more influential

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,360
over business to get started

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
let's spend just a few minutes thinking

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,439
about what your current role is

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
think about what you are hired for

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,279
versus what you actually

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,200
do versus what you would like to do that

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,240
you're not yet doing

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,119
no matter where you are in your career

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
the next phase will require you to think

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
creatively

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,720
about your individual role as well as

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,759
the role of the privacy function

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
which likely includes other people keep

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,200
in mind that

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
whether you have a leadership title or

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,360
not

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
you can have impact on others and the

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,040
organizations around you

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
but you must consciously choose to

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,439
exercise your abilities

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
skills and knowledge to make a

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,158
difference

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,680
and to do this you will need influence

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
you need to be able

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
to get people to care pay attention and

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
take action

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
on what you say remember that people

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,280
will do things for their own reasons

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,080
not necessarily yours so to be effective

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,080
you need to know how to motivate them

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
now one of the things i've observed over

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
the years working with privacy

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
professionals from all different kinds

67
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
of disciplines

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
organizations and backgrounds is that

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
relying on regulatory hammers to

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,079
influence others

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
inside your organization actually has

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
diminishing returns

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,399
you might be able to temporarily spin up

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,239
certain people or teams with a looming

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,720
regulatory deadline

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
but once the deadline is passed so is

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
your influence

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
and in some cases compliance isn't even

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
enough to motivate teams

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,599
that don't share in the consequences of

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,239
non-compliance

82
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,518
again people do things for their own

83
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,120
reasons

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
this isn't to mean that laws and

85
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,440
regulations in general

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
can't have profound and lasting impact

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,640
on an industry over time

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,079
they certainly can the context i'm

89
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,958
talking about here

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
is the ability to motivate other people

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
or

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,159
other teams within your organization to

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,799
care about privacy and invest in your

94
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,799
program

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,560
even when big brother isn't breathing

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,760
down their necks

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,959
in fact real influence for privacy lies

98
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,359
in moving organizations from compliance

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,159
to commitment i hear privacy

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
professionals

101
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
all the time talk about various

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
departments or

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
clients asking for the bare minimum

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,480
requirements

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,560
or holding resentment against compliance

106
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,480
mandates and privacy teams

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
for pulling resources from other

108
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
projects

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
or for being a perpetual buzz kill i've

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
seen

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
product and engineering roadmaps get

112
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,200
completely derailed

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,480
anywhere from six to 18 months by urgent

114
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,359
yet usually vague compliance needs and

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,119
trust me

116
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,959
that pisses off everyone advancement

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
in these particular organizations

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,920
usually depends on shipping new

119
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,518
and innovative projects if you're only

120
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,238
engaging with them

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
on internal compliance needs you could

122
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,239
be holding back their career goals

123
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
and they will be less keen to help you

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
again

125
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
instead approaching privacy requirements

126
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,599
from the perspective of

127
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,680
creative or innovative problem solving

128
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,440
gives other cross-functional partners

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
something exciting to include in a

130
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,719
performance review

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,000
or to a calibration committee for

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
promotion

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
remember people do things for their own

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
reasons so to get what you want for your

135
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
privacy role

136
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,639
and program you must be able to deliver

137
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,599
the kind of opportunities other people

138
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
need

139
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
the truth is no one can fake enthusiasm

140
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
for privacy forever

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,638
even when faced with regulatory mandates

142
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,280
and eventually they will tire of the

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
facade

144
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,919
and slip into bad behavior and your role

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,320
is now that of the babysitter

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,159
which doesn't elevate you or the

147
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,039
function of privacy

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
but even more importantly cultures of

149
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,520
compliance

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,160
seldom if ever take initiative

151
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,440
they're not very creative and rarely

152
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,759
think outside the box

153
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
if you want to step into the next phase

154
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,360
of your career

155
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,039
you will need innovative and creative

156
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,280
programs to get there

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,880
you cannot afford to settle for a

158
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,039
compliance mindset

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,240
or to let your organization settle for

160
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
one either

161
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
privacy must become more than compliance

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
for everyone involved

163
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,960
and you must be the one driving that

164
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,680
culture

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,239
if you don't you will find engineers

166
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
rotating off of privacy projects

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
to get away from compliance work in

168
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,120
order to contribute to something they

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,759
find more interesting or exciting

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
if privacy isn't yet considered one of

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,639
the most

172
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
interesting technical challenges for

173
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
engineers

174
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,359
at your organization you will be

175
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,479
swimming upstream

176
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,240
a lot in terms of securing financial and

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,318
engineering resources

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,319
cooperation from partners and

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
recognition from senior management

180
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
so how do you know whether or not you

181
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
already have influence

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
here are a few questions to help you

183
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,000
determine whether or not you do

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,880
if you don't you need to start building

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
it

186
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,719
if you already have some influence then

187
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,880
your next step is to grow and exert it

188
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
productively in order to achieve your

189
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
goals

190
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
now a few things to know as we move into

191
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,160
the next section of our discussion

192
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
getting to the table isn't the same as

193
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,600
having a voice

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
at the table our goal here is to give

195
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
you

196
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
and by extension the privacy function of

197
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,639
voice

198
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
in the decision making process so we

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
actually need both an

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,080
invite to the table and the opportunity

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
for you to speak

202
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
that distinction is important when

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,639
determining your current level of

204
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,198
influence also keep in mind that

205
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
building

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,479
influence typically works its way up one

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,039
level

208
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
at a time sometimes you can start at the

209
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,960
top depending on

210
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,359
your position and existing relationships

211
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,680
but it's also important to recognize

212
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
when

213
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
peer relationships can help you build

214
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
influence with

215
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
other leaders outside of your reporting

216
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
chain

217
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,479
and the next thing to keep in mind is

218
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,880
that you want to be at the right

219
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,840
table based on the decisions and people

220
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,120
you want to

221
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
influence here are a few questions to

222
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
consider for

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,639
identifying the tables you need to be at

224
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,120
and where you might be able to exert

225
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,759
influence based on your goals

226
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,039
if you've ever taken a negotiation or

227
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,440
conflict

228
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,800
mediation training you might recognize

229
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,160
some similar themes

230
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
that's because you can never get

231
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,199
something for nothing compromised

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
shared outcomes and collaboration are

233
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,879
the name of the game

234
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,639
an important note here in regards to

235
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,639
internal politics

236
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,080
is that the higher up you go in an

237
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
organization

238
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
the more competition and the more voices

239
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,080
there are

240
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,080
in order for you to punch through you

241
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,318
will have to constantly deliver

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,599
maximum value as a strategic advisor

243
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,960
so what exactly does a strategic advisor

244
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,960
in privacy do

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,878
first you must be relentless about

246
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
demonstrating

247
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,879
business value even when revenue

248
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,319
isn't an option for your privacy program

249
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,640
look at profits

250
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
and the bottom line are you able to

251
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
decrease the cost of demonstrating

252
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
compliance

253
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,039
or the time required to secure new

254
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,480
business deals

255
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,720
privacy teams should think about

256
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,839
conducting their own market research

257
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
to study external reports dig into brand

258
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
perception

259
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,479
gather stakeholder feedback from

260
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,560
external facing teams like

261
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,600
your customer support organization

262
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,479
business development public policy etc

263
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
and find out where subpar privacy

264
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
practices

265
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
are creating friction for your business

266
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,839
so that

267
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,320
you as a privacy team can help fix it

268
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,320
this is yet another great opportunity to

269
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,640
collaborate with other teams for

270
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,279
maximum and reportable impact

271
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,319
a deep understanding of tooling is also

272
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
critical for building

273
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
influence for privacy because it's the

274
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
starting point for

275
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,160
internal and external audits as well as

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,480
customer assessments

277
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,560
once you understand what tooling is

278
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
already being used by your internal

279
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,000
stakeholders

280
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,160
you can explore whether privacy benefits

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
could be gained by borrowing those same

282
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,199
tools

283
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,920
for example some infosec tools can also

284
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,320
be used as privacy controls

285
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,319
some site reliability tools can be very

286
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
helpful in measuring performance and

287
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,959
impact of new privacy infrastructure

288
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,000
such as decreases in downtime or latency

289
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,640
it's an opportunity to engage

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,959
teams where they already are learn about

291
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,920
their values and processes

292
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,920
what they consider to be success while

293
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,640
potentially reducing costs and

294
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,399
developing well-rounded

295
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,560
cross-functional results this

296
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,200
exponentially increases the scope

297
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,160
and impact of your privacy program and

298
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
the results

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,760
you'll have available to report to

300
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,319
business leaders

301
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
improving data quality and reducing

302
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
complexity

303
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
are universal peace offerings for

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
cross-functional teams

305
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,800
so don't overlook these opportunities

306
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,519
for privacy to collaborate

307
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,920
on these goals or better yet lead them

308
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
now a lot of emphasis is put on writing

309
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,160
within the privacy industry especially

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,079
in technical and legal disciplines but

311
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,000
verbal skills are even more important

312
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,120
when it comes to exerting influence in

313
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
real time

314
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,959
over other teams you need to be able to

315
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,160
articulate your

316
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,959
long-term vision in the language of each

317
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,600
stakeholder and be prepared to

318
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,319
demonstrate

319
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
progress on that vision within 12 months

320
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,640
to gain confidence

321
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,519
from other teams and be ready to show

322
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,720
and communicate continuous improvement

323
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,160
throughout the life cycle

324
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,240
of your program risk acceptance

325
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,199
should expire at some point and be

326
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,839
evaluated

327
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
again things can change quickly or

328
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
drastically

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,560
and the risk tolerance of your

330
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,439
organization your regulators and your

331
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
customers

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,200
evolves over time if you're persuaded to

333
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,800
accept privacy risk for any reason

334
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,040
give it an expiration date with the

335
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,000
appropriate team and set a reminder to

336
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,319
revisit that decision in the future

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
and finally when the business makes a

338
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
decision

339
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,319
against your guidance as a privacy

340
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600
professional

341
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,480
document it if hits the fan

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
receipts are helpful for accountability

343
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
and

344
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
in diagnosing underlying issues this

345
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
doesn't need to be an

346
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
angry or resentful endeavor that is not

347
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
what i'm suggesting

348
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,279
at all keep it factual and

349
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,760
focused on the risks and opportunities

350
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:14,079
that you advise to the team

351
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,319
so let's say hypothetically you're

352
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,638
already at the table that you need to be

353
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
at

354
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,800
to create the privacy role and function

355
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,959
that you want

356
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,800
how do you use your voice effectively

357
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,199
here are a few tips for giving

358
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,040
influential advice

359
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,279
make sure you fully understand the

360
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,439
situation and perspective of the person

361
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,760
asking for your help

362
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
follow up with deliverables or materials

363
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
you recommend to help inform their

364
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,040
decision

365
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,079
i see a lot of practitioners missing

366
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
opportunities to

367
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,160
influence by only sharing opinions

368
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,719
during scheduled meetings but

369
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,719
not doing post-media work to ensure that

370
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
decision makers have everything that

371
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,240
they need

372
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
keep in mind that advisors are often

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,720
expected to give useful advice

374
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
on the spot especially with senior

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
leadership

376
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,638
so be sure you can deliver refined

377
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,920
concentrated ideas and information

378
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,720
directly and concisely to power up those

379
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,719
relationships

380
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,599
and finally a few notes on advising

381
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,680
senior leaders

382
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,279
both within or outside your own

383
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,439
reporting chain

384
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,560
remember the goal here is to be called

385
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
in early

386
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,359
and asked to stay longer because that's

387
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
how you shape the scope and direction of

388
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,120
your role

389
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,800
and the privacy function i recommend

390
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,320
delivering three doable

391
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,000
options have these in your back pocket

392
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,560
that is the mark of an expert advisor

393
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,160
one of those options can be to do

394
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,920
nothing

395
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
but you should talk about that first

396
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
before any of the lawyers do

397
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,920
because discussions that start with

398
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,800
legal arguments for doing nothing

399
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,399
often stop there but your best

400
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
recommendation from a privacy

401
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,720
perspective may

402
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,480
actually be something else like

403
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,880
doing something more doing something

404
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
more

405
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
means going above and beyond bare

406
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,479
minimum

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,800
requirements which is something we often

408
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,959
discuss as privacy professionals

409
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
how can we elevate the practice as a

410
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,599
business opportunity

411
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,440
or brand differentiator the answer

412
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
is by doing something more

413
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,519
thank you so much for your time today i

414
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:42,959
look forward to discussing your

415
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:42,959
questions in the live q a
