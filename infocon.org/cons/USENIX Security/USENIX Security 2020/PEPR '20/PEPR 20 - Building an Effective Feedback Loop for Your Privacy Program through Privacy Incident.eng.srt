1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,960
hope you all are staying safe and

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,080
healthy during the pandemic

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,640
i am shree a privacy engineer working in

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,119
the privacy incident response space

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
and today i'm going to be talking about

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,198
building an effective feedback

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,679
loop for your privacy program through

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,160
privacy ir

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,199
the nature provides many examples of

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,000
feedback loads

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,160
and i'd like to pick the snowball effect

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
if you roll a small snowball

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,519
down a snow-covered hill it just gets

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
bigger as it

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
rolls and more like magnification

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,199
there are two ways of looking at it in

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,839
the context of instant response

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,199
now if you're seeing privacy incidents

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,079
of a certain type

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
affecting a certain tenet of privacy and

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
if there is

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
no feedback loop established to learn

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
from these incidents

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
and if there are no preventative

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,320
measures being developed

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
the chances are the issue becomes a huge

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,759
snowball

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,280
the other way of looking at it is the

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
more trends you observe

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
and the more analysis you perform on

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
these incidents the privacy design

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
processes

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,720
just become stronger over time now let's

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,920
begin

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,799
with discussing the important

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,799
aspects of building a privacy program

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
so the foundation for any strong privacy

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
program

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,360
is undoubtedly its privacy policies

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,240
now having transparent clear and concise

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
privacy policies makes it comprehensible

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,199
for the users

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,200
and also helps in building user trust

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
additionally with the growing number of

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
privacy laws

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
they just mandate privacy policies which

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,640
outline the privacy practices

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,119
of an organization now the next block

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
here

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,200
is risk assessment and compliance

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,920
risk assessments can help organizations

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,319
understand

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,479
what personal data they process how the

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,879
data flows between the systems

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,400
the inherent weaknesses and threats to

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,319
the privacy landscape

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
and of course the compliance with all

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,799
the applicable privacy laws regulations

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,080
and best practices

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,560
the next block is privacy by design and

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,920
it's essentially baking in privacy at

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
different stages

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
of the system or software development

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
life cycle

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,959
through privacy engineering privacy

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
enhancing technologies

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
taking into consideration the privacy

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,560
risks which have emerged from

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,200
the risk assessment process now having

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
set up

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,040
the right foundation and building

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
privacy focus systems

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
or products it is essential to test

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
these processes

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,160
and have an effective way of responding

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
to incidents

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,319
and this involves creating incident

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,519
response frameworks

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,839
roles policies

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,840
books tools and best practices

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,518
next up we're gonna be discussing more

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
about privacy

84
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,280
incident response and why it is actually

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,359
challenging

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
regardless of the scale of the

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
organization

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,440
with security incident response the risk

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
is particularly around

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,120
unauthorized access and disclosure of

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
data

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
unauthorized modification and the

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
availability

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,280
of information mainly revolving around

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,720
the cia trial

96
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
over the years there have been

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,760
significant advancements in

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,920
the tools and techniques for detection

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,399
threat hunting capabilities and in

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,359
general

101
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
the ir processes have just become mature

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
as well

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
in the security space in the case of

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,959
privacy incident response

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
they come in i think the incidents come

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,760
in different flavors

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
um and like processing user data without

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,959
explicit content

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,959
or over sharing of pii or not adhering

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,640
to the retention guidelines

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
or not adjusting the data relation um

112
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
not honoring the data deletion requests

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,039
of users

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,839
so in in a nutshell there are there's

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
still a lot of

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,198
unknowns and the whole privacy ir

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,239
process

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,040
is evolving and

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
as new privacy regulations emerge in

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
united states and

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
across the world the burden on

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,479
organizations to actually comply

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,840
with these breach notification

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,960
obligations is

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,039
increasing and as we all know the

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
non-compliance with the notification

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
timelines are taken very seriously by

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
the regulators

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,719
and heavy fines are imposed

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
um next up is privacy budget and

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
resources now

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,120
organizations have already spent a lot

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,159
of money

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,520
uh investing in gdpr programs

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
the risk assessments um external audits

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
tools

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,160
the privacy workforce and many more so

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,520
the chances of

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,240
actually having a dedicated um

140
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,680
set of budget and resources for privacy

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
incident response

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
is pretty slim although the concern for

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,960
privacy still remains high

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,240
incident response involves

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,880
cross-functional efforts from

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,320
multiple teams it could be privacy

147
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
engineers it could be software

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,199
developers

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the legal team and and some long tail

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,560
privacy

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
incident pieces require these multiple

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,080
teams to

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,080
come together and develop or enhance the

154
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,359
existing work

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,359
and the existing architecture and and

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
it's really challenging for incident

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
responding

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,919
incident response teams to keep this

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,639
momentum going

160
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,639
for all these mitigation efforts

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,318
and now let's talk about the feedback

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,599
loop so going through this loop as we

163
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
discussed earlier

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,479
um we perform privacy risk assessment

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
and then we identify the

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
um the weaknesses the the

167
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
vulnerabilities the

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
the privacy risk and then we feed them

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
into

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
the system or the product development

171
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
life cycle

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
and then we adopt a privacy focused

173
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
approach

174
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,000
we use privacy enhancing technologies

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
where applicable

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,199
we leverage the best practices of

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,479
privacy engineering

178
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
we go through rigorous reviews and

179
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,318
testing

180
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,440
prior to releasing products and then as

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
part of the continuous

182
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,280
evaluation of the privacy state of the

183
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
organization we conduct privacy

184
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,679
impacting

185
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,400
assessments privacy audits and vendor

186
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,360
privacy

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,239
vendor um or like third party um

188
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
assessments

189
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,479
while while all this is happening in

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,680
parallel incidents are reported

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,520
and depending upon the incident response

192
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
model

193
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,719
these can be reported externally by

194
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,479
researchers

195
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,199
or customers or users or internally by

196
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,080
the employees

197
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,560
and then the incident response life

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,599
cycle

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,840
kicks in um the issue is uh

200
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,479
contained to mitigate the damage and

201
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,719
then short-term fixes are made

202
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,599
and if there is a legal obligation to

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
notify

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,240
um the impacting uh the the impacted

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,359
customers of users

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,680
um are then um notified

207
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,599
uh so basically comms is sent out adding

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,080
to the notification timelines

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,719
now finally after dowsing the fire that

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
comes

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,080
um from these incidents the important

212
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,400
piece of

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,878
of the process is the analysis

214
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
now essentially analyzing the root cause

215
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,400
of

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,599
the incident and what led to the failure

217
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,198
of compliance

218
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,159
and the ir team and the engineering

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
together uh they put together they they

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
put together

221
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
a postmodern um documenting the

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
preventive

223
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
the preventative measures or the

224
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,280
additional investigations to be

225
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
performed

226
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,960
and now this is just one incident

227
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,360
so if we want to see the big picture

228
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,280
um not if we want to see like it is

229
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,800
important to see the big picture

230
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,679
and identify the incident trends and

231
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,799
glean into the actionable insights

232
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,359
so if we observe an incident trend or

233
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
if we spot a privacy bug or a flaw in

234
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,919
the system

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,040
we don't want to operate in a vacuum

236
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,439
so now that we have identified the areas

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
for

238
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,680
improvement we want to share this with

239
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,399
the product with the risk and compliance

240
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,399
teams

241
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,720
and leadership of course and and as

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,640
always leadership is interested to learn

243
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,120
what's breaking what progress have been

244
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
made and and this in turn can be used to

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
justify the need for

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,240
additional resources and

247
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
incident responders are always on the

248
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,920
front line

249
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
and when your products and services are

250
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,199
running with minimal outages

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
not enough credit is actually given to

252
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
the ir team so these metrics

253
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
actually demonstrate the effectiveness

254
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
of an ir program

255
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,079
and all the efforts that have been spun

256
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,439
up as a result

257
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,200
of the incident analysis and the last

258
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
piece here about why metrics actually

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
matter

260
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,760
is incident prevention and and i think

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that is the most trickiest of all

262
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,959
and it's pretty illusive as well because

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,200
there is no

264
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
silver bullet to actually put an end to

265
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,839
incidents um

266
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,519
or to just fit in that puzzle magically

267
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
so we just try to minimize the

268
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,360
occurrence of the

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,760
observed trends over time

270
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,720
so what are some things to consider

271
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,680
while working

272
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,240
on privacy instant metrics so as with

273
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,439
any metrics data quality is important

274
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
and especially when decisions are being

275
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
made

276
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
based on them the one aspect which feeds

277
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,560
into data quality

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
is the consist the consistency in

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,518
tracking metrics

280
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
now depending upon the organization

281
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,959
structure and the operating procedures

282
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,959
there can be one or more

283
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,680
privacy teams or they can be a combined

284
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,760
security and privacy ir function

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,160
now irrespective of this the incident

286
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,200
metrics need to be tracked consistently

287
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,880
to have better data for instance um

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
if we are missing some metadata for a

289
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,279
certain class of incidents

290
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,680
the data as a whole might not actually

291
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,800
be as effective as it should be

292
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,599
now metrics don't always paint the

293
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,880
exact picture or define the health of a

294
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
privacy program

295
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,360
simply because it's it's not complete

296
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
incident response is just

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
one piece of the puzzle and we could do

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,959
many more things like for instance we

299
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
could do privacy threat modeling we

300
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,279
could do red teaming exercises

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
or we could just build a privacy event

302
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,439
management system

303
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,079
um very similar to the same the security

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
sim to

305
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:10,719
automate um pretty much detect and alert

306
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,880
privacy incidents now there can be

307
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,160
a lot of parties or stakeholders which

308
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,040
can be interested

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,439
in incident data but we want to make

310
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,000
sure

311
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
that we put this data in the right hands

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,680
um

313
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,239
and right hands as in the folks who can

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,680
who can actually leverage this data and

315
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,880
act upon it

316
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,640
moving on to the final piece which is

317
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,880
what metrics actually matter so

318
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,240
i want to start by saying that this list

319
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,959
can be extensive

320
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,320
and can vary for every organization

321
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,719
depending upon

322
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,720
um just the maturity of the privacy

323
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
program and what actually matters to

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
the leadership as well um i have

325
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
captured a few

326
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,199
uh which i thought would be applicable

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,120
to most organizations and um

328
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
so first off the incident source how

329
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,399
many of them have been reported

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,560
externally um i mean by

331
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,399
users of customers and how many of them

332
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
have been reported internally by

333
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480
um by employees and and what are the

334
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
root causes of these

335
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
incidents and what chunk of these

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
incidents

337
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
um are caused due to third parties and

338
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,240
this can actually be

339
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
used to analyze what risks uh third

340
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,680
parties

341
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,279
pose to your privacy program and then

342
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,719
are we seeing a certain

343
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,279
or a steady spike or drop in incidents

344
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,240
and is it because of better privacy

345
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,839
controls

346
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320
and practices or is it just less

347
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,920
reporting

348
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,440
what trends are we observing across

349
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,719
services or products or based on

350
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,959
a particular category of privacy

351
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
and which of which category of privacy

352
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,518
actually needs more focus for instance

353
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,160
do we need to focus

354
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,680
more on our logging capabilities or

355
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
retention and deletion

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,880
or consent and so on and how many of

357
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,519
these incidents are high severity or

358
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,680
low severity and how many users are

359
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,959
typically impacted due to

360
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,160
the due to the incidents and

361
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,880
how many of these are just bugs um

362
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,399
versus events versus incidents versus

363
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
actual breaches

364
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,160
and what portion of these incidents

365
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,200
actually rose to the level

366
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,240
of notifying users and yeah

367
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,600
so there could be so many more metrics

368
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,720
that can actually be tracked

369
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,399
but ultimately it all boils down to uh

370
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,639
how we can tie all these together and

371
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,199
consistently improve the privacy state

372
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,320
of the organization

373
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:49,839
with that i would like to take q a

374
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,839
thank you

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,079
you
