1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,719
my name is

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,120
sergeant shopkin and i would like to

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,599
welcome you to this using security panel

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,480
on

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,680
digital contact racing digital contact

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
tracing

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,480
has been recently proposed and also

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,000
deployed as means to contact race

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,720
people in in this coffin 19 epidemic

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
meaning it is it is a mechanism through

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,960
which

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,559
contacts of about 15 minutes within two

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,840
meters distance

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,760
could be detected between between people

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,399
in in order to inform

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,000
informed use people that they have been

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,200
exposed to kovit 19

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,480
in case that one of their close contacts

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,719
was uh was tested positive for kovid

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,599
for kovi 19. so this is a

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
in a nutshell what contact tracing is is

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,879
suppose

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
supposed to be doing manual contact

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,679
racing already does this

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,320
by by essentially asking infected people

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
to list

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,080
their recent contacts digital contact

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
tracing would

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
make this process less labor intensive

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,520
and also would

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
would enable the detection of those

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,880
contacts that normally would not be

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,920
captured by

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,360
manual contact racing such as those

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
those happening at in public transports

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
and

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,400
in public places digital contact racing

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
notably will

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
leverage existing devices such as

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
smartphones or bracelets and also

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
existing technologies such as gps and

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,520
bluetooth in order to

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,960
speed up its deployment and

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,600
and use there were a number of

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,199
proposals for digital contact racing the

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
community has been extremely active in

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
this

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
in this space however it would take a

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,680
long time to

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
to describe all of them instead i'm only

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
only going to

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,798
mention exposure notification framework

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,280
by apple and google which has been

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
already deployed in android and ios

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,840
operating systems

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,920
and also deployed in in a range of

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,000
european countries

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,238
that you can see on the on the list on

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,360
the right

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,840
this exposure notification framework is

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,800
uh on a on the surface extremely simple

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,200
it relies on

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
bluetooth low energy advertisement

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,160
beacons

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,160
that are exchanged among between the

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,760
phones in order to

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,519
to enable both proximity detection

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,079
and also to to enable the discovery of

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
and and later on reporting of of

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
infections

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,720
the the main idea was already discussed

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
in the community

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
uh through various community projects

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,720
such as dp3t

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,599
in order to discuss digital contact

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,560
tracing

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,280
we assembled a great list of panelists

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
um

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
starting with moti young from google one

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,359

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,920
exposure notification framework

computer scientist

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,518

university of washington

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,560
in order to start this this panel

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
and to start the discussion i asked

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
panelists to answer

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,760
the following questions so each panelist

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,080
will answer one of these questions

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,000
questions are related to discrimination

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,879
tracking stigmatization

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,040
should we be deploying contact tracing

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,518
given the risks of such things happening

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
to

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
to the users especially since this

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
system is envisioned to be

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,358
deployed on a large scale among millions

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,880
of of users

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,599
in each country about the usefulness of

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,919
digital

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,440
contact tracing compared to manual

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
contact racing and also

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,919
in general how useful is his contact

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,720
tracing

118
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,799
do we want to rely or should we rely or

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
do we have to rely on google and apple

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,560
to deploy

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,400
content parts of contact tracing for us

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,880
this is a question mainly

123
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
aimed at multi as a representative of

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
google

125
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
can can we even make contact tracing

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,159
secure and private

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,199
do are there any inherent limitations

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,880
that would make

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,560
these systems so insecure and or

130
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,600
or so privacy violating that we

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,199
do we wouldn't want to deploy them uh

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,840
this is a question that goes initially

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
to stefano and finally a question for

134
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
carmilla

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,479
what did we learn from current

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,198
deployments we have contact tracing now

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,359
deployed

138
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
in several countries are there any

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,800
success stories any failures

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,039
uh how do we move on for the

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
for the rest of the attendees please use

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
slack to raise

143
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
questions for the panelists and um we

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
will not be able to cover

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,239
all of these all of these questions that

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,720
you raise but please keep the discussion

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,240
going on on slack

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
and now to the um to the uh answers from

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
the

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
from the panelists is digital contract

151
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
tracing useful

152
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
in general and compared to manual

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
contract tracing

154
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
let me recap some of the basic ideas

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,160
behind this type of intervention

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
we know that infected individuals are

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
contagious one to three days

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
before they develop symptoms so if we

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,199
limit ourselves to

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,199
isolating uh symptomatic individuals

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
we are one step behind of the virus

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
however the opportunity of

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,919
counter-tracing both manual and digital

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,520
is to use information sources that we

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,799
might have available and collect extra

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,280
data to identify

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
contacts of known cases and ask this

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,400
contact to solve quarantine

169
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
and in this case we have the opportunity

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
to get

171
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,400
ahead of the virus the the basic science

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,880
of

173
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,440
digital contact tracing in general of

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,840
fast contact racing was worked out

175
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,000
in this science paper by luca ferretti

176
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,599
christopher fraser and collaborators

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
where they study the interplay of two

178
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
non-pharmaceutical intervention

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,799
the isolation of symptomatic cases this

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
is what you see

181
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,479
in the x-axis here and the quarantining

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,638
of their

183
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,599
contacts and what we learned from this

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
study is that

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,479
if you have a high enough success rate

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,599
in isolating cases i mean identifying

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
and quarantining

188
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
their contacts then you end up in the

189
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,840
top right region

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,360
of the diagram where you have a negative

191
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
amplification rate for the for the

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,880
epidemic and you can

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,400
and you can contain it this is based on

194
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,319
on a model the model has

195
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
a number of assumptions but this is a

196
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,639
strong indication that this strategy

197
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,039
might be viable and and motivated

198
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,479
a lot of the contact racing uh apps that

199
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,680
we are seeing

200
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,280
today today uh key points about digital

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,080
contract tracing are that

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,400
it is not meant to replace uh manual

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,719
contact tracing manual contact tracing

204
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,239
has access to all sorts of additional

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
information and context which is

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
relevant to

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,799
reliably identify contacts for digital

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
counter tracing

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,840
we use a physical proxy for example a

210
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,799
close range proximity as detected by by

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,878
bluetooth

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
and of course this comes with very

213
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,080
limited context so it's it's important

214
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
to understand that

215
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,960
these two strategies have to dovetail uh

216
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
together but digital contract tracing is

217
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,560
useful in the

218
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:02,560
in that it allows uh uh scale

219
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:07,280
and it allows speed we we only have

220
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,960
a few days time window to to react

221
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,799
as far as the tactic contacts are

222
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,878
concerned and so being able to

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
give back a digital platform is a is a

224
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,879
potentially huge uh

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
advantage and of course uh the

226
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
scalability comes

227
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,240
with uh with a relatively low low cost

228
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,960
from this type of interventions

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
now moving ahead it's uh it's important

230
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,560
to study

231
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,759
um how digital contract tracing and

232
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
manual contract tracing

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
work in simulation on top of real data

234
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,519
from human contact

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
and there are on there is ongoing work

236
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,240
right now on using high resolution

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,240
proximity data collected by proximity

238
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,440
sensors as you see here in the left

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,959
from the sociopatterns project all by

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,519
using smartphones

241
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,839
and bluetooth-based proximity this is

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,320
the copenhagen network study

243
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,959
by maison aleman these data allow us to

244
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
simulate uh how these type of

245
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
interventions

246
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
uh work together and to understand some

247
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,839
pretty complex interplays

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,160
between them and if you want to read

249
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,040
more about them here you can find a few

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
references

251
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
thank you

252
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,439
hi everyone my name is carly kind and

253
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
i'm the director of the ada lovelace

254
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,839
institute

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
and we're a research institute with a

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
remit to ensure that data and ai work

257
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,480
for people in society in

258
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,519
april of this year we undertook a rapid

259
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,519
evidence review

260
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
just prior to the first generation of

261
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,680
digital contact tracing apps being

262
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
rolled out

263
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,479
in europe and we asked the question is

264
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,959
there enough evidence to support the

265
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
rollout of digital contact tracing apps

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
and at that time we found the answer to

267
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,279
be no and

268
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,119
to be frank that situation hasn't

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,240
changed dramatically that is in the

270
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
intervening months

271
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
we haven't seen the evidence to support

272
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
the

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
investment in digital contact tracing

274
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
apps that we're seeing across western

275
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
europe and

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,560
in the us and that relates to a number

277
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
of different factors

278
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,479
there is of course the technical

279
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
considerations does the bluetooth

280
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
technology

281
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,120
work adequately to detect

282
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,479
proximity between mobile phones and

283
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
there is still

284
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
a number of questions about how

285
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
effective bluetooth is

286
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,040
at doing that accurately there are also

287
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
questions around the behavioral aspects

288
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,839
of using

289
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,519
digital contact tracing apps we don't

290
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,959
yet know whether

291
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
people strictly abide by notifications

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
given to them

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,600
by contact tracing apps we don't yet

294
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,319
know whether they're more or less likely

295
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
to

296
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,920
leave their phone at home when they

297
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
start to get notifications

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,959
and we haven't explored yet how things

299
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
like

300
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,040
the financial impact of self-isolating

301
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,800
as a result of

302
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,640
a notification from a digital contact

303
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,359
tracing up um

304
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,880
affects people's behavior and whether

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
people from particular demographics are

306
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,279
more likely to comply than others

307
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,399
and we also haven't yet understood how

308
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,399
the very real

309
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,680
problem of digital exclusion and not

310
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,360
enough people having access to

311
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,599
smartphones

312
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
interplays with digital contact tracing

313
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,560
technology

314
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,800
in particular given that covid

315
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,119
particularly disproportionately impacts

316
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,719
people of old age for example or for

317
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
particular communities who might be less

318
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,120
likely

319
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
to have access to a smartphone so

320
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
there's lots of unknowns

321
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
still we haven't seen the evidence from

322
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
any country currently deploying digital

323
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,560
contact tracing apps

324
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,800
that they've been a decisive factor in

325
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,839
an effective pandemic response

326
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,760
indeed in places like australia digital

327
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
contact tracing up there which has

328
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,040
quite a considerable percentage of

329
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,040
uptake amongst population

330
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,719
hasn't led to the identification of any

331
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
new contacts that weren't otherwise

332
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
discovered through manual contact

333
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
tracing

334
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
and we've had evidence from places like

335
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,160
iceland that the

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
digital contact tracing out there was

337
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,120
not a decisive factor in their response

338
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,719
so at this stage it doesn't feel like

339
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
there is the evidence to support

340
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
it's considerable investment in contact

341
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,680
tracing apps although the situation is

342
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,839
of course complicated we should be

343
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,439
exploring multiple options but

344
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,240
it's certainly not a clear-cut issue

345
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,120
a very important question is to which

346
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,839
extent

347
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
bluetooth-based exposure notification

348
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,959
can be made secure and private

349
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,638
and this question is actually very

350
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,000
tricky

351
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,000
to start with a certain loss of privacy

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
is already inherent in the exposure

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
notification functionality

354
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,760
no matter how securely it is actually

355
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
implemented

356
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,079
for example if i am alerted about an

357
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,279
exposure and i only met

358
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,160
a single person over the last few days

359
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,040
i can reliably be anonymize one user in

360
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
the system

361
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
who has been infected this is clearly

362
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
unavoidable

363
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
but even beyond this it is very

364
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,360
difficult to define

365
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,120
what best possible security and privacy

366
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
even means in this context

367
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
and this is also due to the diversity of

368
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,439
trust assumptions that are made

369
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
in this context which all come with

370
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,880
their own attack vectors and

371
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,079
threat models but what we do know is

372
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,519
that

373
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,399
also simple decentralized exposure

374
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,200
notification protocols like the one by

375
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,839
google and apple fail to achieve

376
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
whatever

377
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,240
best possible security and privacy means

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,760
they do guarantee a very high degree of

379
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
security and privacy but they

380
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,079
are subject to certain attacks uh these

381
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
attacks are either

382
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
against the security of the protocol

383
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,399
typically relay and replay attacks but

384
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,319
also against

385
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,399
privacy and in particular they affect

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
the privacy potential of the potentially

387
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,320
of those users

388
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,519
that report as positive for whom

389
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,720
previously broadcast

390
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,279
identifiers can to a certain extent be

391
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
linked

392
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,079
together so this has actually led to the

393
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,079
development of several protocols we show

394
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,599
that actually we can do better in terms

395
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,800
of security and privacy

396
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
but it has been generally been very hard

397
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,519
to

398
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,359
deploy ideas from these protocols at

399
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,160
scale and this is almost always due to a

400
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
combination

401
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
of recurring uh policy and technical

402
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
constraints

403
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
in the deployment of exposure

404
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,920
notification

405
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,360
so the bottom line is that the google

406
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,760
and apple protocol

407
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
is already deployed is the most widely

408
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,639
adopted one and it's really likely here

409
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,319
to stay

410
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,079
and so the the real question which i

411
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,160
hope we are going to discuss uh

412
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,279
in the in the panel later on is to which

413
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,839
extent

414
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,560
existing privacy and the security

415
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,839
weaknesses

416
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,839
are an actual problem in uh practice

417
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,560
a key learning for me is that what we do

418
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
on a paper design and implement the

419
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,279
protocol

420
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,040
is really the easy part the hard

421
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,639
problems came when we had to integrate

422
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,120
this protocol into an app

423
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,279
and a very complex health system we had

424
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,760
to design many other components

425
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,920
such as new authorization schemes new

426
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,880
tools to protect the privacy of network

427
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,800
traffic

428
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,800
new ways of logging information in

429
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,639
different cloud components so that

430
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,639
privacy could not be breached

431
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,480
and accountable hours of research in

432
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,560
bluetooth to make it a proximity

433
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,720
detection technology

434
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,319
we also learned that if one decides to

435
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,959
do an app that means that

436
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,320
one marries the platform and that means

437
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,800
that google and apple

438
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
have the right to decide what can be

439
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,240
done

440
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,000
who can do it and when can it be done as

441
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,120
they release different versions of the

442
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
api

443
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,040
and that hints that privacy is actually

444
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,839
the easy part to ensure from a

445
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,480
technical perspective but governance is

446
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,680
very hardcore

447
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,079
we also discovered that even of

448
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
those caveats implemented the system is

449
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,920
really the easy part

450
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,000
engagement is the real challenge how to

451
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
make users who fear surveillance and

452
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
governance and health authorities that

453
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,000
like the expertise to understand how

454
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,160
they can use the app and the benefits

455
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
took a lot of time and effort in the

456
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,959
communications

457
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
and at the very end does it really work

458
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,040
so

459
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,800
so far we have been running this for

460
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,439
very little time and the privacy

461
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,599
measures

462
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
uh avoid that we can collect a lot of

463
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
data but for switzerland i can tell

464
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,880
you that from the 2 million downloads

465
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,800
that we have 1.2 million users have the

466
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,519
app running that's a 15

467
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
of the adult population and we also know

468
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,959
that

469
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,240
9 of the positive pcr tests that are

470
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,560
done in the country

471
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,519
ask for a code and upload their data to

472
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,359
the system

473
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,480
each of these codes on average triggers

474
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,480
0.8 calls to the system and that seems

475
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,720
little but we know that many other users

476
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,040
that are notified actually go

477
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
directly to take a test or call their

478
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
family doctors

479
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,479
and we cannot count those users so

480
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
overall we think that

481
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
the app is actually triggering a

482
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,320
notification and is helping

483
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
preventing the spread of the epidemic

484
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,800
okay very good so i i would ask all the

485
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
panelists now to turn on their cameras

486
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
and moti

487
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,600
i think the floor is yours so the last

488
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,000
question that

489
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,880
i asked the panelists related to the uh

490
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,760
google and apple

491
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
exposure notification framework and and

492
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,240
how

493
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
how does this play into this whole story

494
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,559
so should we

495
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,400
trust or rely on on such frameworks

496
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:24,160
or do we even have a choice so monty

497
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,520
yes so i over the years i think

498
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,240
more than 30 years i

499
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
i had many

500
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,840
opportunities to move to academia but i

501
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,600
chose to stay in industry and

502
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,720
and the reason uh being mainly that

503
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,080
you can in industry you work into i can

504
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,919
work in two modes i can be

505
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,199
completely theoretical and develop new

506
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,200
cryptosystems

507
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,640
on the other hand i can look at actual

508
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
real world

509
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,960
problems and start solving them

510
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,840
and work on this so when we look at real

511
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,840
world

512
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:07,039
problems the maxim of the

513
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,840
the fact that actually it's a maxim but

514
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,280
it's a fact that

515
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,720
the best is the enemy of the good

516
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,678
hordes you have in real life

517
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,480
to make hard decisions what do you what

518
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,000
do you

519
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,160
what do you do given the set of

520
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,640
constraints

521
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
and

522
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,240
and this came up uh in march i started

523
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,240
to look at it i read the

524
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,360
the cdc and what what people doing

525
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,400
in epidemic

526
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,719
and and pandemic situation

527
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
and what you can do on the other hand as

528
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,520
a technology

529
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
you have to look what are the tools that

530
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,400
you have now

531
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,399
that were not there in 1918 in the in

532
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,280
the previous pandemic

533
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,120
and you do and you don't hope you don't

534
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,760
hope to solve things in a very

535
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,639
theoretical way that you have a theorem

536
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,720
blah blah blah

537
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,320
it has all the nice property qed and

538
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
then you cannot do anything with it you

539
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,280
have to compromise you have to take all

540
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,199
the dimensions of utility

541
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:19,039
security and privacy and

542
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,720
users and many many aspects into account

543
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,320
and i started to circulate potential

544
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
technologies in the company and this

545
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,159
came out and of course ble i was on a

546
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,400
previous project the

547
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,120
the ediston beacon so i was familiar

548
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,520
with the

549
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,760
technology and proximity and

550
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,480
i was thinking about the decentralized

551
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,520
approach from the beginning because

552
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,559
if given the pandemic we give us

553
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,000
we give our privacy for this then the

554
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
next step is

555
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
for something else and the third step

556
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,600
will be for something else and

557
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and you know privacy is a property that

558
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,719
you

559
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,760
you you can give up but you cannot

560
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,840
regain

561
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,559
at many places so so

562
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,559
uh i don't yet i don't yet answer the

563
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,440
initial question whether

564
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,440
we have to rely on apple and google i

565
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,720
just want to say that

566
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,720
it became an effort of many many

567
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,799
engineers and other people in technology

568
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,840
and in related areas in the two

569
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,080
companies

570
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:35,840
with the simple goal to do something

571
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,840
that is useful in our

572
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,039
did i freeze more new world of

573
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,439
smartphones before we didn't have smart

574
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
in the process advanced compute spam

575
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,240
advanced notion this would be

576
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,080
a statement advance a notion of compute

577
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,679
as much as possible

578
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,280
with the least possible information

579
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,360
thank you so thank you

580
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
thank you moti and we'll circle back on

581
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,879
the on the issue of

582
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,799
governance so essentially you know if we

583
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
would have free hands how do we

584
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,960
how would these contact racing systems

585
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,799
be be governed so thank you stefano for

586
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
raising raising this this issue but i

587
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,440
want i want to start by

588
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
by addressing some of the first uh

589
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,679
statements of the

590
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,360
of the panelists so i'll ask carmella

591
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,360
the following question so it seems that

592
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,439
carly is somewhat unconvinced that

593
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
digital contact racing is somehow worth

594
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
the risk

595
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,120
and and also the cost and you

596
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,719
you see benefit so can you can you maybe

597
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,639
comment on carly's statement and then

598
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,080
i'll ask harley later on to respond as

599
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,000
well

600
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,678
first i'll say that i think that carly's

601
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
a spot on right

602
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,440
we're spending a lot of money and a lot

603
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,080
of effort on actually doing this

604
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,559
uh but the question to to me when i came

605
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,799
to this world of contact racing which

606
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,158
uh many people that nominated was not my

607
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,320
particular passion

608
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
was that there was no option about we're

609
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,879
going to have an app or not we were

610
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,559
going to have an app

611
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,440
and then at that point it was very

612
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,320
important to minimize the risk

613
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,159
that what this app could do uh

614
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,200
afterwards right as this model was

615
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,080
was saying it was very important to

616
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
avoid that this app could become an

617
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,199
infrastructure that could be used for

618
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
further things

619
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,080
than discontext tracing and that was

620
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,640
most of the push that we did and so far

621
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,559
um i have to say as well as being

622
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,159
involved in one of these developments

623
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,840
that answering the question that

624
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,960
appeared on the slack many times

625
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,080
do we have proof do we have evidence uh

626
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
we have been running this team for a

627
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,480
month

628
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,240
um so there is not much data and also we

629
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
have to say that we did a very good job

630
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,039
at this privacy thing

631
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,280
that means that there is very little

632
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,360
data and very very few places in the

633
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,960
system which we can actually tap in fact

634
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,439
there is a lot of the system we cannot

635
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,280
see

636
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,760
we don't see how many notifications are

637
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
responded as i said in my videos some

638
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,640
people

639
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,480
do follow orders and call the hotline

640
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
some go directly to the test service and

641
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
then we cannot observe all of these

642
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,158
things

643
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,000
but what we see so far is that

644
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,200
notifications are being sent and people

645
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,679
are being tested and to me if even if we

646
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,520
just

647
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,200
you know save 10 chains of infection

648
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,760
given the exponential growth of

649
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,120
this disease we're already saving lives

650
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
so we will see

651
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,439
what are the things and and i totally

652
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,400
agree that we don't have evidence yet

653
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,280
but my takeaway from this is that since

654
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,679
it seems that

655
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,360
having an app was a must because

656
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
governments were going to put it

657
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,600
what we have right now may be one of the

658
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,158
best options

659
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,840
so maybe maybe to expand to give more

660
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,159
more information here so

661
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,320
some governments reported costs to

662
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,120
develop this and run this up

663
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
between few millions to tens of millions

664
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,559
and

665
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,039
so maybe now now the question to carly

666
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,678
so

667
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,360
do you think that sort of this cost is

668
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,159
is your concern or is it

669
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120
or is it some risks to vulnerable

670
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,440
populations or populations in general

671
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,239
uh that it that bothers you so much or

672
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,960
do you absolutely see no utility in this

673
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,919
or maybe i miss your statement yeah yeah

674
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,600
no that's useful

675
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,840
no i mean i i should say i start from

676
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,678
the point which is if technology

677
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,279
can help the pandemic response we should

678
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,279
use it absolutely

679
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,880
i i think the concern around contact

680
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,120
tracing

681
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,720
is one around process and it's a it's

682
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,799
broader than just this app it's

683
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,320
how should governments deploy and use

684
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,080
technology in which circumstances and

685
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,678
what process should they follow

686
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,279
and i think when governments deploy

687
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,000
technology it's different from google

688
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
developing

689
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,039
a piece of tech i you know multi spoke

690
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,799
about how

691
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,320
you need to talk think about utility and

692
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,840
you think about compromise and i think

693
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,840
that makes a lot of sense from a

694
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,120
from a company's perspective that's how

695
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,480
you develop a product

696
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,239
from the perspective of a government

697
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,960
they have other obligations including

698
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
making sure that

699
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,000
everybody is accounted for particularly

700
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
the most vulnerable and those

701
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,760
vulnerable to discrimination and other

702
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
problems and so a different process has

703
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,360
to be followed that's not

704
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,039
about what works for the majority but

705
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,639
about what works for everyone

706
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,480
and how do we make sure protections are

707
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
in place and nobody gets left behind

708
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,600
et cetera et cetera so i think when it

709
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
comes to government technology

710
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,760
development you're trying to marry

711
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,279
what has traditionally been a very agile

712
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,320
process that's about moving fast and

713
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
breaking things

714
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,240
and then what has has to be by necessity

715
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,159
a kind of slow

716
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,679
democratic process that's about bringing

717
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,200
people on board making sure there's

718
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,159
evidence making sure there's oversight

719
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
and review

720
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,640
and i think that's just a really

721
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,080
difficult thing to marry we're trying to

722
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,240
do it in a pandemic

723
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,199
and so that's the perspective from which

724
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,080
i raise concerns

725
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,440
not from a kind of neo-luddite

726
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
perspective that we shouldn't use tech

727
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,039
in this pandemic to

728
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,799
to help when so i think then when on

729
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,640
your question around cost benefit so in

730
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,520
the uk they spent around

731
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,360
well apparently reportedly they spent

732
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,918
around 12 million pounds on the first

733
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
generation of the app which has now been

734
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,960
binned and the second generation of the

735
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,158
app has been launched today which is

736
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,400
based on the google apple

737
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,840
api um is that is that worth it i think

738
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,159
it's a really difficult question to

739
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,240
answer because it also involves knowing

740
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,679
what resources went in that direction

741
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
that could have gone in other directions

742
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,480
and what were those other directions so

743
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,158
in the uk for example

744
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
we haven't had widespread testing

745
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,600
available until recent weeks

746
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,120
and you know months into the pandemic

747
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,279
you weren't able to get a test

748
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,959
so what was the trade-offs made there in

749
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,440
terms of investment from public health

750
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,840
did

751
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,440
more go into the app than went into uh

752
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,279
testing and i think

753
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,279
like i could go on and on about these

754
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,799
types of questions about what risk

755
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,360
assessment has been done how do we think

756
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,960
about

757
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,639
the fact that the majority people who

758
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,760
are vulnerable to covert are over the

759
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,120
age of 60

760
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,200
those are the same people who don't use

761
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,959
smartphones how do we make sure

762
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
that this type of system really accounts

763
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,360
for those who are most vulnerable to

764
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
this disease

765
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,399
there's a range of different questions

766
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,000
that need to get asked and my concern is

767
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,760
what is the process that's in place to

768
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,159
make sure those questions get asked

769
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,360
okay i want to follow up on what you on

770
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
what you just said and then we can

771
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,678
circle back to the technical risks uh

772
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,918
with

773
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,200
with stefano i i want to connect this to

774
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,919
the question of governance

775
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,760
so i mean this is anyone in on the on

776
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,240
the panel whoever wants to answer this

777
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
so

778
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,880
what would be the an ideal process so a

779
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,919
number of countries were complaining

780
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
about

781
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,360
uh google and apple sort of role in this

782
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,919
in this whole ecosystem and also

783
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,158
constraining certain functionalities of

784
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,919
how this how this application can be can

785
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,559
can be run for those of you that don't

786
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,640
know

787
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,158
how beacons can be can be recorded

788
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,640
directly by the by the app

789
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
and also transmitted directly by uh from

790
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,760
the app

791
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,360
so this was a main kind of point of

792
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,080
contention and restricted

793
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,520
essentially how the apps can be can be

794
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,279
uh constructed

795
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,158
so um how how can this be resolved so it

796
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,440
seems that

797
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,360
you know some governments were happy

798
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,240
with this some governments were not

799
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,639
so how can one govern such a such a

800
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
system

801
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,760
i'm not an expert on government and

802
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,919
running governments and i hope never to

803
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,919
be

804
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:07,439
but but public health is important

805
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,879
this thing has for example the exposure

806
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,440
notification

807
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,559
never meant to be the full solution so

808
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
let's take the

809
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,120
social welfare or social warrior

810
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,559
or social uh whatever

811
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,600
aspects of it if

812
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,678
if you know that you have a certain

813
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,320
portion of the city

814
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,960
that has rich people with smartphones

815
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,918
and

816
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,480
poor portions of the city then you can

817
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,399
redirect your resources for manual

818
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,399
contact tracing to the poor

819
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,799
population rather than spreading it all

820
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,520
over because you can rely

821
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,559
on the exposure notification in the

822
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,000
reach area

823
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,200
so this is how apps like this can help

824
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,640
the government

825
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,320
balance resources and actually help

826
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,720
the poor the the the the

827
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,000
the the thing that people expressed so

828
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,880
much worry about

829
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,039
them suffering actually because there

830
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,640
are complement uh processes and

831
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,080
and resources that can be by by

832
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,360
solid governance uh be distributed in in

833
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,520
in an imbalanced but fair way so that it

834
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,360
can help even the social aspects

835
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,559
let me let me let me maybe even even

836
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,678
make the question a little bit more

837
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,200
technical so what

838
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
what should be the functionality that

839
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,480
should that should run in an app versus

840
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,439
an operating system

841
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,240
in such a in such a constellation right

842
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,399
given the

843
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,000
given the sensitivity of information

844
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,439
given the the control that the

845
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,279
governments want and so on

846
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,520
but feel free to yeah

847
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,480
so i think that you ask the governance

848
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,760
not government

849
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,440
governance is about who has the right

850
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,919
to decide when the app starts when the

851
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,039
app ends and what the app does

852
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,640
and this uh marriage that we have now

853
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,799
with google and apple

854
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
um which hopefully it's a convenience

855
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,039
marriage and so far it's working

856
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,559
but it's also one in which the balance

857
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,760
of power in this sense

858
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,320
may not be hyper balanced because uh

859
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,919
what when is available is actually

860
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
something that we have some dependence

861
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,399
on

862
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
and that is something that has not been

863
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,840
discussed or or has

864
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,840
actually been imposed and there is a big

865
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
question about what is the future of

866
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,520
this

867
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,640
right how what to which point even if if

868
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,879
there are

869
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,480
systems the ones that run the app that

870
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,559
is still a strong dependence

871
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
as i was saying in my talk that i i am

872
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,799
very curious to see how

873
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,640
this develops in the future the second

874
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,120
thing that that goes with with currency

875
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,600
statement about how do we make sure

876
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,520
that these apps actually affect that has

877
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,840
to go with the government and

878
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,799
what else needs to be deployed together

879
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,199
with the app

880
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,480
um in the case of switzerland i'm going

881
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,919
to speak a lot about switzerland because

882
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,760
it's what i know about

883
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,520
uh there were laws that were deployed

884
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,679
together with the app to make sure that

885
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,360
the economical impact was not so big

886
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,360
so when you get a notification from the

887
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,399
app it's the same thing as being

888
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,879
uh as having a sick leave people get

889
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,719
the same kind of unemployment benefits

890
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,559
which in other countries that don't have

891
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,159
the same social benefits and the us is a

892
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,320
great example for this

893
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,840
uh this may actually be a big issue

894
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,200
because even in the case

895
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,720
uh where we're we have as kelly was

896
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,679
saying like the case

897
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
where poor places are more affected when

898
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,240
you put the app

899
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,080
inside even if they have phones that

900
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,919
means that because of what we want to do

901
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,279
with the app which is the speed

902
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
we're going to have more notifications

903
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,000
this means that you're going to send

904
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,518
more people home right this is

905
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,720
one of the main warriors of every

906
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,440
government how are they going to do the

907
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
support

908
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,720
and how do we create such a such a good

909
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,799
social economical environment for these

910
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,480
apps is something that is very hard

911
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,639
and and i'm not sure i would like to

912
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,360
know are we doing enough is it enough

913
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,600
with

914
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,039
kind of the things that we have put in

915
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,719
place in switzerland what else needs to

916
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,559
be done and especially what else needs

917
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,720
to be done in other type of societies

918
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,480
that maybe don't have the same uh nice

919
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,480
benefits as we enjoy here

920
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,240
do we have other panelists that want to

921
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,120
address this

922
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,880
this topic i i wanted to just uh add

923
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,799
something to this topic very briefly

924
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,519
when we discuss here about

925
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,440
um the the role of apple and google i

926
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,440
think one non-obvious point

927
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,360
that that hasn't come up yet is that

928
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,559
apple and google also define the

929
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,158
the interface needed to to work on top

930
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,600
of their apis

931
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,440
and there's a certain uh there's a

932
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,719
similar cost uh to to be able to

933
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
interact with them and the level of

934
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,320
granularity was decided by by them and i

935
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,640
think it has been

936
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,918
a little bit of a problem in some cases

937
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,519
and this might affect some also the

938
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,519
issues that kali has been addressing for

939
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,600
example in the us

940
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,519
many of you are in the u.s and as you

941
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,279
notice the adoption of these apps is at

942
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,120
a very different stage than it is in

943
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,720
europe and i think there there's an

944
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,239
issue of granularity that

945
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,960
the decision was to talk with states and

946
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,240
not all states are at the same level of

947
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,080
uh evolution in

948
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,679
technological terms or at the same stage

949
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,279
of fighting kovid

950
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,799
and what i've seen when i just for

951
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,919
context i worked before on an app

952
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,600
developed at the university of

953
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
washington that was before independent

954
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
of the

955
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,120
the apple and google apis and what we

956
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,678
have seen when this app came public is

957
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,279
that

958
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,960
most of the efforts to deploy contact

959
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,960
racing were coming from the bottom

960
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,200
so universities in particular we were

961
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,880
swamped by universities and also local

962
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,320
jurisdictions that wanted to adopt

963
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,120
contact racing and there was no way to

964
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,200
do that

965
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,479
within the existing framework because

966
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,080
they will have to adopt something which

967
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,240
is outside of the

968
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,240
google apple api framework and so it's

969
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,559
let's integrate it much less with phones

970
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
and

971
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,918
uh and then that that has been a problem

972
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,000
right so i think it's important to

973
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,760
decide at which level you want

974
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,519
to push for adoption and it's not always

975
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,960
the same so europe may function well at

976
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,640
the national level that was obviously

977
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,880
not the case in the us

978
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,880
and that's another barrier that comes up

979
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,000
let me just add let me just add

980
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,360
something that

981
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,640
in the us adoption is uh slow

982
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,959
virginia is the first state to to have

983
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,000
it

984
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,640
run and launched but there are it's

985
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,840
known that there are 20

986
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,119
or more by now uh regions and states

987
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,719
that have adopted it

988
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,639
and it covers big portion of the

989
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,839
population so

990
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,839
with all the difficulties and

991
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,879
difficulties were expected and are still

992
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,159
expected

993
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,879
things are moving so so in

994
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,440
uh so then we'll we'll postpone the the

995
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,560
risks

996
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,040
question that i'm aiming for for stefano

997
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,719
uh to to maybe piggyback on what you

998
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,639
just mentioned mote so

999
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,638
uh there were a lot of questions by the

1000
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,599
regarding interoperability so i don't

1001
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,959
know who wants to answer this i know

1002
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,760
that carmella was involved in

1003
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,119
interoperability in europe so but if

1004
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
anyone wants to comment on how

1005
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,839
interoperability

1006
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,119
works or can it be even done or is are

1007
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,679
there any challenges that you want to

1008
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,679
speak about

1009
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,520
so um how these apps uh

1010
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,119
work right is that we have

1011
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,640
bluetooth speakers that go around you

1012
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,680
record because that you see

1013
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,279
eventually you get sick you upload uh

1014
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,879
your key that allows to drive this

1015
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
business to a server the rest of the

1016
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
phones

1017
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,760
uh get these keys and they can check

1018
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
what they have seen you and then compute

1019
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
with the data that they collected

1020
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,599
whether

1021
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,760
this exposure has been long enough so

1022
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,839
when we want to interoperability with

1023
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,680
in countries we want that the people

1024
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,759
that visited the country

1025
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,279
and therefore so becomes from that

1026
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,320
country or in the case of

1027
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,800
uh the united states this can be states

1028
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,680
they are able to get access to the keys

1029
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,880
from that

1030
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,399
place that is not their home and

1031
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,680
also that um the other way around

1032
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,359
right that um kids from the these people

1033
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,440
that have visited that country

1034
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,200
are accessible to the citizens of that

1035
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,359
other country so that they can check if

1036
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,240
this person when they went home was sick

1037
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,400
they still get notified so we need uh

1038
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,879
something that makes these two flows

1039
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,480
uh happen and this can be done in many

1040
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
ways right the first thing that

1041
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,839
one thing is just a normal peer-to-peer

1042
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,200
in which the service

1043
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,279
between the countries to send these

1044
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,040
things to each other uh

1045
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,560
the current solution in europe seems to

1046
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,279
be a gateway server that

1047
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,599
just makes it's a relay basically that

1048
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,040
just

1049
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,040
instead having appeared to be we have a

1050
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,119
star topology in which we sent

1051
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,800
to this um gateway server and then the

1052
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,040
server distributors the key

1053
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,560
elsewhere and this way you can ensure

1054
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,960
that everyone kind of gets

1055
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,880
access to all of the possible matches

1056
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,119
that you have

1057
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,960
so this part is kind of very simple and

1058
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,960
in this sense uh the google and apple

1059
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,920
api kind of facilitate this a lot

1060
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,320
because that means that

1061
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,119
all of us are running the same protocol

1062
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,960
and that

1063
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,640
even if you're in another country and

1064
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
you would need to

1065
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,640
get access to that particular country

1066
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,200
system you can install the app

1067
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,400
and still get the beacons that you have

1068
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,118
in the lower part of the system

1069
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,440
okay so we can follow up with you on on

1070
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
on

1071
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,720
on that on that because there was a lot

1072
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,000
of discussion slack on that but i want

1073
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,720
to switch topics to

1074
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,480
to something that uh stefano mentioned

1075
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,839
in his in his intro and that that are

1076
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,400
all the risks so you mentioned the

1077
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,078
number of

1078
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,720
possible attacks on these systems and

1079
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,440
some are unavoidable risks right i mean

1080
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,319
they're

1081
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,079
they're sort of they're there to stay so

1082
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,560
you know how do you do a risk analysis

1083
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,640
on this

1084
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,560
and and you know do you find the risks

1085
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,240
acceptable and this is maybe also a

1086
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,799
question to moti who probably looked

1087
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,240
into that

1088
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,240
as well in carmella so can you can you

1089
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,839
comment on that all these relay attacks

1090
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,720
all these uh all these possible privacy

1091
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,040
attacks and so forth should i start okay

1092
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,118
so

1093
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,400
so okay so first of all i think many in

1094
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,480
the audience know and then here on the

1095
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,560
panel so it's a it's a bit of an imposed

1096
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,320
question how do we do a risk analysis on

1097
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,599
an entire deployed system on a in a

1098
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,359
rigorous way so

1099
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,560
so i agree with i agree with martin

1100
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,000
that's definitely a lesson i learned as

1101
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,839
a cryptographer going through the entire

1102
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,079
contact racing experience that

1103
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,839
if you want to deploy things at scale uh

1104
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,839
you need to make some compromises

1105
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,359
and the one compromise that was made

1106
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,119
here for scalability

1107
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,040
that i think just to be clear i was

1108
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,880
referring to in the panel is the issue

1109
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
that as a positive user so once you

1110
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
report

1111
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,480
positive and you're authorized to

1112
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,560
applaud to the system

1113
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,079
the identifiers that you broadcast that

1114
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,440
you have broadcast over the last

1115
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,200
two weeks or whatever period health

1116
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,599
authorities decide is relevant

1117
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
um can be linked together either across

1118
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,320
days typically this will be across an

1119
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,839
individual day

1120
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,440
and the question is should we be

1121
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,119
concerned about this uh so this is one

1122
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,560
type of attack that this particular the

1123
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,000
one that affects privacy should be

1124
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,599
should be concerned about this or

1125
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,839
another i think here you know the real

1126
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,079
risk analysis is very subjective right

1127
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,400
so some of us might be fine with this

1128
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,800
just because we think that once we are

1129
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
uh positive we it's not a big loss to

1130
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,079
potentially rebuild this information and

1131
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
of course granted that it takes some

1132
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,320
effort

1133
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,078
to be able to make this information

1134
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,640
useful that would be having some

1135
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,920
antennas uh in the surveillance

1136
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,680
equipment being

1137
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,599
distributed on a certain territory and

1138
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,240
that's definitely a non-trivial attack

1139
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,680
to mount

1140
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,040
so i think it's important here the only

1141
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,799
thing i can say it's important for users

1142
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,599
to understand this risk and they can

1143
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,000
decide

1144
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,440
individually whether they they they are

1145
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,960
willing to take the risk or not

1146
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,640
also i think another issue is that one

1147
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,680
needs to measure how

1148
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,598
um for example an important question is

1149
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,359
can user be coerced

1150
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,960
to upload and maybe this is something

1151
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,560
that can be made as high as possible as

1152
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,079
a local policy that health authorities

1153
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,440
can be pay attention to

1154
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,359
uh there are other risks that are

1155
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,920
related to uh

1156
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,359
relay and replay attacks uh so here i

1157
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
think these are mostly attacks that can

1158
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,400
create a number of false positives in

1159
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,920
the system

1160
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,599
i am a bit personally less concerned

1161
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,160
about them maybe people can disagree

1162
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,480
here

1163
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,160
i feel if the reliability of the system

1164
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,200
becomes affected at some point things

1165
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,078
are going to look

1166
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,720
obvious at least in certain areas and

1167
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,200
then

1168
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,799
some interventions can be made and the

1169
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,240
worst that can happen of course is that

1170
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
the system is not trusted which is

1171
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,799
definitely a big

1172
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,960
big deal if you want the system to be

1173
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,880
effective but it will not affect

1174
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
privacy of individual users some of

1175
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
these attacks can be

1176
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,760
prevented um to a certain degree there

1177
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,720
have been some solutions that are

1178
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,000
proposed but again

1179
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,919
for different policy and technical

1180
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,720
reasons are hard to uh

1181
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,119
to to to scale and also to adopt another

1182
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,799
thing

1183
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,640
that i want to point out is that some of

1184
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,599
these risks are not going to go away and

1185
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
this is something which is very

1186
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,040
important for me to stress

1187
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,040
if we adopt even solutions with with

1188
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,640
better security so the attacks become a

1189
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,040
little bit higher there

1190
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,078
but it's very hard to make even a risk

1191
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,920
analysis of what is

1192
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
what is leaked in a perfectly secure

1193
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,560
solution that just implements the ideal

1194
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,240
functionality

1195
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,119
if you're using this in a situation

1196
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,759
where there's a limited number of cases

1197
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,079
uh just the fact that suddenly two users

1198
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,280
receive an exposure alert

1199
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,880
they might be able to conclude that

1200
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,960
these belong to the same user especially

1201
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,800
if they are closing in close proximity

1202
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,160
so it's a very hard it's a very hard

1203
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,000
question to answer so

1204
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,359
and i think uh you know the situation is

1205
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,400
there to stay and the only thing we can

1206
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,400
do is inform users

1207
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,160
what do you want to say something on

1208
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,560
this or yeah yeah i can

1209
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,160
i can state a few things first of all

1210
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,359
the

1211
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,440
the api is is is named exposure

1212
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,839
notification so trying to

1213
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,160
apply complete privacy to something that

1214
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,880
is called exposure

1215
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,040
is an oxymoron so you have to understand

1216
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,720
that to start with just starting the

1217
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,400
system and doing something you have

1218
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,720
certain exposures

1219
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:24,079
now in the state of thinking about

1220
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,319
uh about it both

1221
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,640
in both companies and independently in

1222
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,160
the both companies we came up with a lot

1223
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,640
of the

1224
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,078
other academic paper attacks and

1225
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,319
concerns and we

1226
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,319
we boiled them into and we had to do

1227
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,839
i actually it's not exactly only risk

1228
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,599
analysis but it's a utility

1229
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,880
versus risk analysis because

1230
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,119
we were aware i mean with the entire

1231
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,440
group of engineers both companies were

1232
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,200
aware of the capabilities

1233
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,040
of uh ble what what can be done what can

1234
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,919
be done more reliably

1235
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,520
what can be measured and so on i mean we

1236
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,040
we are still studying it

1237
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,599
of course carefully and but

1238
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,200
uh this was known and then all the risks

1239
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,040
all the exposure

1240
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,118
what what makes sense what does not make

1241
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,119
sense the biggest exposure

1242
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,079
what would change maybe maybe uh there

1243
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
was a question on the on slack and i

1244
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,800
want to capture it because i think it's

1245
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,119
an interesting one

1246
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,640
how comfortable would uh would all of

1247
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,440
you be um

1248
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,480
in if these uh if these contact tracing

1249
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,520
apps would be

1250
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,640
deployed per company or in companies so

1251
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,520
reducing this

1252
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,000
this this context so if because there

1253
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,759
are

1254
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,760
there are ideas to deploy them in

1255
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,400
various companies where people work

1256
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,480
because of the unavailability in certain

1257
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,800
jurisdictions so

1258
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,680
any opinions on that the first thing i

1259
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,800
have to say

1260
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,040
is that obligation by employers or

1261
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,720
restaurants to use these apps was one of

1262
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,520
our main concerns that people would be

1263
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,000
discriminated for not having the app

1264
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,520
we are discovering that this goes the

1265
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,560
other way around

1266
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,480
in particular companies do not want the

1267
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,000
user the employers

1268
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,839
to the the employees to use these apps

1269
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,920
we're finding this a lot because people

1270
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,279
don't want to have notifications because

1271
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,160
then people need to quarantine and they

1272
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,440
don't work

1273
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,839
and this seems to be problematic

1274
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,760
so that's one thing and honestly i don't

1275
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,400
know carly if you foresee that

1276
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,960
that's something i had not foreseen that

1277
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,520
that was an

1278
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,960
opposite um on the other hand i find

1279
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,319
that the deployment of this kind of

1280
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,839
technology is internal

1281
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,000
for a company kind of dangerous

1282
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,040
because depending that the company in

1283
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,359
particular in the us

1284
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,319
when then you do not have the right to

1285
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,000
privacy

1286
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,759
what prevents the company from also

1287
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,440
putting bluetooth delivers and actually

1288
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,000
to all of these tracking things that we

1289
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,160
believe that they have very low risk

1290
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,240
in public they start to have very high

1291
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,839
risk when you put this on a warehouse or

1292
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,919
inside on things like this

1293
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,839
so i would be very very wary of

1294
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,280
deploying this type of technologies

1295
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,720
and i would be much more helpful if

1296
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,160
these companies actually would put

1297
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,078
pressure on their governments

1298
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,000
to deploy the national park instead of

1299
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,079
doing it themselves

1300
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,119
i don't know carly if you want to yeah i

1301
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,160
i mean i agree with

1302
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,560
most of uh everything carmel says i'm i

1303
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,839
i mean firstly also from a from a

1304
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,400
pragmatic perspective how would

1305
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,040
companies

1306
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,560
enforce such a obligation would they

1307
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,560
require employees to open their phone

1308
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,319
and show that the app was being in use

1309
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,599
that bluetooth had been enabled that

1310
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,440
they were carrying their phone with them

1311
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,560
i think that that practically it's a

1312
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,240
difficult

1313
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,599
requirement to enforce i think what

1314
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,359
we're more likely to see

1315
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,960
rather than companies require employees

1316
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,240
to use exposure notification apps is

1317
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,599
companies require

1318
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,200
employees to use what is likely to come

1319
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,000
next which is around immunity

1320
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,879
passport or immunity verification tools

1321
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,520
or apps so

1322
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,960
something that would establish a either

1323
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,240
a vaccination status

1324
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,960
or antibody tests

1325
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,319
and making that a attempt to make that a

1326
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,880
prerequisite to

1327
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,400
entering a workplace and there from a

1328
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,319
legal perspective you get into a whole

1329
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,240
range of different problems because

1330
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,759
under the gdpr in europe sorry not under

1331
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,439
the gdpr under various pieces of

1332
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,560
legislation at least in the uk and i

1333
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,280
think some of it's married

1334
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,480
in europe uh you can't require employees

1335
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,560
to take certain

1336
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,680
tests before returning to work and it

1337
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,440
might um

1338
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,279
invoke something like discrimination on

1339
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,280
the basis of health status if you're not

1340
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,040
able to enter a place because you don't

1341
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,720
have immunity to chronovirus

1342
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,160
so i think that we're getting into quite

1343
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,680
dicey territory when we talk about kind

1344
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,920
of mandatory

1345
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,279
um requirements to use any types of

1346
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,599
technologies and

1347
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,079
and really practically a difficulty in

1348
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,160
in enforcement actually

1349
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,599
i want to now now switch maybe topics

1350
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,118
and and and

1351
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:54,000
uh ask jiro a couple of questions so we

1352
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,440
so first of all uh you you have been

1353
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,920
doing a lot of work with uh

1354
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,520
ble so bluetooth technologies and and

1355
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,640
and tracking contacts and so on in

1356
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,240
different contexts

1357
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,839
and so is is this the right technology i

1358
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,359
mean are there any other technologies

1359
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,599
that would work better in terms of

1360
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,640
tracking context or studying this this

1361
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,839
this area

1362
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,680
in general you know and also in terms of

1363
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,520
digital contact tracing

1364
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,040
is this is what we are getting out of

1365
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,520
such systems too narrow

1366
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,720
is there you know what more as computer

1367
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,160
scientists

1368
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,240
could be provide to to help this

1369
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,160
to help the epidemiologists or the

1370
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,399
governments you know better manage

1371
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,560
manage this situation is this what we

1372
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,359
are currently doing somewhat narrow or

1373
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,359
how do you see this

1374
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,079
um on the on the first question

1375
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,480
it's important to to remark that using

1376
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,520
digital proxies in particular using

1377
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,599
low power radio signals to study close

1378
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,839
range proximity of humans

1379
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,960
is not a new idea there is at least one

1380
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,240
decade of

1381
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,440
research on on using all sorts of

1382
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,680
digital proxies

1383
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,880
to mine for proximity relations of

1384
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,839
individuals

1385
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,640
and we know that these signals are

1386
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,960
useful

1387
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,598
to study infectious disease dynamics

1388
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,319
especially in hospital settings

1389
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,280
and in and in variety of other settings

1390
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:19,279
so

1391
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:22,720
the fact that we can use a digital proxy

1392
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,520
to inform modeling strategies

1393
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,520
and and targeted interventions aimed at

1394
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,200
mitigating epidemic spread

1395
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,800
for an airborne pathogen is something

1396
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,359
that uh that we know

1397
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,960
as a fact now the thing is that a lot of

1398
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,720
the literature

1399
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,359
and a lot of the studies that we were

1400
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,279
carried out in the last 10 15 years

1401
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,558
in this space have you specialized

1402
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,599
technologies custom technology

1403
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:51,280
all sorts of low power

1404
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,559
radio devices infrared bass proximity a

1405
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,599
mix of

1406
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,079
different type of signal multi-modal

1407
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,400
devices and so on and so forth so

1408
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,160
typically these devices were designed

1409
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,200
from the outset

1410
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,640
to sense for specific spatial relations

1411
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,480
of the individuals wearing them

1412
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,160
individuals typically are asked

1413
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,720
where this device is in a controlled

1414
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,078
fashion normally this yields

1415
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,720
higher quality proximity sensing

1416
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,520
and downstream better proxies for the

1417
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,319
for the spatial relations that we think

1418
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,280
are most relevant for for the spread of

1419
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,720
the disease

1420
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,559
so we don't have this luxury with

1421
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,598
bluetooth uh bluetooth uh

1422
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,839
uh comparing like the

1423
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,240
the use of bluetooth with with the state

1424
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,759
of the art of these other efforts

1425
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,680
there are two main problems the first

1426
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,160
one is that there is a

1427
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,078
massive heterogeneity in the radio

1428
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,279
interfaces of different bluetooth

1429
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,520
chipsets

1430
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,440
and of course we can we can somehow like

1431
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,000
fix this by calibrating uh

1432
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,240
creating databases of calibration uh

1433
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,880
information for the different devices

1434
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,720
and this is being done as you know uh

1435
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,200
the second thing is that there is a lot

1436
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,879
of

1437
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,919
herogenity in the behaviors

1438
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,480
of wearing a smartphone on your body and

1439
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,480
using

1440
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,240
a smartphone and of course as you

1441
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,960
imagine if the if the smartphone is

1442
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,118
sitting

1443
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,480
in the back of your pocket or if you're

1444
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,400
holding it in your hands if you're

1445
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,960
holding it in your hands

1446
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,800
in front of a metal surface imagine a

1447
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,960
metal table in a cafeteria

1448
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,640
all of these things can make a big

1449
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,839
difference however

1450
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,480
we do know that if you filter for long

1451
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,400
lasting

1452
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,800
strong contacts you you you pay a steep

1453
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,400
price in terms of recall

1454
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,280
but you do tend to get high quality

1455
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,920
epidemiologically relevant

1456
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,040
uh contacts and and this is why it's so

1457
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,520
complex to actually

1458
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,359
fine tune how digital counter tracing

1459
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,160
dovetails with manual contact racing

1460
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,839
because

1461
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,680
it's really a complementary type of

1462
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,279
signal we are dealing with a proxy

1463
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,839
and there are many knobs that we can

1464
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,280
turn that that control

1465
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,319
uh how these behaves in in complement

1466
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,800
with the rest of the

1467
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,240
system keep in mind that going forward

1468
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,160
we are looking at

1469
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,078
a slow burn from this epidemic this is

1470
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,078
not going away fast of course

1471
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,520
even in situation where you control it

1472
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:16,079
you will keep seeing

1473
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:19,280
like uh bouts of of epidemic uh

1474
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:22,559
locally and and so having uh having

1475
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:26,000
um some communities where the

1476
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,559
adoption of the app is higher will allow

1477
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,920
us to stave off those kind of outbreaks

1478
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,400
and of course

1479
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,040
we there are biases in the populations

1480
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,839
that will

1481
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,359
uh will be able to use these devices but

1482
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,160
keep in mind that they don't translate

1483
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,160
trivially

1484
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,759
into biases in the benefits because we

1485
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,040
are dealing with an epidemic which is a

1486
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,160
network process

1487
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,319
so we have a lot of network effects and

1488
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,399
and it's not simply that because of the

1489
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,558
biased population of smartphone users

1490
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,880
then then only those guys benefit

1491
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,480
um that there are network effects and

1492
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,559
and if we if you are above

1493
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,319
some of the good relevant thresholds

1494
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,640
that many people are starting right now

1495
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:06,319
everybody will benefit uh out of this

1496
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,480
final comment i mean bluetooth is the

1497
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,558
technology we have today i mean

1498
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,480
uh there are there are some operational

1499
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,359
constraints here like i'm i am part of

1500
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,160
the italian

1501
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,000
government uh covered 19 task force and

1502
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,640
from the outset we were going to have an

1503
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,400
app

1504
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,160
so that this was never under decision

1505
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,000
there was going to be an app

1506
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,759
and and so of course i second what

1507
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,400
carmella said we

1508
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,839
we went eventually for the most privacy

1509
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,119
preserving one

1510
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:35,440
because of the non-trivial cost benefit

1511
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,880
trade-offs and so you want to minimize

1512
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,839
the potential

1513
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,280
harm because you're going to get that

1514
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,119
for sure whereas the public health

1515
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,119
benefits are something that we are still

1516
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,480
investigating even in the interest of

1517
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,160
time i want to ask you two

1518
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,480
to two more questions and others are

1519
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,480
also uh welcome to answer so

1520
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
there was there was one number floated

1521
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,839
in the in the in the news

1522
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
that one needs 60 or more people to

1523
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,440
install

1524
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,079
install an app for for this to work and

1525
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,920
the second

1526
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,839
issue was you know how concerned are you

1527
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,440
about the inaccuracies of bluetooth

1528
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,839
distance measurement

1529
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,280
um you know so because some people might

1530
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,240
might see this as being

1531
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,559
as being um a show stopper for this kind

1532
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,200
of

1533
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,160
this this kind of apps so maybe you can

1534
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,759
discuss these

1535
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,640
these kinds i'll i'll quickly take a

1536
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,839
second uh regarding the second

1537
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,078
no proxy is perfect and

1538
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,880
bluetooth-based proximity is not going

1539
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,480
to be perfect

1540
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,640
but keep in mind that also manual

1541
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,800
contact tracing is not perfect

1542
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,558
because it relies on people remembering

1543
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,680
contacts and people are

1544
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,359
known to have recalled biases or they

1545
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,399
simply might lack the information to

1546
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,440
recall where a given contact was

1547
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,760
didn't happen um so so i think that this

1548
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,240
is

1549
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,760
just another proxy that we are using

1550
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,160
it's important to

1551
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,520
uh to state clearly that this is a

1552
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,520
complement to whatever

1553
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,040
else we are doing we are not going to

1554
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,119
get out of this with an app

1555
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,040
of course nobody at this stage is so

1556
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:07,119
naive to think that right

1557
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,200
but but this can be a useful low cost

1558
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,040
option on the cost side i would like to

1559
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,319
say that i'm familiar with the italian

1560
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,480
experience

1561
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,520
in italy the the cost of developing the

1562
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,760
app was

1563
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,960
was sustained entirely by the company by

1564
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,720
the private company

1565
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,240
who developed the app and then donated

1566
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,799
the service code to the

1567
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,879
to the government and so in a sense the

1568
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,079
cost of developing the app itself and

1569
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,000
the cost of deploying

1570
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,800
it was relatively low actually and

1571
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,599
probably abysmal compared to the massive

1572
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,000
costs

1573
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,440
that that all of our systems and

1574
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,760
countries are seeing

1575
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,599
uh because of the coronal virus crisis

1576
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,640
so this is for the second question

1577
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,760
uh regarding the the the question the

1578
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,319
the quality uh of the

1579
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,240
of the of the signal uh as i mentioned

1580
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,440
it's not perfect but it's what uh it's

1581
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,879
what we have today

1582
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,119
and uh so is that

1583
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,240
something that uh oh yeah oh yeah sorry

1584
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,599
sorry that mixed up

1585
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,879
um the yeah that comes out of

1586
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,000
um the oxford study i would say

1587
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,760
largely a misinterpretation of the

1588
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,400
of the early work by ferretti and fraser

1589
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,680
there was not such a threshold that of

1590
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,119
course as you imagine

1591
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,240
uh the from from basic principles the

1592
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,720
benefit that you get

1593
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,160
in terms of contact recall is quadratic

1594
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,118
in the up adoption because you are

1595
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,399
involving

1596
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:33,359
two subjects right so you need to have

1597
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,280
a relatively high uptake of the app in

1598
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,799
order to see strong benefits but but

1599
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,200
keep in mind that you're not using

1600
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,799
only the apple you're not using the app

1601
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,799
in a in a fully

1602
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,240
homogeneous population which is one of

1603
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,280
the strong assumption actually of the

1604
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,919
model by

1605
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,200
uh by by ferretin and fresher and we

1606
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,440
know that the heterogeneities in this

1607
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,799
respect are probably helping us

1608
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,720
and and also

1609
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,240
there isn't really no rational effect so

1610
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,439
you have a benefit which might be

1611
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,399
smaller with a

1612
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,200
with a very small adoption but it does

1613
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,079
increase

1614
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,919
uh with with adoption and so there is a

1615
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,520
benefit there and if you can utilize the

1616
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,160
potential harm

1617
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,839
this is surely uh helpful that said as

1618
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,720
carmela was saying we are in the early

1619
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,720
days

1620
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,640
uh the systems we have deployed uh

1621
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,160
actually by design provide us with solid

1622
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,680
epidemiological information that is

1623
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,440
difficult to assess

1624
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,040
the actual impact but i expect that the

1625
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,880
public health authorities

1626
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,640
of the country is deploying this app so

1627
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,119
we'll start providing these ups in the

1628
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,799
next

1629
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,880
in the in the coming weeks and months

1630
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,280
but we are really in the early days

1631
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,359
okay thank you so this is a security

1632
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,920
conference so we see a lot of questions

1633
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,319
uh on slack also related to potential

1634
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,160
attacks so i will circle back to one

1635
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,400
to one attack that that people seem to

1636
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,480
be uh very fond of and

1637
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,440
and are exploring and that's that's some

1638
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,559
sort of

1639
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,880
propagation of false infections in

1640
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,079
environments so

1641
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,680
can anyone comment on that uh i mean

1642
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,680
there were a number of reports that were

1643
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,558
written on these topics already but

1644
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,078
maybe maybe someone can summarize uh

1645
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,040
what the main issues are and

1646
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,720
and what the uh and how at least the

1647
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,880
current framework

1648
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,759
defends against that or addresses it at

1649
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,839
least partially

1650
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,839
if not entirely

1651
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,558
i can say something but if i i think

1652
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,559
oh marty you can yeah

1653
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,559
i think search surgeon is the expert to

1654
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,759
answer

1655
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:35,280
just moderating so this time i'll

1656
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,400
i'll let stefano uh pick this up

1657
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,520
so no i think there are two concerns

1658
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,960
here and i'm not sure which one the

1659
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,480
question was referring to i mostly

1660
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
wanted to make this distinction right so

1661
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,640
there

1662
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,559
i think an issue that has been discussed

1663
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,078
a lot at the beginning

1664
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,000
and there have been several blog posts

1665
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,319
about it and discussed in articles was

1666
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,319
really

1667
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,599
the issue that false reports are being

1668
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,079
done and

1669
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,760
that part is is really not an issue when

1670
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,000
integration without authority is taking

1671
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,000
place

1672
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,599
so there are several mechanisms with

1673
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,280
different degrees of sophistication that

1674
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,480
can be adopted most of the solutions are

1675
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
used pin codes but

1676
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,839
clever things can also be done in

1677
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,440
distributing trust between the central

1678
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,599
servers and authorities

1679
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,280
uh to to authenticate uploads that is

1680
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,359
not really the issue

1681
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,040
uh at this point i think the one issue

1682
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,520
is exactly the one related to

1683
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,160
relay and replay attacks which uh can

1684
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,759
still affect

1685
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,200
that's of course a much harder attack to

1686
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,760
mount and uh

1687
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,799
that i don't have a clear evidence-based

1688
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,079
analysis of

1689
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,440
you know how feasible these things are

1690
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,119
going to happen but they are

1691
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,880
technologically more sophisticated yeah

1692
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,400
i also invite people to read all the all

1693
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,640
the reports and there have been a number

1694
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,720
now generated on this topic so

1695
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,240
i think it would take some time so we

1696
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,919
have three minutes left and and

1697
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,520
and i would like to go back to the

1698
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,760
question that i asked shira but

1699
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,880
there wasn't time to answer and that's

1700
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,839
what else

1701
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,559
do you think we as a community should

1702
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,119
because

1703
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,839
should be doing except of this contact

1704
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,920
tracing

1705
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:57,440
that we somehow focused on so there was

1706
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,760
a lot of i could see

1707
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,000
in the community a lot of uh willingness

1708
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,880
a lot of positive energy to to build all

1709
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,520
these apps and

1710
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,160
and contact racing systems and people

1711
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,920
and as

1712
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,839
shear also mentioned a lot of companies

1713
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,559
as well everyone jumped on board to do

1714
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,480
something

1715
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,839
you know entirely for free to benefit

1716
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,480
the society so

1717
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,680
is there something more that we could be

1718
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,599
doing

1719
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,720
except you know making sure that contact

1720
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,760
racing is

1721
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,879
as best as it can be

1722
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:30,640
so i mean you have a

1723
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,000
we have now 230 plus people on

1724
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,598
on this uh attending this panel so maybe

1725
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,640
you can inspire someone to do something

1726
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:40,000
good so cheers

1727
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,960
i i i'll share just one bit um i i think

1728
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,720
that

1729
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,400
it comes with complex trade-offs but the

1730
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,598
possibility of creating privacy

1731
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,359
preserving risk maps of locations

1732
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,520
might be useful of course there is there

1733
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,279
are very strong arguments for not using

1734
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,920
location data at all

1735
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,599
and and this is at the core of uh of

1736
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,520
many of the designs that we are involved

1737
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,640
i mean i'm also part of the

1738
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,880
episode here's the benefit of now here's

1739
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,118
the benefit of not having this panel in

1740
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,640
in person because i think carmela would

1741
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,720
sort of oppose the use of location

1742
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,319
no i'm also i'm also very i'm also very

1743
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,598
skeptical that this can be done

1744
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:20,000
at all in any in any safe way

1745
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,880
but but location is certainly an

1746
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,240
important

1747
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,799
an important proxy and and so

1748
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,839
like i'm answering your question like if

1749
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,319
we could

1750
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,160
uh raise the bar of what we can do in

1751
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:35,520
terms of

1752
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,598
using co-location data and and create

1753
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:41,200
privacy preserving

1754
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:44,319
risk maps in a distributed fashion

1755
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,359
this this could possibly be useful for

1756
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:47,440
epidemiologists

1757
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,279
but i do agree and you know again i have

1758
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,400
to say it i'm part of the dp3t

1759
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,760
collaboration myself

1760
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,079
that uh right now uh using location data

1761
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,319
as far as i'm concerned is a big no and

1762
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:02,720
it's important that this is considered

1763
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:02,720
at the outset a hard constraint

1764
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,319
okay so thank you any any last uh

1765
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,440
thoughts any anything that you wanted to

1766
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,160
say and uh

1767
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,119
you didn't have time well one one one

1768
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:17,839
one thing is that security experts are

1769
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,400
very good in analyzing the worst case or

1770
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,839
the

1771
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:26,160
attack but risk management

1772
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:28,240
is much more probabilistic much more

1773
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,118
about possibilities and much more

1774
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,439
trading utility versus gain

1775
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,440
and you have to be very careful when you

1776
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,359
discourage people from using the app

1777
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,799
because somebody can die

1778
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:42,078
so you know it's it's a balanced

1779
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,400
approach and you have to

1780
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:47,040
take it in moderation everybody will be

1781
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:51,920
considered everybody can be heard

1782
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,920
but do it responsibly

1783
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,200
there is also another point which was

1784
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,200
made on the slack channel

1785
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,480
don't forget how invasive the intrusive

1786
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,879
privacy why

1787
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,880
is manual contact tracing and how that

1788
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,480
information once materialized can be

1789
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,480
abused

1790
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,760
so scaling up manual contact tracing

1791
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,880
also comes with

1792
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,920
with huge privacy risks and having

1793
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:17,280
a surrogate complement such as digital

1794
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,960
contact tracing can certainly help

1795
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,559
and the other thing i would say is that

1796
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,240
we when we talk about it we have been

1797
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,160
concentrating on the bluetooth side and

1798
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,000
that part of the protocol but as i said

1799
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,160
in my presentation there are so many

1800
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,839
other mechanisms that need to be built

1801
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,598
that depend on the capabilities we have

1802
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,558
on the phone and that we need

1803
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,920
much more research on how do we protect

1804
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,240
network communications

1805
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,240
how do we get better authentication can

1806
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,439
we get better authentication without

1807
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,200
having to trust the

1808
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,400
phone there are a lot of low-hanging

1809
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,439
fruits and i would love to see this

1810
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,200
community

1811
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,799
building not only on the protocol but

1812
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,078
also on the other parts that are

1813
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:52,319
essentially for the security and the

1814
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,839
privacy of the system

1815
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,640
can i come in with one final comment

1816
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:59,440
saying as uh morty has baited me so much

1817
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,759
to say something which is only that um

1818
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,200
we

1819
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,480
we have to remember that this is the

1820
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,919
challenge is not only getting people to

1821
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,480
download the app it's getting them to

1822
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,400
use it

1823
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,920
regularly to abide by the notifications

1824
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,480
they receive over a very long period of

1825
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,160
time

1826
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,079
in order to do that you need to build

1827
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,680
trust you need to be build public trust

1828
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,520
in the app and some of that comes with

1829
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,759
privacy preserving measures other comes

1830
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,440
with processes and governance and the

1831
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,680
system in which the app's being used and

1832
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,520
so what we found in the uk is actually

1833
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,598
using communications rhetoric

1834
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,720
such as you know you have to do this

1835
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,559
because people will die

1836
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,319
actually doesn't get that public trust

1837
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,319
element across and the way the

1838
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,599
nhs has actually reframed communications

1839
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,279
around the app is to

1840
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,520
say this is a good thing for you this is

1841
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,599
how you get access to society again this

1842
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,280
is how you get to go to restaurants and

1843
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,319
movie theaters et cetera and i think

1844
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,280
there's i mean that's a whole other

1845
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,119
conversation about how

1846
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,799
what the public communication challenge

1847
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,440
is there in around getting people to use

1848
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,640
it but

1849
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,520
i i know we're at the end of

1850
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,440
conversation now but yeah

1851
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,119
i just have one line i wanted to say

1852
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,280
this is the second carmilla and

1853
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,240
and zero so in minor counter tracing and

1854
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,359
the bigger picture

1855
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,879
so it's really important for this

1856
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,319
community also to understand we haven't

1857
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,160
discussed it at all that when we talk

1858
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,599
about contact tracing apps it's really

1859
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,078
not just ble

1860
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,920
so we we are seeing a proliferation of

1861
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,640
all sorts of other apps and solutions

1862
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,440
that have

1863
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,279
security and privacy issues so just we

1864
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,720
couldn't discuss this today but to keep

1865
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,480
an eye also on that because there's a

1866
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,919
lot happening there

1867
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,520
absolutely i think that's a that's a

1868
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,079
great summary uh clearly

1869
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,839
um yeah it was a short time so we

1870
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,920
clearly focused on something that's uh

1871
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,599
prevalently deployed but

1872
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,799
there are a lot of works and i i'm sure

1873
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,240
that there will be a number of

1874
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,680
submissions and there are already a

1875
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,319
number of submissions

1876
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,558
along uh contact tracing and um and

1877
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,200
similar technologies to

1878
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,280
to all major conferences so be nice to

1879
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:47,118
the submissions as you usually are

1880
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,960
i guess and um and so

1881
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,559
