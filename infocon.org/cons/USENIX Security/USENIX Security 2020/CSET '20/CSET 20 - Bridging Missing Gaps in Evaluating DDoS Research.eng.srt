00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,280
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
the title of our work is bridging

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,560
missing gaps in

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:20,320
evaluating ddos research i am lumen

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,320
my co-authors are sam deputy and jin

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,480
we are from the university of oregon

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,599
without further ado let's take a quick

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,840
look at the ddos attacks today

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
most reported attacks today are easy to

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
detect and

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,399
mitigate due to their common patterns

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
however attacks have started to employ

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,719
advanced

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,440
techniques for example we see many

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,559
reports

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,559
on the posting based attacks and carpet

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,760
bombing attacks

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,839
we'll present a brief introduction to

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,718
these newer attacks in the following

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,920
slides

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,840
a posing based attack aims to flood

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,119
network links with short and

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
periodic traffic bursts

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,159
here we show a possible link utilization

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
graph during a posing based attack

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,240
the attack traffic bursts are indicated

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,479
by the red parts in the figure

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,280
and we can see the burst come and go at

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,759
certain frequency

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
the detection of such an attack requires

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,920
fine-grained

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,798
time series network information

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,479
the main consequence of this attack is

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
to reduce the quality of

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,280
real-time applications such as online

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,280
gaming

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
the attack could also reduce the network

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,640
throughput of congestion

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,040
responsive flows as implied by the

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
figure

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,079
a carpet bombing attack addresses

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,479
multiple networks of a network

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
the detection difficulty varies based on

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,880
the traffic payload

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,919
and the detection point of view for

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
example

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
if the attacker employs the scheme from

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,399
the crossfire attack

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,759
the detection difficulty is way higher

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,759
than a tcp zinc flood

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
the consequences are two-fold first edge

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,280
networks

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,680
such as a b and c will experience low

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,400
network throughputs albeit their inbound

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,400
links are not congested

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,280
second since sx is also a victim of the

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
attack

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
it may perform ddos mitigation to

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,000
protect its

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,079
inbound link however x does not

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
always have the filtering requirements

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,720
from a b and c

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,800
as a consequence x may filter critical

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
traffic towards its downstream networks

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
now we list notable ddos evaluation

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
missing gaps

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
based on our survey

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,400
first while not too surprising we think

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
ddos attacks

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
are only going to be more advanced and

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,239
we need to be aware of

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,238
this trend unfortunately

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,879
we know very little of these advanced

74
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,239
attacks in action

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,879
most researchers hardly have access to

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
production traffic and manipulate the

77
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,560
traffic

78
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,159
therefore to many of us we need to study

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,720
these advanced attacks and emulations

80
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
due to the design of the advanced

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,319
attacks

82
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
to evaluate them many require realistic

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,440
background traffic

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
or layer 5 application traffic

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,680
the second missing gap is to better

86
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,000
detection evaluations

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
as a ddos detection system is to serve

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
better attack mitigation we should not

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
evaluate

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
a detection system only using passive

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
network trace

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,400
instead to claim the soundness of a

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
detections evaluation

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
the evaluation needs to be able to

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,120
answer questions such as

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,360
how the system handles significant

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,439
network changes caused by mitigation

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
effort

99
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,560
such an evaluation requires both

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
realistic

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
background traffic and mitigation system

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
in the loop

103
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,799
last but not least we should understand

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
the collateral damage

105
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,638
caused by ddos mitigation during a

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
mitigation

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,040
the victim often knowingly or

108
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:34,000
unknowingly disconnects benign traffic

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,800
using solutions such as rtbh

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,400
in many cases using rtbh is helping the

111
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
attacker to finish the attack

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
while more networks start to adapt

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
fine-grained mitigation solutions such

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,240
as flow spec

115
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,720
routers have limited filtering capacity

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
it ranges anywhere from hundreds to

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
thousands of

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
filters therefore we often see a victim

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,919
uses

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,280
broad traffic matching conditions in

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,240
mitigation

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,758
at the cost of disconnecting benign

123
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
hosts

124
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,880
that is assuming the bot ips are already

125
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
validated by the victim to study the

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
collateral damage

127
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
we also need to have realistic ip

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
assignment

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
in experiments

130
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
with the motivation concluded we now

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
introduce our

132
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,000
sandbox project

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
at a high level the sandbox system

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
leverages the

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,719
container technology the design choice

136
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,120
comes with many benefits

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
including but not limited to low

138
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,039
deployment friction

139
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,759
and elastic system fidelity

140
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,440
fundamentally since the container uses

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,960
linux namespaces

142
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,400
the overhead to build such a

143
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,239
immunization network is generally

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
lower than a virtual machine based

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,319
platform

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
we pack different node images into the

147
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,919
system and

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,840
once instantiated we have containers

149
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,840
which

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,840
represents nodes in a experiment

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,479
in this system it is also easy to manage

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,199
both physical and virtual network

153
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,199
interfaces

154
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,639
the sandbox usage model is rather simple

155
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,960
if a user wants a

156
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
functional network or defined as a mini

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
internet in our paper

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
the system only requires a traffic trace

159
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
or stream

160
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
the topology generator will gather

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,159
required

162
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
public data sets to build a functional

163
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,319
network

164
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,080
then the traffic mimicker generates

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,240
background traffic by reading the

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,758
traffic trace or stream

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,360
and recreates network flows using system

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
sockets

169
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
we also include reference node images to

170
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,159
represent

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,039
routers and and hosts in fact

172
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,840
the traffic mimicker is type of and host

173
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,039
in the

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,119
sandbox

175
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,639
finally the sandbox driver implements

176
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
the blueprint

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,720
that is generated by the main sandbox

178
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,720
components above

179
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,680
here is an example workflow of our

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,280
system

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,400
we first feed the required inputs to the

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,559
sandbox for generating a blueprint

183
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,638
then the sandbox driver outputs an

184
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,039
emulation network based on the blueprint

185
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,120
the output is what we called the mini

186
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,440
internet

187
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,599
in the sandbox users have the freedom to

188
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,479
choose arbitrary node implementations

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,878
for example one can choose quagga or fr

190
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,919
routing for router nodes

191
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
the system provides realistic ip address

192
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
assignments

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,720
at as level and it provides congestion

194
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,280
aware background traffic with the help

195
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
of

196
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
traffic mimickers

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
we evaluated our plc system from two

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
aspects

199
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,440
the correctness of the topology

200
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
generation

201
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,800
and the scalability of network

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,039
instantiation time

203
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,240
machine specifications and software

204
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,520
environments are

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
listed in this slide

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,440
in the correctness test we run a trace

207
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,479
route from

208
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,000
an educational network to a major cloud

209
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,639
provider

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,520
note that all router interface ips are

211
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
populated

212
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,718
by the sandbox automatically as

213
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,159
indicated

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
in the same screenshot

215
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,399
since we did didn't apply any traffic

216
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
control policies on the network

217
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,800
interfaces

218
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,279
there is little delay from hub to hop

219
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,959
if we transfer the router level pass to

220
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,200
s level pass

221
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,000
this level pass can be found on websites

222
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,640
such as bgp view

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
while our chase route results does not

224
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,760
reflect the real world paths

225
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,040
it adds more realism to the experiment

226
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,279
and helps users to run better collateral

227
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,279
damage evaluations in ddos mitigation

228
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
we then run a scalability test to

229
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,680
understand the limit

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,399
of evaluation machines in this figure

231
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,760
we show the relationship of system

232
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,560
instantiation time

233
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,560
and the number of launched routers in a

234
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
single host setting

235
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,479
we find the 3-core machine with 24

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,600
gigabytes of memory can support

237
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,040
around 100 routers before running into

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,920
memory swapping issues meanwhile

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,920
the aws machine was higher memory space

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
continues to follow its linear trend

241
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,880
the sandbox project is an ongoing work

242
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
we are integrating the traffic mimicker

243
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,160
ddos attack

244
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,399
and defense projects into the sandbox

245
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,279
in particular the traffic mimicry

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
implementation

247
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,800
is not a trivial component we ran

248
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
into many design challenges that we did

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,359
not cover

250
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,279
in this short paper to have better

251
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
system scalability

252
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,200
we plan to distribute container nodes

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,279
across a cluster of machines

254
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,440
in order to support for more and hosts

255
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,720
as well as to better network realism

256
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,480
in this plc we used container net as the

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
sandbox driver

258
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
we are considering to use other

259
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
solutions that

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,439
could have better support and system

261
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,760
compatibility

262
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,680
for example one of our paper reviewers

263
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,240
suggested cni projects

264
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,239
and we find them to be quite promising

265
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,040
for managing network interfaces

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,040
in the sandbox

267
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
in conclusion we presented a list of

268
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,319
evaluation missing gaps in ddos research

269
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,040
we introduced the sandbox project a

270
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,279
container based emulation system

271
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,079
the final goal of this project is to

272
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,200
create

273
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,839
a open sourced repository

274
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
well-received attack and defense

275
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,519
projects

276
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,920
and evaluate them in more realistic

277
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
settings

278
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
