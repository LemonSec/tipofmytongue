1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,959
good morning everyone

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,799
i'm sango choi as presenter i'm

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,240
currently working at the afflicted

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,960
institute of actuary

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,759
in republic of korea what i'm going to

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
talk about today

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
is expansion of ics testbed for security

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,759
validation based on mitral tech

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,119
techniques

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,200
let's begin

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,960
i will divide presentation into six

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,960
parts as following contents

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
i'd like to start by asking you a

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,399
question how can we achieve

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,559
continuously monitoring all levels in

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,559
the ics with miter tag framework

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
for this ics environment that allows

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,840
ingesting and analyzing

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,840
various data set to gain security

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
visibility is needed

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
but there are still questions what is

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
the data needed for

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
monitoring where can we get the data

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,720
from

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,520
how can we data be obtained

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,720
of course data obtained from the actual

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,840
operating environment

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
are ideally suited

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
however actual data are difficult to

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,320
obtain

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,080
from ics operating environment going to

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,880
availability

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
even if the data are available a lot of

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,119
information must be deleted

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,119
or modified or into confidentiality

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
existing testbed and dataset mostly

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
include network traffic or

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,119
operation information because attack

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
scenarios typically target a specific

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
area

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,280
when validating and testing security

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,158
systems obtaining attack-related data

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,159
is challenging

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,759
to overcome limitations we focused on

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
three factors

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,800
first we selected monitoring fields to

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
detect security threats

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
that was achieved by analyzing the miter

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,080
tag framework

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
second we expanded high test fit to

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,840
collect and process

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,840
the fields based on the miter tag

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
framework

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
lastly for availability of controllers

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
and data collection periods we consider

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,359
data set enlistment

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
to improve data set scalability in

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
various attack scenarios

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,679
and to modify previously collected data

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
sets

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
this slide outlines the framework to

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
expand

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,280
testbed and dataset containing the

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,599
monitoring fields in our research

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,519
we added attack tools to the produced

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,518
attack scenarios to high test bed

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,518
and also set up battery environment

68
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,200
which is similar to

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,840
high test bed

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,079
we applied port mirroring to the network

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,760
switch of the testbed as a surveillance

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
network traffic

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,359
to forward the mirroring traffic to each

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,519
security appliance

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,840
we deployed on aggregator

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
security monitoring system allows

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,440
ingesting and analyzing various data to

78
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,440
monitor the testbed

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
in addition a data instrument tool dt is

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
proposed

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
to create a data set for simulating

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,720
large scale and long-term

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
attack scenarios

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
let me go over background

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
we built the high test fit implementing

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,480
rear control systems

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
that are widely used in critical

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,280
infrastructure

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
to test the process of individual

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,040
control systems

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,120
feedback is acquired by interacting each

92
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
control system based on the displaced

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
hill simulator

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
high testbed also provides a particular

95
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,040
attack tool that can configure

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
and reproduce possible attack scenarios

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,400
using the process control loop

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,639
as the operation changes

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
the mitotec framework is a threat

100
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
knowledge database

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,440
that contains tactics and techniques

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,199
utilized by attackers

103
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,199
based on real-world observations

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,440
when the mitotec was announced in 2013

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,000
it mainly focused on enterprise

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,000
environments

107
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,639
in the multitask for enterprise tactics

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,199
and techniques were described

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
recently it has been changed because

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,160
techniques have

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
divided into soft techniques to

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,560
specifically describe adversaries

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
behavior

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,479
the mitotec framework has been widely

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
used in several studies

116
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,758
regarding adversary emulation led

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
teaming

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,840
defense gap assessment and so on

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
further the attack framework has been

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,720
continuously expanding

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,719
its domain to industrial control systems

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,880
we classified categories for an event of

123
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,520
interest

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,719
hearing after eoi that is obtained from

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,719
various data sources

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,120
first the network eoi includes network

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,239
traffic information collected using port

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
mirroring or tapping

129
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,239
second the system ui includes event

130
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
information

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,360
generated by systems such as security

132
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,758
appliances

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,680
and network equipment the data also

134
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,720
covers all the information generated

135
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,360
within the host

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
and server

137
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,520
finally the pcq ui include analog and

138
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
data signals that are generated during

139
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,758
the control of field

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,759
devices such as sensors and actuators

141
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,479
in the next section let's take a look at

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,880
the monitoring field for miter tag

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
framework

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
before extracting monitoring field from

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
might attack techniques

146
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
we set the baseline

147
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,960
we targeted mitotec framework for

148
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
enterprise to use elastic detection

149
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,039
rules

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,039
using elastic common schema

151
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,159
with the baseline we firstly arranged 52

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,960
microtech techniques

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,960
used in 92 elastic detection rules

154
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,840
second we classified the data source

155
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
according to the techniques

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
we finally identified the monitoring

157
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,919
field that could be

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,759
extracted from the data source and

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,000
specified additional field

160
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,120
including the collection methods

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
we listed eoi category data source

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
monitoring fields and collection method

163
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,560
according to mitra tag techniques as

164
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,559
shown in the following table

165
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,479
if the mitotic techniques is also used

166
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,880
in ics

167
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,599
the corresponding id is indicated in

168
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
parenthesis

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
the initial monitoring fields are

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
indicated in the italics

171
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,758
and the additional monitoring fields are

172
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,758
represented in board phase text

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,239
as part of lizard here is the example of

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,800
monitoring fields for

175
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,360
t1190 when we want to monitor security

176
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
threats

177
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,880
related to these techniques it can be

178
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,599
seen from the two types of eoi

179
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,319
and 16 monitoring fields through the

180
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
total

181
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,000
of data source should be obtained by

182
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
corresponding methods

183
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
depending on eoi categories there are

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,000
considerations for monitoring fields

185
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
from might attack framework

186
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
because data sources may need target

187
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,479
servers and hosts

188
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,159
other types of system are required to

189
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,159
determine the monitoring fields

190
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
in case of network ui when capturing a

191
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
packet from a server or host

192
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,319
no limitations are imposed on program

193
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
installation

194
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:19,440
controlling insulin a program on an ics

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,440
may be restricted due to availability

196
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,560
so it is necessary to apply port

197
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,879
mirroring on a network switch or typing

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,479
to

199
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
passively capture packets

200
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,279
i'd like to turn to other view that is

201
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,279
target domains

202
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,399
mitotec for ics requires additional data

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
sources

204
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,800
which are not used for attack for

205
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
enterprise

206
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,399
when detecting ics specific techniques

207
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,519
the operational information

208
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,760
must be used as pitch qr data sources

209
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
when selecting monitoring fields from

210
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,519
these data sources

211
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,640
it is possible to detect whether the

212
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,920
information mode

213
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,880
or control logic have been changed

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,360
additionally

215
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,920
schema definition for ps4 data are

216
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,920
required

217
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
now let's move on and introduce how to

218
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,319
expand

219
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
high testbed

220
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,560
we expanded the high test fit with the

221
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,120
aim of

222
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,000
creating a data set containing the

223
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
monitoring fields

224
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,880
based on the analysis of the techniques

225
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,719
of the miter attack framework

226
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,720
we emphasize the key factors

227
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,920
first when the testbed is expanded

228
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,040
information must be collected from

229
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
various data sources

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,880
second data must be collected processed

231
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,880
and stored as a research proposed

232
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,880
furthermore it is possible to search and

233
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,839
analyze the stored information

234
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,760
for security monitoring with

235
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,040
visualization

236
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,519
third a text scenarios considered a full

237
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,160
object chain to handle a data set

238
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,160
including all levels of ics hierarchy

239
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,399
a tool to reproduce the attack scenario

240
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
is also needed

241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,279
finally data must be free of time shift

242
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,760
problems

243
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,640
there can be a time differences between

244
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,880
devices

245
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
such as control systems security

246
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
appliances

247
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
and servers street time synchronization

248
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,519
is

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,640
essential to monitor and analyze for

250
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,640
rear time monitoring

251
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,800
this slide outlines the expanded test

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
fit and flow of eois for monitoring

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
fields

254
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,120
as shown in this slide we have built an

255
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,399
environment for collection

256
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,440
all category of eoi through the expand

257
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,079
high test fit that deflects the four key

258
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
pictures

259
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,359
as i mentioned earlier

260
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,359
we implemented three attack tools that

261
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,399
take into account the

262
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,480
eoi categories

263
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,680
through the physical tag 2 corresponding

264
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,720
to control systems

265
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
level 0 and 1 included in the high test

266
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
bed

267
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,680
we implemented 14 single attacks

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
targeting a single particular point

269
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,199
and 19 sophisticated attacks targeting

270
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,519
multiple fiscal points

271
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,440
we installed axia's excluder tab to

272
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,920
generate malicious network traffic

273
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
based on non-vulnerability between level

274
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
1 and

275
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,680
2 in ics

276
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,680
this tool reproduces the attack

277
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,680
situation through packet crafting

278
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,199
in addition it reproduces denial of

279
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
service

280
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,680
and distributed denial of service

281
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
attacks

282
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,319
using the proper team attack automation

283
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,160
we built a system-based attack

284
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,560
environment for level 2.

285
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
this attack tool is a post module of

286
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:10,160
metaspray that reproduce

287
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,800
the technique of miter tech framework

288
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,959
a direct attack on assets in the testbed

289
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,839
during the operation to create data sets

290
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,199
can affect

291
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
testbed availability

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,319
additionally if attack traffic is

293
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
directly injected into the operating and

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
management

295
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,519
systems such as the operating

296
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,000
organization problems may occur in the

297
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,000
system

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,839
recovery to the situation before the

299
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,760
attack

300
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,720
is also considered

301
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,480
to resolve these problems we built an xc

302
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,320
based hypervisor server

303
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
to form a virtual environment

304
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,519
a mature environment is physically

305
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,920
separated from the high test bed

306
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,480
and similar to the existing operating

307
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,479
environment

308
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,360
we installed bit at the virtual host to

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,959
deliver various data sources to the

310
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
security monitoring system

311
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,518
based on the lizards of the mitral tag

312
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,518
analysis

313
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,839
we deployed an aggregator capable of

314
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,479
traffic integration

315
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,560
replication and distribution to forward

316
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,120
the traffic received from each network

317
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
switch

318
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,560
to each security appliance

319
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
when the mirror traffic was delivered to

320
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,639
the aggregator

321
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
the network traffic was simultaneously

322
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,839
forwarded to each security appliances

323
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,319
via traffic integration and

324
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,199
application we built

325
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,519
five commercial security appliances and

326
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
two

327
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,880
widely used open source network internet

328
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,160
detection system

329
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
salt and circuited

330
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,119
reconfigured whitelist basic rules

331
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,000
according to the ip addresses

332
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,760
of assets in the testbed in addition we

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,519
applied signature based rules

334
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,519
provided by each appliances

335
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,760
we activated the logo functions at the

336
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,479
appliances

337
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,760
to generate an eoi and report it to the

338
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
security monitoring system

339
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
in case of five commercial appliances

340
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,120
the eoi

341
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,560
is collected via the others provide the

342
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,560
content of log files

343
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,880
the security monitoring system includes

344
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,079
a collection module for gathering

345
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,040
monitoring fields

346
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,880
from various data sources and a process

347
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,079
module for normalizing the different

348
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,639
field types

349
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,638
in a command structure via the ecs

350
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,000
furthermore last search and kivana were

351
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,480
used for storing the process data

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,880
and for current and visualizing stored

353
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
data

354
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
although we built up expanded high test

355
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,079
bed it still remains

356
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,160
challenging to simulate or ics sites

357
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,560
with a test bed alone

358
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,639
specific scenarios are required that we

359
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
repeatedly change the settings

360
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,880
of the virtual environment and attack

361
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,279
tools

362
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,800
besides the sophisticated cyber text

363
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,760
targeting ics

364
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,760
called apt consume a long period of time

365
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,119
to overcome these problems we

366
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,040
implemented the data enlistment tool

367
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,040
dt as shown in this slide

368
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:33,120
dt consists of two modules that are eoi

369
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,119
augmentation and time augmentation

370
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
the eoi augmentation module virtually as

371
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
assets on the testbed for the data

372
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,319
dataset enrichment

373
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,320
and generates potential eoi

374
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,599
the time multiplication module inflates

375
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
the existing expanded high testbed data

376
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,959
set

377
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,880
according to the time it will reflect

378
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,399
the characteristic of the apt

379
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,399
over a long period of time

380
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,079
in conclusion we introduced a method to

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,639
expand the existing testbed

382
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,439
so that information can be collected and

383
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,160
monitored

384
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,959
during an ics attack based on the miter

385
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,959
tag framework

386
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,680
to overcome the limitation of data sets

387
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,240
collected in the testbed

388
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,758
we are developing tool to transform and

389
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,000
extend the data sets

390
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,279
obtained from the testbed according to

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,279
different user scenarios

392
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,240
in our future work we intend to develop

393
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
a data set including information from

394
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,240
various data sources

395
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,000
that can be used for security monitoring

396
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
according to the attack scenarios in

397
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,959
icss

398
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,160
