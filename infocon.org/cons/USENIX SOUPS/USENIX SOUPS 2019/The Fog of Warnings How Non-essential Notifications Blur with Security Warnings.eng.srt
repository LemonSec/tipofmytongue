1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,480
I'm Tony Vance I'm from Temple

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,670
University and I'm happy to present this

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,760
work on behalf of my co-authors at UC

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,860
Boulder and Brigham Young University and

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,529
together we are members of the neural

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,860
security lab and we study security and

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,729
privacy issues using tools and knowledge

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,199
from the field of neuroscience now first

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,390
I want to show you these two images and

10
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:42,690
I want to test you which of these two is

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,920
a security message technically only one

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,320
is although you might argue that a

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,820
notice to install Java might also be a

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,059
security message so maybe that's a trick

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,860
question but only one of these is and

16
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,669
yet both messages have a very similar

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,720
look and feel and the danger is

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,479
referencing the title of this paper the

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,089
fog of warnings is that you might see

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,010
notifications that are harmless benign

21
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,010
but you see many of them and you might

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,110
habituate to those notifications and

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,990
then the threat is of that habituation

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,869
might carry or bleed over to rare

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,850
security messages so I thought about

26
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:29,939
this when I noticed my two-year-old son

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:31,380
using an iPad so there's no sound there

28
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,520
but you can see that he just

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,710
automatically dismissed that message and

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,740
I think part of the problem here is we

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,079
have user design guidelines published

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,908
from major software companies like Apple

33
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,119
like Microsoft and others that

34
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,149
explicitly train developers to make all

35
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,929
user interface design elements visually

36
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,640
similar and consistent and yet in the

37
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:59,280
realm of security and privacy that can

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,780
have I'm arguing detrimental effects and

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,189
I'm not the only one to make this

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,939
argument we've had arguments like this

41
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:09,239
in the past this is from C ACM over 10

42
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:13,920
years ago where this observation the

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,630
same observation was was made and this

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
author West says that security messages

45
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,120
often resemble other message dialogues

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,489
and as a result security messages may

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,569
not stand out in importance and users

48
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,640
often learn to disk

49
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,018
regard them and we've seen this with

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
other studies other studies have made

51
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:33,090
this argument in this case looking at

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,828
EULA's and their argument is that people

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,200
are just trained to dismiss EULA's and

54
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,819
that trained behavior might carry over

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,138
to other things like security messages

56
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,189
but again these two papers are

57
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,920
conceptual they don't actually

58
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,099
empirically test this and then we have

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,399
empirical papers like this one by Serge

60
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,738
Eagleman and Laura Craner who noticed

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,290
that in their study of phishing warnings

62
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,569
that some people disregarded particular

63
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,519
phishing warnings because they mistook

64
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,679
those warnings for a previous warning

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,659
they had seen and so they mistake they

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,219
arrived at a wrong conclusion that they

67
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,510
could safely ignore those phishing

68
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,269
warnings so again that's very

69
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,189
interesting observation but that was an

70
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,409
incidental observation wasn't the focus

71
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,078
of the study and so what we set out to

72
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,078
do in this study is to explicitly look

73
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,900
at the question can people habituate to

74
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,930
notifications and can that habituation

75
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:29,009
carry over to a new context specifically

76
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,269
rare security messages so habituation

77
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,659
has been study for a long time and

78
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,060
usable security community but it's been

79
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,939
studied even longer in neuropsychology

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,549
over a hundred years and the definition

81
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,459
in this space in this field is decreased

82
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:47,849
response to repeated stimulation and

83
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,979
it's observed in all animal life even

84
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,709
simple organisms like the California sea

85
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,199
slug and it's been observed observed in

86
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,479
the human brain and in our previous work

87
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,400
we've shown that people habituated to

88
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,889
security messages and it's very clear

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,970
from neural activity in the brain just

90
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,889
after a few exposures people habituate

91
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,379
to security messages you only have a few

92
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,799
chances to get people's full attention

93
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:16,228
to a unique unseen message but here's

94
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,930
the rub again so what if your security

95
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,000
message is not unique but even though

96
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,520
you've only shown it once and that's

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,860
because a user has situated two security

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,169
Northerners two notifications that have

99
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,919
nothing to do with security in other

100
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:34,620
context and again back to

101
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:38,159
neuropsychology this this phenomenon is

102
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,050
called generalization of habituation

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,480
in fact in this seminal paper from the

104
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,180
60s these authors outlined nine

105
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,060
characteristics of habituation and one

106
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,550
of these they call generalization it

107
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,820
means that habituation to one response

108
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,910
or response to one stimulus carries over

109
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,640
to other stimuli that share some

110
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,980
similarities so our research question is

111
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,680
does a pigeon tune on security related

112
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,770
notifications generalize to security

113
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,790
warnings and does the degree of

114
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,250
look-and-feel

115
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:19,770
similarity influence the amount of

116
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:21,390
generalization of habituation okay so

117
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,240
again we're drawing on habituation

118
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,590
theory and its really simple works like

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,900
this a person encounters a stimulus and

120
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,140
a mental model is created to represent

121
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,229
that stimulus and the next time a

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,030
similar stimulus is encountered it's

123
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,300
compared to the mental model and if it

124
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,520
matches then habituation increases and

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,460
whatever response will be made will be

126
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,359
inhibited and eventually you'll see a

127
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,640
lack or a decreased response and on the

128
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,160
other hand if you encounter a stimulus

129
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,590
that doesn't match your mental model

130
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,710
then you will mentally amend your model

131
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:05,479
and then you will become sensitized to

132
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:08,250
the stimulus and the response will be

133
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,230
well the inhibition will be released and

134
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,630
so that behavior will be will increase

135
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,760
the response will increase and this is

136
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,340
the basic framework are working from to

137
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,469
look at this problem so with our our

138
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,000
method we used was an online field

139
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,470
experiment so there's nothing neuro in

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,419
this next part although there is

141
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,960
something that that follows at the end

142
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:31,950
and in this online experiment we used

143
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,969
the Firefox browser with Mechanical Turk

144
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,479
so we had people's own browsers at home

145
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:42,390
doing whatever wherever they do it and

146
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,010
we had over 600 participants and in this

147
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,490
experimental task we use something we've

148
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,900
used in our past studies we tell the

149
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,020
subjects that we would like you to

150
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,758
classify images whether those images

151
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:59,490
our photographs or drawings of Batman

152
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,800
just to keep it interesting so in this

153
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,030
case they'd say this is an image and if

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,849
they do this they get a performance

155
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,580
indicator after every single

156
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:10,020
classification so it looks like this

157
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,758
there's a progress bar they have 10

158
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,859
seconds to classify this if they

159
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,409
successfully classify all the images

160
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,639
they receive a bonus on top of the the

161
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:21,060
money that we pay them to do this

162
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,860
experiment but in addition to this this

163
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,479
notification this performance

164
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,330
notification that tells them how well

165
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,210
they're doing we also give them we mix

166
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,300
in these security messages so one of

167
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,299
them is as a privacy permission

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,940
notification in this case location will

169
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,460
you allow us to allow to select your

170
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,469
your current location and this is by

171
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,448
design very similar to the notification

172
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,830
that performance notification that we

173
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,199
give them and then we have some

174
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,389
notifications that are less visually

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,930
similar like an extension message which

176
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:56,759
is a little bit bigger so in this case

177
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,560
this is mixed in with these other

178
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,090
notifications what's what's interesting

179
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,810
about this design is that we tell them

180
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,698
this is an iframe and inside this iframe

181
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,069
you're going to be automatically taught

182
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,750
brought to random sites around the web

183
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:13,800
and we don't have control over what

184
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:17,180
sites you visit and so if those sites

185
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,430
prompt you to do something that's not us

186
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,349
we tested for realism and and they

187
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,880
believed quantitatively and also

188
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,289
qualitatively when we talked to them

189
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,509
that this was the case that they were

190
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:29,340
being brought all over the web to look

191
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,349
at images so it sounds really scary but

192
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,159
again we've restricted them to batman

193
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:38,968
images so this design is we showed them

194
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,919
15 performance notifications and we

195
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,380
compared that to showing a security

196
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,480
message at the 15th position at the very

197
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,930
end after they've become habituated to

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,490
this performance notification and also

199
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,349
comparing a security message at the very

200
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,680
first position before they see any

201
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,730
performance notifications and that Delta

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,910
the difference between these two

203
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,850
conditions is partial evidence of

204
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,050
generalization and then we had some

205
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,470
other warnings that don't look similar

206
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,630
at all to those

207
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,780
those performance notifications but you

208
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,660
do see in Firefox like a request to

209
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:17,350
download a binary file and a request to

210
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,850
open a macro enabled spreadsheet and if

211
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,690
you got one of these messages from a

212
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,810
random website you encounter on the web

213
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,880
hopefully you wouldn't click on these so

214
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,619
this one looks like in the task so we're

215
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,060
really testing for two things here one

216
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,090
is does generalization happen and second

217
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,959
does the similarity of those warnings

218
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,560
affect the extent to which

219
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,620
generalization happens but we also

220
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,199
wanted to rule out fatigue and in the

221
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,350
warning literature sometimes habituation

222
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,720
is is anonymously used with the term

223
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,150
warning fatigue but they're not the same

224
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,710
in fact a neurobiology they're

225
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,319
definitely not the same in fact one of

226
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,840
the tests of genitive habituation

227
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,450
happening is if you rule out the

228
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,070
possibility of fatigue if someone have

229
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,670
 weights to something and they're

230
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,480
not tired

231
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,930
then that's definitely habituation so as

232
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,660
an example here let's say I show this

233
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,670
stimulus at the very first exposure you

234
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,790
might have attention that's relatively

235
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,800
high on this y-axis and over time you

236
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,140
would see this classic J curve this

237
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,300
represents habituation over time it will

238
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,970
devote less and less attention to that

239
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,209
particular stimulus and if I show you a

240
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,550
new stimulus then attention should go up

241
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:40,210
to where it was the beginning of this of

242
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:42,550
his task if generalization is happening

243
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,410
if these two stimuli are similar then

244
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,170
that attention won't be near the top

245
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,079
it'll be somewhere down below and that

246
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,150
difference between where attention was

247
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,390
in the beginning and where that new

248
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,819
stimulus is that's generalization we can

249
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,500
measure that difference but this alone

250
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,450
doesn't tell you anything about fatigue

251
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,540
so the is a possibility that sounds just

252
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,089
tired well that's when you bring in a

253
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,740
foil a really novel stimulus that looks

254
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:12,130
nothing like the others this in this

255
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,320
case represented by a rubber duck and if

256
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,750
you can see that one attention that

257
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,780
rubber duck is high like the the first

258
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,660
stimulus was in the beginning and at the

259
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,220
same time you see gentlemen

260
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,480
generalization to this other effect then

261
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,910
that's really strong evidence that

262
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
generalization is happening so we also

263
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,420
had a foil in our case and we also used

264
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,400
a rubber duck and one of my colleagues

265
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,620
is from to my colleagues from Pittsburgh

266
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,300
this is a sub jaii intrepid duck that

267
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,310
was shown there it looked a random

268
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,689
enough to show to people just to make

269
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,670
sure was different from everything else

270
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,710
they were seeing this experiment and we

271
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,000
measured fatigue we showed this foil at

272
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,220
the very beginning of the task and

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,320
compared this at the very end of the

274
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:55,320
task all right so we had 10 fully

275
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
crossed conditions and our dependent

276
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,030
variables were habituation and we

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,490
measure this in two ways one we used

278
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,800
mouse cursor tracking to see how quickly

279
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,560
people moused to the warnings or

280
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,599
notifications to dismiss them and in our

281
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,219
previous research we found that this

282
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,760
mouse cursor tracking is actually a

283
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,920
really reliable proxy for what people

284
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,110
how people have pitch weight in the

285
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,729
brain so you don't have to have really

286
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,520
expensive MRI scanner if you use

287
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,580
something like mouse cursor tracking you

288
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,480
can deploy this outside the lab at scale

289
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,010
and it works just about as well and we

290
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,250
also use response time just how quickly

291
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,770
they clicked and we also used warning

292
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,960
adherence or in this case click-through

293
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:44,130
rates so how at what rate were they

294
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:48,330
ignoring these warnings so here's our

295
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:53,550
first results image and this figure you

296
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:55,080
can see mouse cursor reaction times how

297
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,810
quickly they're moving the mouse and in

298
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,330
red you see a classic J curve along the

299
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,329
bottom where at first people responded

300
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,610
relatively slowly but as each exposure

301
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,780
increased they got faster and faster and

302
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:12,960
it kind of bottoms out towards the end

303
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:15,300
after 15 exposures it's pretty much flat

304
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,340
that line and then on top of that we

305
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,800
show a security message at the beginning

306
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,610
at the fifth first position at the end

307
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,579
the last position the 15th position and

308
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,040
in each case reaction times increased

309
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,220
from the fifth from the first the very

310
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,469
last position

311
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,150
and especially so for those warnings

312
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,030
that looked similar to the performance

313
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,920
message at the same time if just

314
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,530
measuring reaction speed this is just

315
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,319
how quickly they're responding this

316
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,839
speed measured in how many pixels they

317
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,880
traversed that went up so their speed

318
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,620
increased from the first position to the

319
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,850
last position and you'd expect all this

320
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,860
and then finally the warning behavior

321
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,810
the actual adherence this increased as

322
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,180
well so the click-through rate was much

323
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,579
higher at the 15th position compared to

324
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,800
the first position and across all of

325
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,180
this that foil condition that had

326
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,370
nothing to do with the other warnings

327
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,439
that didn't looked the same that speed

328
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,050
did not increase and the click-through

329
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,570
rate for that message did not increase

330
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,310
so that effectively rules out the

331
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,650
possibility that people were just tired

332
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,430
of these messages after 15 exposures to

333
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:27,490
them all right so some takeaways so

334
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,079
first of all we found that habituation

335
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,990
to notifications that don't have

336
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,970
anything to do with security or privacy

337
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:41,260
that they can generalize to security

338
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:43,720
messages and we also found that the

339
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,000
difference in responding is is not due

340
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,920
to fatigue it's it's due to this effect

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,950
called generalization that it actually

342
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,140
does carry over we found that the closer

343
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,030
the similarity the greater the

344
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,400
generalization and that's why those

345
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,829
those messages that look a lot like the

346
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,890
performance notification that people

347
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,420
generalize them most to those even

348
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:08,980
though they had only seen them once in

349
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,630
this task and so the overall implication

350
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,940
is that we should be designing security

351
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:16,060
messages to be visually distinct and you

352
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,550
might think well that's not that

353
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,369
surprising and yet when we look at our

354
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,540
user interface design guidelines we

355
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,860
don't see that we don't see that

356
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,750
recommendation and we don't see it in

357
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,570
software that very often security

358
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,130
messages look a lot like notifications

359
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,870
that people see on a regular basis

360
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,370
either on their computers or on their

361
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,440
mobile devices so we also looked since

362
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,180
the publication of this paper we looked

363
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,810
at a couple other questions in this case

364
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,319
we looked at this

365
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,579
in the lab for example for the program

366
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,710
committee if some of the feedback we got

367
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,780
on this paper was that well there's

368
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,250
another rival explanation maybe people

369
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,560
in this task are just really engrossed

370
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,690
they're so into it that they are

371
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,280
responding to these messages more

372
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:02,540
quickly so we did an MRI study to see

373
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,040
well is there evidence of this

374
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,010
generalization happening in the brain

375
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,770
and the other thing we looked at is not

376
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,870
just do does generalization happen when

377
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,819
the look and feel is the same but in

378
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,980
this case we looked at the question well

379
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,970
can we make generalization happen less

380
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,470
if we changed the mode of interaction

381
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:25,280
change it from what I call click to

382
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:29,900
dismiss so we performed an fMRI

383
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,610
experiment and in addition to the the

384
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,590
stimuli I showed you before these are

385
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,880
three new ones or two new ones one of

386
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,800
them you actually have to drag the

387
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,770
cursor from one side of the other in

388
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,439
order to either accept or dismiss a

389
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:45,590
message and in another you have to swipe

390
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,880
across this so these are two different

391
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,500
modes of interaction they're not

392
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
difficult to do but they're just

393
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,270
different they're different from mousing

394
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,400
over and clicking okay first of all we

395
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,290
found generalization in the brain or

396
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,030
HIPPA habituation the brain and visual

397
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,110
processing centers which makes sense

398
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,760
because they're looking at visual

399
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,250
stimuli and this is this helps to rule

400
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,379
out the possibility of someone being

401
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,119
just engrossed in the task because if

402
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,900
someone is very engrossed in the task

403
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,819
you would see more neural activation not

404
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,910
less over time again you see kind of

405
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,530
this J curve that there's just less

406
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:25,339
processing in the brain individual

407
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:27,649
processing centers over time and this is

408
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,280
also interesting we see that there is

409
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,870
more generalization for those security

410
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,970
messages that share the same mode of

411
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,189
interaction which is click to dismiss

412
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,570
compared to those messages where you

413
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,430
have to do something that's different or

414
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,060
out of the norm like dragging and

415
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:46,910
dropping or swiping and just that very

416
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,310
very simple change even though it

417
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,810
doesn't really slow down the users

418
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,879
workflow it actually does make a

419
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,909
significant difference in the amount of

420
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,680
generalization that occurs

421
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,440
so again this is another example I think

422
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,990
of how our brains sometimes work against

423
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,220
us in making security decisions and we

424
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,850
can make it a lot easier for our users

425
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,700
if we clearly call out privacy messages

426
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,379
and security messages so that they stand

427
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,770
out so that generalization doesn't

428
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:30,770
happen and I appreciate your attention

429
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:32,900
thank you I question about

430
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,520
distinguishing like privacy and security

431
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,130
messages

432
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,310
isn't there a challenge because so many

433
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,160
of the decisions that software chooses

434
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,810
to present to you have a privacy and

435
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,120
security implication I think your first

436
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,190
example was a really good one right you

437
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,020
classified the that do you want to

438
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,540
install Java as a less security impact

439
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,530
choice but it's still potentially

440
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,970
significant and if you're using a lot of

441
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,740
websites a lot of the questions that

442
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,410
they want to ask you where they want you

443
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,630
to make a choice is because there is a

444
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,900
privacy trade-off there is a security

445
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,930
trade-off so obviously a synthetic

446
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,660
example of a notification about whether

447
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,240
you correctly classify Batman is perhaps

448
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,310
unrealistic but other are there

449
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,410
obviously things that should have a

450
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,300
notification that you need to take an

451
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,970
action on where the action is completely

452
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,340
insignificant and doesn't require

453
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,870
different treatment sure so you make a

454
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,760
good point I would agree with you that a

455
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,250
lot of the notifications we see have a

456
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,720
privacy or security implication but

457
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,940
there are plenty notifications that

458
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,560
don't like for example text message

459
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,330
notifications on our phones we get them

460
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,429
constantly throughout the day they

461
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,669
interrupt us constantly and we're just

462
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:51,170
kind of trained to to ignore it and go

463
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,390
back to work or to look at it and go

464
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,900
back to work so that's just one example

465
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,030
but mobile devices are I don't want to

466
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,150
use the word notorious but there we go I

467
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,889
just did so they they present tons of

468
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,700
messages all the time and our computers

469
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,210
do too so I so I agree with you to an

470
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,040
extent

471
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,890
I think that the number of notifications

472
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,780
that don't have anything to do with

473
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,990
security or privacy or actually are

474
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,330
actually much greater does habituation

475
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,610
still apply when there's no action that

476
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,889
needs to be taken on the notification so

477
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,429
in your example you needed to click a

478
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,330
blue or white button to dismiss the

479
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,400
informational notification you're sort

480
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,199
of now comparing with like a text

481
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,640
message notification sure you could

482
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,950
choose to reply it but the normal action

483
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,570
is you read and then you're done with it

484
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,950
rather than now make a choice do you

485
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,040
want to install Java or not do you want

486
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,040
to give access to it does it continue

487
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,570
across that threshold even if there's no

488
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,860
decision-making required for that for

489
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,899
instance text message ones which i think

490
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,219
is a great comparison that's a really

491
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,080
good question we didn't look at that in

492
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,580
this study and this is the first study

493
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,139
we've done to look at this problem

494
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,820
another one would be what about

495
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,100
notifications that don't require user

496
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,080
interaction what about notifications on

497
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,169
different devices do they cross over

498
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,850
from one device to another I think those

499
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,370
are really good empirical questions that

500
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,260
we want to look at thank you very much

501
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:18,080
thank you so we have time for one more

502
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:19,190
quick question my name is Kevin left one

503
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,020
of the things that I thought was really

504
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,490
interesting following on that about the

505
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,100
difference between the real-world

506
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,090
examples that you showed and your

507
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,469
examples from your study was that the

508
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,860
real-world examples both of them even

509
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,480
the Java one the default was to failsafe

510
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,520
default was to not install Java whereas

511
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,890
in your studies examples the default was

512
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,520
the unsafe behavior did you look at all

513
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,320
at how like the effect of changing the

514
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,810
default even just the highlight on the

515
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,189
buttons in your study that's another

516
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,020
really good question and the answer is

517
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,060
no we did this that's something we want

518
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,129
to look at in future studies and this

519
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,840
study was more like the baseline can we

520
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,780
can you observe it can we see it

521
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,760
happening and secondly can we change can

522
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,950
we affect it by changing up the look and

523
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,629
feel and a mode of interaction but

524
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,210
that's a really good point I'm glad that

525
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:08,110
in many cases notifications have a safe

526
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,110
fail option
