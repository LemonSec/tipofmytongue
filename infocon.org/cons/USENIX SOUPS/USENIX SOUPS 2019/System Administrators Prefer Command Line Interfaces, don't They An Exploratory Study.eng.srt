1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,240
so today I'm going to be talking about

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,970
some work that I did my colleagues in

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,550
Towson University in Sweden and we want

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,349
to go into the following questions do

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,939
season's traders prefer command-line

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,700
interfaces don't they and to answer this

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,460
question we went through like a sport or

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,290
study using firewall interfaces if I

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,600
don't have much time of really want to

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,670
go to the toilet and you want to just a

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,130
summary of the what's the answer for

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,620
this question the answer is no they

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,960
don't prefer command-line interfaces

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,970
even though there's a lot of like

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,060
evidence or a lot of prejudice that

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,280
tells us that what they really like is a

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,350
common line interface and why you think

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,260
that because I have this as you seen

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,090
yesterday when people have this mental

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,430
model or like this idea what a seasoned

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,769
inspector is if someone's sitting in

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,610
front of a black screen just type in

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,290
things non-stop and that's actually what

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,030
you want to look at they won't want to

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,829
investigate so before we start I would

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,749
like to tell you how actually came with

27
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,639
this with this study we like this paper

28
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:26,039
what we knew before what was this what

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,630
is the state of the art is what we have

30
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:32,219
seen from the last past ten years that

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,229
all the papers that have around like

32
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,649
seasons traitors are the word date ID or

33
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,170
didn't security experts they actually

34
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:42,299
tell us that they prefer common line

35
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,159
interfaces and that's the way that have

36
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,009
been worked there whether they work and

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,069
that's what they want even like there

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,920
are some one of the main papers that

39
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:55,200
actually then studied like 106 traitors

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,659
in the past like 10 years ago they got

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,979
some quite starkey so quite strong

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,049
evidence that actually they don't like

43
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,780
it people who even wrote like we don't

44
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,579
want no more please stop that this is

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,288
like we like common line interface like

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,870
the type but from what we see or what

47
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,670
you hear when a talk when you look at

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,390
like far what we have around our

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,730
firewalls

50
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,319
every major vendor has a graphical user

51
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,379
interface

52
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,890
some of them is even difficult to fix of

53
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:29,880
go to

54
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:33,279
they wear the CL Isis when I talked to

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,290
we did a user study on interface and

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,270
found there like quite many none of them

57
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,820
was tested so there's a lot of like

58
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,680
things that were still missing but there

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,940
was a train that went to investigate and

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,430
to do that we actually decided to ask

61
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,980
herself like this put them to research

62
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,410
question in front of us the first one

63
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,649
was what file interfaces do C's

64
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,510
instructors use and actually what fire

65
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,190
interface do they prefer because that'd

66
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,019
be a difference they could by using

67
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,050
something but they prefer something else

68
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,000
could be that oh I like CLI but I can

69
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,430
only have with or like which I don't

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,330
have with so that's what we want to

71
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,489
investigate and to investigate that this

72
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,860
is what we did is there out basically

73
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,410
the outline of this presentation we did

74
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,150
an online survey and we did the one last

75
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,010
survey what actually collected like the

76
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,830
answer of 306 traitors went to see

77
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,870
actually how actually do that then we

78
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,470
did some data noise both quantitative

79
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,200
and qualitative and in the end after the

80
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,060
collector results analyze that look at

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,160
what we have we came out some design

82
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,430
recommendations so how actually can move

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,590
forward to make the were consciousness

84
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,570
traitors like it or special friends much

85
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,350
better much easier or what are you

86
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:53,049
looking for what I expecting from us

87
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:56,079
let's start with the online survey so

88
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,120
they are online survey as we probably

89
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,880
know from the presentation that have

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,090
seen is pretty difficult to find or to

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,380
capture like sickness traitors to answer

92
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,420
something especially the ones that are

93
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,400
security experts they usually don't like

94
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,488
to answer those they think is a waste of

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,700
time so try to keep out to get something

96
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,220
that we really easy and fast for them to

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,140
answer so come with like some question

98
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,940
that is based on skip logic so depending

99
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,650
on how actually they go into the answer

100
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,570
the previous question they that decides

101
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,859
where they go into the questionnaire so

102
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,490
did something that would be like quite

103
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,200
short only between 11 and 14 questions

104
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,169
so they have at most 14 questions to

105
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,539
answer four of them open-ended and it

106
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,719
basically asked them how much time they

107
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,440
wore

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,240
of Pharos per day liked or per week

109
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,400
which interface they mainly used and

110
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,430
which interface actually they prefer to

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,710
one they prefer to use which tasks were

112
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,080
easier which e with each interface or

113
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,820
they use one is that they like to use

114
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,500
what is something else that's like it

115
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,930
better to use for this type of specific

116
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,610
tasks and what are these kinds of

117
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,220
limitations of each of those interfaces

118
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,050
and not end up on the second part

119
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,120
questionnaire of like for questions on

120
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,300
demographics just to find out how much

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,950
experience they have and so on in a

122
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,350
sense to keep the questionnaire short

123
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,219
exceeded because in a sense that they

124
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,500
took at most or an average under three

125
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,160
minutes to answer the questionnaire and

126
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,310
the median was a bit or something around

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,710
two and a half minutes so it was very

128
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:35,200
short and the retention rate or the

129
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:38,919
completion rate that have was around 59%

130
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,229
so out of like oh everyone that started

131
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,390
like out of ten that started around six

132
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:47,770
would complete your questionnaire so or

133
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:49,810
survey so that was quite nice so how

134
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,729
actually recruit people and actually how

135
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,520
actually you got like a high number

136
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,400
participants actually to join or like to

137
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,229
answer this first of all went looking

138
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,950
for season stretchers that volunteers

139
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,789
and ask for volunteers they're like

140
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,070
there's no financial compensation

141
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,690
they're getting nothing but of course

142
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,520
when you want to give a compensation to

143
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,740
fund the system straight or that already

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,070
probably has a good salary you probably

145
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,800
cannot pay that much so they are like

146
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,440
extremely hard to recruit so to find

147
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,180
them we went to like the regular waste

148
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,870
from look and there sees no straighter

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:29,770
forums email list and we got a bit of

150
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,620
pick up there but when finally managed

151
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,200
to posts or survey honest very

152
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,470
specialized subreddit this is a means to

153
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,909
bread it we got something like more than

154
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,860
eighty percent of participants over

155
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,789
there so that was where you got our

156
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,470
success it was they have their policies

157
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:50,950
over the usually don't take service into

158
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,360
theirs into their subreddit but then we

159
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,219
had

160
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,210
question them when their trust and

161
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,949
eventually they allow us to post your

162
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,688
questions there and you're not just

163
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,120
looking for any season straighter we're

164
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:07,050
looking for administrators that have

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,210
worked or work with pharaohs so this is

166
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,099
a also specific subset of season

167
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,479
straighter so those very specialized

168
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:18,419
people with security expertise in this

169
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,860
subreddit they're like 360,000 people

170
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:25,080
that subscribe to that work accounts and

171
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:30,990
on a daily basis they're like 3,000

172
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:36,349
people that are online at any time so

173
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:38,729
with like this 300 400 participants we

174
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,349
collect the data and I'm going to

175
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,659
present first layer the demographics

176
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,240
that we collect from them and first of

177
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,819
all the age distribution so the age

178
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,830
distribution actually follows what

179
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:55,979
expect around reddit users so they're

180
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:59,128
mostly young so around 80 percent of

181
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,669
participants were like between 25 and 44

182
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:04,259
years old

183
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:06,659
so 44 is still very young and gender

184
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,150
distribution is like mostly male but

185
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:11,279
that's also close to what a seeing on

186
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,830
this particular subreddit where around

187
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:19,669
like 93 percent or ninety four percent

188
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:22,318
are males so that's what we got there

189
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,479
the second part of my graph is how much

190
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,779
time they spent working on Fair Oaks and

191
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,849
that was quite a surprise that more than

192
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,250
70 percent spent between one hour and

193
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,809
one and four hours or less than one hour

194
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,578
to four hours actually managing

195
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,890
fireworks on their daily work so it

196
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:40,559
means that like it sees this or it is

197
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,019
not their main activity that they do so

198
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,319
they spend some time around the week but

199
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,230
that's not majority time they spend and

200
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,390
when as was experience seasons traitors

201
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,870
we got a lot of people like more than 10

202
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,760
years or like most of them or more than

203
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,690
75 percent or 80 percent of them have

204
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
like this more than four years

205
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,680
experience working ceaseless traitors so

206
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,750
people that have been work for quite

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,899
some time and finally on the mark of

208
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,610
demographics

209
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,559
when asked how good they were like with

210
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,339
managing their firewalls or working the

211
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:15,189
fire rose almost them claimed to be at

212
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:19,809
to be either advanced or experts on

213
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:22,059
using Pharaohs goods for the mud would

214
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,769
size a sizable number of them says I

215
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,199
have intermittent acknowledge and just a

216
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:30,209
few actually say that or just basic

217
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:32,709
knowledge but if you look at the main

218
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:36,359
questions that to ask what they prefer

219
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:42,729
what they use then this is what we got

220
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:48,850
so if you look at the interface that

221
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:51,069
they use most then 70% of them around

222
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,529
70% of them used like mostly graphical

223
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:56,079
user interfaces on their daily work so

224
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,329
that's what they use and what was quite

225
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,660
a surprise for us maybe not because like

226
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,339
there's so many graphical user interface

227
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,819
their own but when you asked about what

228
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:09,519
they preferred then what they prefer

229
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:11,170
actually I'm also almost 60 percent of

230
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,480
them actually prefer to use graphical

231
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,399
interface and not CLI which it goes

232
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,980
against all the prejudice that you have

233
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,470
on what a cisnet crater looks like or

234
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,370
does on their daily life and the

235
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,699
preference for CLI is basically close to

236
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,790
half of that so thirty percent or three

237
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:32,620
out of them actually prefer to use to

238
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,379
prefer to CLI stead of graphical user

239
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:40,059
interfaces so they're like the I say the

240
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:43,300
what we found out of out of our data

241
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:45,100
that you collect we also remember to ask

242
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,258
like these four questions is open-ended

243
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,990
questions that we collected all their

244
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:52,120
answers you code them and then it come

245
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,730
out of like what they think what's good

246
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,379
about the CLI what's bad about CLI good

247
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,449
about the graphical user interfaces and

248
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,629
bad about the graphical user interfaces

249
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:04,118
so what the numbers that I have under

250
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,350
the the inside the circles is the number

251
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:08,110
of coding have friends that have for

252
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,439
each so when asked them what actually

253
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,740
was good force he got a CLI so why use

254
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:16,449
if you like a CLI user why do you think

255
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,800
it's good for doing that and what use

256
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,949
that for

257
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,890
so most of them actually praised the

258
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,020
flexibility and how flexible is a CLI

259
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,140
and how efficient it is to use so for

260
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,050
instance some of them actually said it

261
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,240
has a very high signal-to-noise ratio

262
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,089
and therefore they prefer that than

263
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,120
anything else so since it's like there's

264
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:43,060
no clutter they can do they have freedom

265
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,980
to do whatever they want and also one

266
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,609
thing that you saw quite that appear

267
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,230
quite many times is that all the

268
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,760
functionality is there there's nothing

269
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,190
there's hundred-percent covers

270
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,530
everything that if I won't do so that's

271
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,780
supported by the kernel or the OS and

272
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,370
GUI is actually don't do that they mask

273
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:07,449
a lot of things that they cannot

274
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:09,880
actually get to use so but what was the

275
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,560
bad things about CLI so was that so if

276
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,410
selai has good things they also has bad

277
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,459
things and what was bad according to

278
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:20,410
them is that CL eyes may be scary or

279
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,120
overwhelming for a beginner train user

280
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,650
so we can understand that if and have

281
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,750
never used the command-line interface

282
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,870
and like just sit there and have type

283
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,660
comments people usually a bit don't know

284
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,340
where to start so that maybe it's bad

285
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,760
for like someone that has just start to

286
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,350
work like in Fargo's and then or they

287
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,760
also tell us that they are terrible to

288
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,710
generate visual information

289
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,439
so that's comprehensible for non-experts

290
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,240
so if one of the concerns that you want

291
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,310
to show some reporting to like some

292
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,230
management we're going to show like some

293
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,180
to someone that doesn't have this acute

294
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,460
expertise those reports cannot be

295
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,589
produced enough since that like be easy

296
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:01,690
to show people don't like to see just

297
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:03,940
text in front of them so but then what

298
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,340
actually was the good things about CLI

299
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,310
so then also if you don't know those bad

300
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,890
things about good things or CLI what's

301
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,030
good about whis

302
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,620
most of them actually praise the

303
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,930
usability aspect of like graphical user

304
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,000
interfaces so I have like a lot of the

305
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,949
coding happens on this file almost 600

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,390
common hands on waist on strands of

307
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,770
grease and what they really like they're

308
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,740
I select you of the course that they

309
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,089
have it the information displayed on a

310
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,809
more organized method

311
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:38,619
so when compared to CL ice so that is

312
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:40,899
really nice for them to use and also one

313
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:47,439
thing that is quite appear quite many

314
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:58,029
times is the whoops where's that alright

315
00:13:47,439 --> 00:14:01,959
I was my cursor that I actually don't

316
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:03,639
spend much time using Fireworks so if

317
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,968
they spend up to four hours a week using

318
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,439
Pharos they don't actually remember the

319
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:10,839
commands that they have to use it's

320
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:12,699
something that they they if they have to

321
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,259
spend much time remembering is not

322
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,669
efficient for the daily use so they

323
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,379
prefer to have something that actually

324
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:21,098
click around and they don't have to

325
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:23,529
remember anything and what actually was

326
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:25,989
bad about the graphical user interfaces

327
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,119
is that the missing features are

328
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:30,099
settings so they have like this that

329
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,059
they need to you CLI so this is they

330
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,459
need to do something that's very

331
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:35,348
specialized and the graphical user

332
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,988
interface don't have like the buttons

333
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:39,789
for that then they have to go back to

334
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:42,969
the CLI or they don't know how to do

335
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:45,279
that using Faro that only has like a

336
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:49,209
graphical interface or some graphical

337
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,709
interface for them to use and also that

338
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,098
the documentation of which they thought

339
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:57,429
was really bad or like it cannot be done

340
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:58,719
so actually the commenting quiz was

341
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,919
something that they thought it was

342
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:04,449
especially hard to do or like to prepare

343
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,769
to build something because they have

344
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:08,258
like to take screenshots after

345
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,029
screenshots after screenshots and that's

346
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,619
something that they they talk to the

347
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:16,299
commentators really difficult prepare

348
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:20,259
and you've come to use that said so what

349
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:22,959
we collect we actually could identify

350
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:26,949
this shifts our graphical user interface

351
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,988
so seasons traitors are like a movie for

352
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,238
they don't like this they're starting to

353
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:34,929
like stop using command-line interface

354
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:36,999
there's still some or that especially

355
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:38,559
the people like that they're using

356
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,899
command-line interface for many years

357
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,600
are still very resilient so they like to

358
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,050
use it they use we get

359
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,000
a bit upset with still do that we like a

360
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,439
graphical user interfaces so that from

361
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,940
like or the input for the users but to

362
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,360
is clearly still this shifted towers

363
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,490
graphical interface and we actually

364
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
tried to like sea water with possible

365
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,029
explanations for that with the some of

366
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,670
them are supported bar data and some are

367
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:08,459
inconclusive so it was the first one are

368
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,410
interfacing is getting better and from

369
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,388
what we hear of what you read is that

370
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,620
yes people said that the interface is

371
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,820
getting better they're not like they

372
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,279
were like 10 years ago

373
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,290
so far all companies are putting more

374
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,779
effort there they like more projects

375
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,370
around this to make them better so our

376
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:27,810
data actually supports a call or

377
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,930
qualitative data another hypothesis that

378
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:34,170
I was raised by we found and literature

379
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,910
is that the seasons traitors actually

380
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,769
getting less competent and because

381
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,319
you're less competent they don't like to

382
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,930
use graphical user interface command

383
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
line interface anymore but that's not

384
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,930
what orb data suggests or supports so

385
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,779
this is inconclusive because what we see

386
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,279
most of the people that S or a question

387
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,010
are where there have quite a high

388
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,730
expertise and they still there is no we

389
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:02,339
cannot like make any correlation between

390
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,480
expertise and the preference fork we saw

391
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:08,970
realized the third hypothesis be that

392
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,640
seasons traitors are doing much more

393
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,980
than used to do and therefore they have

394
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,459
less time to just spend their time using

395
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,470
learning common lines the Commons for

396
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,579
the specific fire or past were specific

397
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,470
to and that what actually this or data

398
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,540
supports so what you see that people

399
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,820
like spending less and less more or less

400
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,190
time like managing fire all the money

401
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,870
security tools and therefore they need

402
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,110
like things that are more usable that

403
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,250
they don't need to remember that often

404
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:45,809
they don't have enough remember like

405
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:48,059
comments all the time and what could

406
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,428
come out of that so like when you like

407
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,960
collect or data look at the order what

408
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,720
you have and they're like the direction

409
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,250
that things are going come out like some

410
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,530
design recommendations for like

411
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:03,480
new forests furro furro furro interfaces

412
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:05,040
and of course what or of course what we

413
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,660
want to do is something that were the

414
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,010
idea of pharoah interface now that

415
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,990
according to the suggestion that have

416
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,060
according to the what to read any the

417
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,880
mainland rotation out or the analysis is

418
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,679
that what actually the expect is

419
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,300
something that's like we have a like

420
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,410
easy transition between the graphical

421
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,870
user interface and command-line

422
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,800
interface so they want to use commands

423
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:28,770
they can like fallback if they want to

424
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,419
create a new macro sort like for their

425
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,860
commands that occur we can create a

426
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,270
button for doing that that's what they

427
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,340
would like to have that so like

428
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,360
reference interface says that actually

429
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,800
can be customized for their needs and

430
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,290
they were like like better ways of

431
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,970
course who doesn't right so lighter to

432
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,110
run not bloated that's a common

433
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,900
complaining about graphical user

434
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,870
interfaces that they're super heavy they

435
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,400
cannot run anywhere they would like to

436
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,080
have like a simple setup and

437
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,660
installation something that they can

438
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,250
they don't spend much time trying to

439
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,930
figure out how to install a graphical

440
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,740
interface for pharaoh because that's

441
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,570
something that some of them complain and

442
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,340
of correlation that that they would like

443
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,350
to have some scripting integrated into

444
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,830
dogs so they'll have some customization

445
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,600
properties and on the CLI side to make

446
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,520
it also like more accessible for like

447
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,560
first-time users or people that don't

448
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,030
spend much time using firewalls their

449
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,980
life have like better verification of

450
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,040
commands like Synthetica verification so

451
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,790
is this common correct or not and also

452
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,920
more examples integrate on the command

453
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,379
line interface so they can have like

454
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,470
when they have look for the help of a -

455
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,200
age they can get examples of what this

456
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:44,340
line would do in order to be the effect

457
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,830
because one thing that is actually some

458
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,780
of the mention is that if you want to

459
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,730
really destroy your fire configuration

460
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,680
the first ways to do that every CLI

461
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,600
because you just type one command wrong

462
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,160
press enter and then like everything's

463
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,919
gone so that's something that they're

464
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,050
also like afraid of so that's something

465
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,750
something that they're like the world to

466
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,159
be careful about and then with those

467
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,520
destroyed accommodations actually

468
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,990
conclude my talk so that'll be that bit

469
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:17,490
thank you for attention

470
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,490
[Applause]

471
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,460
hi thank you very much for that

472
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,629
Gus Andrews independent researcher and

473
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,930
writer I you alluded to the fact that

474
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,210
you may have analyzed preferences in

475
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,140
relation to expertise I'm wondering if

476
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,570
you can talk a little bit more about

477
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,370
that and then also I wonder if this is

478
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,570
generational - right just do people

479
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,600
prefer the interfaces they grew up with

480
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,000
did you analyze by age we didn't analyze

481
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:50,010
by age but I have a little you got your

482
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,120
hit my my backup slide which I analyzed

483
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,920
by proficiency so there - look at that

484
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,820
what to have here does the if it looks

485
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,670
like there's there's a bit like more

486
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,409
people that like have an expert and type

487
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,590
of knowledge actually prefer to I have

488
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,390
super force F CLI but is what you

489
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,370
analyzed statistically this data is not

490
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,820
significant enough so it cannot like

491
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,370
actually come out a conclusion that this

492
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,720
is really the case it looks like but we

493
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:24,270
cannot we cannot prove that not by age

494
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,850
yeah like okay we didn't look at the age

495
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,379
factor but then I can look at who can

496
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,360
look back back at the data and look that

497
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,580
we didn't also look at like a

498
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,610
nationality but like our survey was

499
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:39,389
translating for different languages and

500
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:43,919
then English Russian Portuguese and

501
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,210
Swedish and we got answers from most of

502
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,050
all ringing in English of course but

503
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,190
also got to like answering modal's so

504
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:53,399
I'm sorry but this is gonna be the final

505
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,340
question hi yeah fascinating research

506
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,160
chocolate Bristol cybersecurity group so

507
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,139
did you look at whether these test

508
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,790
admins were windows-based or Linux based

509
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,100
at all cuz I'd kind of expect two

510
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,050
windows admin to be more familiar and

511
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,730
more happy using a GUI than I would a

512
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,399
Linux one where you've only had IP

513
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,720
tables for years we didn't look about

514
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,429
specific I didn't ask about specific

515
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,179
tools because that's seen that when are

516
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:22,830
like this designing there's this survey

517
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:23,820
when anyone talked to the ready citizens

518
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,860
traitors they didn't

519
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,419
want any vendor specific questions or

520
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,899
anywhere specific questions because

521
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,970
they're really careful about not have

522
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,040
first not having surveys will usually

523
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,450
never have surface on this subreddit and

524
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,850
because they don't want advertisement of

525
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,820
companies or like any any sort of like

526
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,620
product placement so we have to show

527
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,270
their survey first so you have the

528
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,760
discussion then they have to prove our

529
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:54,780
survey so it took some time that's why

530
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,970
we could try to to see when you got the

531
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,070
pickup of s words that most of answers

532
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,960
came from two subreddit but and were

533
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,639
like also this limitation that the type

534
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,440
of questions you could answer or work

535
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,440
could yeah could you post

536
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,999
[Applause]
