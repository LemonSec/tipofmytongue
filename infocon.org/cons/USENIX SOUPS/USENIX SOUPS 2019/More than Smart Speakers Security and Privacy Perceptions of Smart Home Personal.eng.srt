1
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,020
and pull-ups noon everyone my name is

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,210
Laura I'm a beauty student from King's

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,250
College London today I will be

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,170
presenting my recent work on the

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,290
security and privacy of my home personal

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,390
assistants also known as SBA's and this

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,980
is a joint work with dr. Marvin from

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,110
University of Bristol and with my

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,880
supervisor dr. Jose from King's College

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:37,950
London so it's estimated that 10% of the

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,440
global consumers aren a smartphone

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,920
personal assistants with the Amazon echo

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,050
on Google home being the most used SBA's

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,989
and in 2018 3.2 million Google home on

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,269
2.5 million echo devices were sold

16
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,820
I'm sorry echo devices and it's system a

17
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:58,829
about these numbers will continue to

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,519
increase us more users will adapt into

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,069
these smart technologies so as these

20
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,960
devices continue to develop more users

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,779
will adapt into these technologies with

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,330
the Amazon echo show an Apple home pod

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,520
being the most recently launched as my

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,770
speakers of course this is growing in

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,890
terms of market reasons however as these

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,810
devices continue to develop their

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,000
security and privacy concerns also

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,869
increase with users not being able to

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,479
trust them at a minute and recent press

30
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,570
has reported the privacy concerns with

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,100
the Amazon Alexa with voice recordings

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,639
been listened to by Amazon stuff without

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,250
the uses awareness so the question is as

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,659
researchers what can we do to them not

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,119
only increase the security and privacy

36
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,469
mechanisms of for smart home business

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,270
systems but also gain the users trust

38
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,240
and so smart home personal assistance

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,759
such as the Amazon echo and Google home

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,548
allow users to perform various of tasks

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,640
such as asking a simple question to more

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,930
complex tasks such as controlling and

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,109
managing or the smart home devices

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,530
within the household and users are able

45
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:12,090
to set up third party skills and control

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,950
their other smart home devices within

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,730
the household using the mobile

48
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,220
application however these systems are

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,630
not just smart speakers they are part of

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,510
a complex ecosystem

51
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,670
so in our study received to underst

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,828
users perception of how they think the

53
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:33,030
SPI ecosystem works by considering all

54
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:35,400
the different components so this diagram

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,640
shows an overview of the smart hair and

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,799
personal assistant ecosystem the SP

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,750
ecosystem so on the left hand side you

58
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,819
can see the home which consists of this

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,860
math speaker and the other smart home

60
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,738
devices within the household you can

61
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,750
also see the cloud so for example once a

62
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,709
user makes a request such as asking a

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,560
question the data is processed by the SP

64
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,030
a cloud provider however the process is

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,909
slightly different when using third

66
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,639
party skills or other smart home devices

67
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:07,590
so not only is the data shared you know

68
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,739
it's not only the data process by the

69
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,810
SPL provider but also accessible to

70
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,940
other parties suggest if a party school

71
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,090
provider the other smart home device and

72
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,859
scope of Ida and so what we want to

73
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,480
essentially understand if users actually

74
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:25,170
know that their data is not only limited

75
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,940
to the sbam cloud provider so in our

76
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,760
work received to investigate users

77
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,799
understanding of the SPO ecosystem in

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,108
terms of the data activity so that

79
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,230
looking at the data processing data

80
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:40,230
sharing and data storage and the SBA's

81
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,599
capability to learn about the user we

82
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,518
also look at the users lack of trust of

83
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,220
one of the features which is shopping

84
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,379
with identified that and majority of

85
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,840
users were unable to trust this feature

86
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:56,578
after we've all studied the SP ecosystem

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,129
and we also identify SPF threats and

88
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,709
what sort of threats users think that

89
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,230
their devices are susceptible to we

90
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,879
discussed the urban strategies uses

91
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,888
implement to deal with the threats

92
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,739
they've identified and we find a

93
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,540
represent design implications for better

94
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,500
security and privacy mechanisms for

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,120
SBA's in the future so in terms of our

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,070
methodology we've conducted

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,490
semi-structured interviews with as

98
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,409
chronosphere users and we recruited

99
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,060
participant through a prolific platform

100
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:30,120
which is an online survey platform and

101
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,880
internally within our university we then

102
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,660
conducted a pilot test to only test to

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,330
test our interview script and mother

104
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,810
any changes for we did the actual study

105
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:45,010
and until all we've interviewed 17

106
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,260
Amazon echo on Google home users so in

107
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,730
terms of analyzing our data we follow

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,800
around a theory approach

109
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,570
so once we've collected the data then

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,330
two researchers have gone through the

111
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,760
findings and started identifying

112
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,909
patterns and relationships between the

113
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,070
codes and we've created a codebook we've

114
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,490
stopped and the interviews haven't

115
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,580
reached a saturation point

116
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,980
so MSBs can be used for various of tasks

117
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,140
so building skills which consists of

118
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,300
consists of things like asking a

119
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,580
question checking the weather checking

120
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,050
traffic updates to third-party skills

121
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,490
such as connecting the sba to Spotify

122
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,190
amoeba and other third party skills

123
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,390
using the SBA to control and monitor all

124
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,150
the smart home devices within the

125
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,740
household such as a smart light and

126
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,200
smart fridge and all the other smart

127
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,150
devices that use his own and the finally

128
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,800
shopping which is done via voice

129
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,810
purchasing so in our findings we see if

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,970
to understand user setup experience by

131
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,010
looking at the they experience in terms

132
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,220
of setting of voice recognition third

133
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,780
party skills and managing other smart

134
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,390
home devices within the household and

135
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,429
shopping we see if to understand the

136
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,200
users perception of the Esper ecosystem

137
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,360
looking at the data activities that

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,190
we've discussed earlier we look at the

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,830
user's reasons for not trusting shopping

140
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,500
and we identified the Esper threat and

141
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,760
the level of coping strategies user uses

142
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,830
implement to deal with the threat so in

143
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,590
terms of sba sort of we've identified

144
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,539
that majority of users have used their

145
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,229
personal Amazon account on google home

146
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,450
to set up the SBA which has then direct

147
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,690
link to their personal information such

148
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,250
as calendar home address bank details

149
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,710
for the seeker for the case of using

150
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,020
shuffelin so what we wanted to do was

151
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,989
understand why users have decided to use

152
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,640
their personal email address rather than

153
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,340
creating a fake one so we've identified

154
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,620
that was mainly for usability reasons so

155
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,940
being able to have access to dick

156
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,729
on several months and things like that

157
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,550
in terms of a voice recognition we've

158
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,080
identified that all Google home users

159
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,360
have set up this security feature

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,210
however the case was different for

161
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Amazon uses as only two of the ten

162
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,289
Amazon users that we've interviewed have

163
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,210
set up risk for the commission so we

164
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,460
want to of course understand why there

165
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,859
was less Amazon uses that set up this

166
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,409
feature so we found out that with Amazon

167
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,080
echo voice recognition is not initial

168
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,580
setter so majority of users weren't

169
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,490
aware that there was actually a security

170
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,859
stir and that it was complete sort of

171
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,550
not only protect themselves but also

172
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,500
protect their device so in terms of

173
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,860
understanding users perception of the

174
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,900
s.p.a ecosystem we've identified below

175
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:39,570
cannot be for different days activities

176
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:43,510
data storage learning sharing and

177
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,729
processing we've identified that users

178
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,340
have incomplete mental models of how the

179
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,050
spi ecosystem works but in terms of

180
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,419
considering all the different components

181
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,610
so they think that their data is only

182
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,490
limited to SP a cloud providers even

183
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,470
though they use in third-party skills or

184
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,960
use the SP a to control and manage all

185
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,360
the smart home devices without

186
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,580
considering the other four would without

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,880
considering the four ecosystem so in

188
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,919
terms of SBA's capability to learn about

189
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,680
the user we've identified that users

190
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,750
actually think that it has their AI

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,180
capability to learn information about

192
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,930
them such as their usage patterns and

193
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,090
routines so we further wanted to

194
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,560
understand each data activity so in

195
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,869
terms of data processing we've

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,870
identified that users think their data

197
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,839
is only processed locally so we've then

198
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,179
when an implemented D for usage scenario

199
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,039
so in terms of building skills users

200
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,049
think that their data is stored locally

201
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,760
in the smart speaker I mean it's

202
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:46,060
processed locally in this much speaker

203
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,100
and asked for third party skills they do

204
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,800
not mention anything about the third

205
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,950
party school provider having Brutus in

206
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,069
the data and ask for these smart home

207
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,160
devices

208
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,470
VA uses think that that in terms of the

209
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,959
communication between the SBA and the

210
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,610
other smart home device they think they

211
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,360
have direct communication without

212
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,350
considering the actual cloud and finally

213
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,960
in terms of shopping

214
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,660
they think that shopping through SBA is

215
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:20,740
processed normally like other online

216
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:23,930
shopping so moving on to data storage

217
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,610
users perceive that demo of data that

218
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,489
thought about them are things like voice

219
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,460
recordings requests and history locks

220
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,290
and shopmen so again implemented default

221
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,380
usage scenario so in terms of building

222
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,569
skills we've received and mixed

223
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,730
responses from the users so if some

224
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,320
users think that their data is stored

225
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,660
locally while the others think that it's

226
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,610
stored through the cloud and in terms of

227
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,189
third party skills they do not again

228
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,710
mention anything about the third party

229
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,710
skill provider having access to their

230
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,110
data or stolen day data and moving on to

231
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,460
the smart home devices they also do not

232
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,950
mention anything about the other smart

233
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,110
home devices providers haven't have an

234
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,330
access to data data in terms of storage

235
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,460
and in terms of shopping

236
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,770
you just think that and their shopping

237
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,020
history is stored about them however did

238
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,579
they do not mention how it's stored I'm

239
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,579
where it's time for how long it's stored

240
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:23,360
so moving on to data sharing users and

241
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,360
perceptions are influenced by the

242
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:31,120
stories of what data misuse in in use so

243
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:34,430
they think that hackers and data and

244
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,650
brokers would be able to get access to

245
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,349
users data to be able to then influence

246
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,600
their purchasing decisions and in terms

247
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,820
of like overall data sharing users do

248
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,980
not consider their artistical or dos

249
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:51,550
beyond third party is score such as

250
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:54,530
advertisers having access to their data

251
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:58,400
so finally in terms of users perception

252
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:00,680
of the SV ecosystem we looked at the the

253
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,939
SPE capability to learn about the user

254
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,410
so users think but SBA's are able able

255
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,279
to learn things about them so they

256
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,999
described as a small brain

257
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:14,370
having the memory with within artificial

258
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,199
intelligence they think that I can learn

259
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,480
things about them such as shopping

260
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:22,319
habits routines and favorite musics and

261
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,449
things like that they also think that in

262
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,399
terms of like attitude towards the

263
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:28,349
device being able to learn about users

264
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,389
we've received mixed responses so if

265
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,160
some users think it's positive in terms

266
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,720
of being able to learn personal

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,670
information about them to sort of like

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,600
in the future provide better

269
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,248
recommendations however some users think

270
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,290
it's bit like in terms of security and

271
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:44,939
privacy why is that it's a bit scary

272
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,920
they describe as it being sinister and

273
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:49,079
being able to learn sensitive

274
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,149
information about the user like health

275
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:56,430
symptoms it's not really a great thing

276
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:59,339
so as I've mentioned earlier shopping

277
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:02,339
was one of the key features that we've

278
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,649
identified by users in terms of users do

279
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,059
not trust and we wanted to understand

280
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,100
their reasons for not trusting this

281
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,559
feature so we've identified that users

282
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,259
don't trust shopping because of the lack

283
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,990
of product feasibility so with SBA's

284
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,670
being voice automated users are not able

285
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,319
to of course see what they're purchasing

286
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,000
so I'm not having enough information

287
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:24,809
about a product they were sort of

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,970
hesitant to use voice purchasing another

289
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:29,579
reason was not being able to see how the

290
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,829
payment is processed so with traditional

291
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,359
and online shopping you're able to see

292
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,699
when the payment is authorized but with

293
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,990
SPS you can't really see that so don't

294
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,410
know the reason why users didn't put it

295
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:44,819
in trust this feature and for the case

296
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,860
of Amazon echo most users did not trust

297
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,719
this feature because they think we were

298
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,420
able to hear their voice code out loud

299
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,029
so with Amazon and echo every time you

300
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,360
want to process a payment you would have

301
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:59,279
to say out loud for voice digit code so

302
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,019
you just think okay if someone is close

303
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,699
by or they want to use it for a

304
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,240
malicious malicious reasons then they

305
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,939
are able to then hear my voice code I'm

306
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,550
able to access my Amazon account and

307
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:13,620
complete purchases and finally another

308
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,889
reason the last reason was not having

309
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,360
enough vendors to purchase form so users

310
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:23,310
would avoid using shopping in general

311
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,529
so we wanted to sort of understand users

312
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,660
and understanding of what they think

313
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,390
their devices are susceptible to in

314
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,760
terms of security and privacy risks so

315
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,920
we identified this into tow through

316
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,709
agents and threat types so in terms of

317
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,019
her agents users think hackers

318
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:42,869
government and data brokers would be

319
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,060
able to target SBA's in the future so

320
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,310
that they are able to gain unauthorized

321
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,050
access to users data and use it for

322
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,170
whatever malicious reasons that is and

323
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,390
in terms of M threat types unwanted

324
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,089
listening most the most threat

325
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,550
identified by users and the reason being

326
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:02,130
with SPS being voice automated they

327
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,410
think okay we were able to like hear

328
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,019
what conversations users are having with

329
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:10,189
the device and sort of like use user for

330
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,829
whatever reasons they want to use it for

331
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,399
so to cope with the threats we have

332
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:19,680
identified users implement non-technical

333
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,079
coping strategies so they would turn off

334
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,660
the device so that people are not able

335
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,459
to hear their conversations they will

336
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,360
disable certain features such as am

337
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,768
shopping so that but then even though

338
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,540
they disable same features as the

339
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,269
shopping they will still use the sba to

340
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,430
do create shopping lists and completely

341
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,839
purchase an order using all their

342
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,089
devices for and another key thing that

343
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,250
we identified where some users were

344
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,199
unable to actually know what to do to

345
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,959
protect themselves so when we ask them

346
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,760
like okay what what would you do to like

347
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,609
make sure your device is safe they would

348
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,459
say okay well we can't install antivirus

349
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,699
so we don't know what to do so that of

350
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:06,869
course leaves those types of users into

351
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:09,060
like future attacks so to develop the

352
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,579
support and privacy mechanisms for a

353
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,319
space in the future of course better

354
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,050
awareness and transparency mechanism to

355
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,010
SPC SBA's is necessary so in terms of

356
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,959
would use has not been able to

357
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,959
understand how they how their data is

358
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,369
managed by the SP ecosystem creating

359
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,779
better awareness and transplanting

360
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,300
mechanisms would then allowed them to

361
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,520
sort of see what security and privacy

362
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,140
features are there so when creating

363
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,760
secretive I've seen em awareness

364
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,250
mechanisms we should consider factors

365
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,290
such as how the information is delivered

366
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,240
to the user in terms of the timing of

367
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,390
the information how stupid on how it's

368
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,180
presented to the user and one creating

369
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:52,260
use of all and control mechanism for

370
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:55,380
SBA's we should then go back to them the

371
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,330
AI capability of the sba we should

372
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,610
consider how we can use artificial

373
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,040
intelligence to create personalized

374
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,320
intelligent mechanisms for users so that

375
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,750
we have better data access management

376
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,790
policies but are unique to different

377
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,160
users and finally voice recognition

378
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,370
having that as a initial setup would

379
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,140
allow users to sort of know that there's

380
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,600
these security features that exist so

381
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,819
with Google home users they were able to

382
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,440
complete it with no problem with in

383
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,850
terms of Amazon echo users they weren't

384
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,940
able to actually know that there's this

385
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,240
type of security feature that exists so

386
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,860
having that there would then not only

387
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,460
increase the security of SPS but also

388
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,200
allow users to and protect themselves in

389
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,510
the future so finally in terms of

390
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,460
gaining users trust in terms of shopping

391
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,950
providing more information about a

392
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,580
product antman having more vendors would

393
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,830
allow users to gain bit more trusting in

394
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,960
shopping and having voice recognition as

395
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,630
an initial set up for Amazon echo would

396
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,520
avoid Amazon users having to repeat

397
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,939
voice purchasing I mean the voice code

398
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,829
every time they want to purchase so

399
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,830
that's it for me any questions

400
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,880
any questions alright then I ask a

401
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,420
question

402
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,130
so you mentioned coping strategies and

403
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,270
you shortly said they would disable

404
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,730
certain features what kind of features

405
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,349
would they just disable yeah so the main

406
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,390
features that we found that users would

407
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:30,060
avoid using would be the shopping

408
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,460
feature so although they did not trust

409
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,379
this feature they would use it for they

410
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,240
will still they would use in shop until

411
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,430
I create shopping lists but they

412
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
wouldn't go through with this full

413
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,560
process of purchasing it so they will

414
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,350
disable fit and with the voice code with

415
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,389
Amazon echo and their voice purchasing

416
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,649
completely because they didn't trust it

417
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:54,870
okay thank you

418
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,700
did you stratify the users who sampled

419
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,679
at all by whether they had audio only

420
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,780
devices or hybrid audio video devices

421
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:06,390
since both Google and Amazon now provide

422
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:07,920
both so the question so so we're example

423
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,900
with shopping you mentioned one of the

424
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,570
one of the fears was getting the wrong

425
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,480
product or lack of confirmation and so

426
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,220
on yeah both Google and Amazon now make

427
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,560
smart home devices with screens and

428
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,240
without screens yeah so one we conducted

429
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,060
the study that was before the Amazon

430
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,590
echo show was launched so the users had

431
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,960
a problem with not being able to know

432
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,270
what level of information they not been

433
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,480
able to trust what they're purchasing so

434
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:36,389
with in terms of like future work the

435
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,610
UMS PA should maybe like to gain users

436
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,410
trust have screens so that users are

437
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,510
able to see what they're purchasing so

438
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:48,330
that would eliminate that concern from

439
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:51,210
the user side hey so it was pretty

440
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,340
interesting to see you focus on a

441
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,130
specific use case and then sort of turn

442
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,389
up some some findings are a little

443
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,430
different from the general internet

444
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,770
perceptions kind of stuff right is

445
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,510
really cool that shopping led to these

446
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,430
new insights about problems that people

447
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,560
had there were there are other kinds of

448
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,570
skills or broadcasts as a use case that

449
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,399
you thought about focusing on or that

450
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,990
came up when you were talking to people

451
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,350
that would be really sort of interesting

452
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,520
for pushing on and in future studies and

453
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,889
I think it was mainly

454
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,530
just not know when mainly like not know

455
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,660
when what sort of security and privacy

456
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,240
mechanisms that are there to sort of

457
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,100
protect them so as I mentioned someone

458
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,600
said majority of users would say like we

459
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,629
don't know how to protect us also we

460
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,490
can't not install antivirus so like with

461
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,290
not them not trusting shot and feature

462
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,870
then what can we do in terms of like

463
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,270
future work to create better awareness

464
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,310
mechanisms for users by focusing on what

465
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:49,690
we found it does solve answers your

466
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:51,790
question was more it was more things

467
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,320
other than shopping that would be sort

468
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,870
of really interesting use cases or

469
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,370
there'd be some unique problems like

470
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,810
there's some relatively unique problems

471
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,550
in the shopping place that you called

472
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,560
out about like not being able to confirm

473
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,760
what the product was right and I was

474
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,669
just wondering if people talked about

475
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,290
other domains or use cases where they

476
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,410
had sort of special concerns that were

477
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,420
more specific than the general hey I

478
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,280
don't know how to assess risk or I don't

479
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,980
have the ability to do this that you see

480
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,990
in a lot of these kind of studies yes I

481
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,600
would say like uses not knowing how

482
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,930
their data is managed in terms of the

483
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,540
SPI ecosystem not knowing like how their

484
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,850
data is processed stored and shared that

485
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,920
was another element that we found that

486
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:39,399
users not having complete understanding

487
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:39,970
of how the ESPY echo system works last

488
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,630
question

489
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,630
oh hi thank you for the talk I have one

490
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:51,160
question since you used quality cereal

491
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,770
to analysis data and I'm wondering did

492
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:58,090
you have a forum serial or model at the

493
00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:01,030
end of the data analysis and this you

494
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:04,449
used grande Syria so normally you a

495
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,389
serial or model will be generated at the

496
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,610
end of the analysis yeah so we've

497
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,770
created a codebook sort of like based on

498
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:16,060
the themes and categories that we've

499
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:18,340
identified so any model of Syria that

500
