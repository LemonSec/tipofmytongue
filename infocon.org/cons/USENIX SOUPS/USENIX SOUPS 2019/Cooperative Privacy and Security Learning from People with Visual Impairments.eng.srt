1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,600
yes hello my name is Jordan Hayes I am

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,450
presenting our paper along with

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,610
Kaushik michael my co-author this is

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,460
also a joint venture with charlotte

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,500
price and young wong and today we'll be

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,270
talking about the ethnographic study

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,580
that we conducted over the last few

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,550
years where we attempted to understand

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,760
the privacy and security practices of

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:43,000
adults with visual impairments and their

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:46,449
allies so first it's important to be

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,820
cognizant cognizant I'm sorry and

13
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:51,629
reflexive about our potential our

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,370
position astre searchers about the

15
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,070
limitations and the biases that we may

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,800
encounter especially working with people

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,320
who have marginalized identities such as

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,330
people with disabilities and visual

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,290
impairments our research team consists

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,870
of a mix of genders and ethnicities we

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,650
work with a group of cisgender men and

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:18,130
women we also have Asians South Asians

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:22,689
Caucasians and Asian Americans on the

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:24,820
team I myself have a disability and but

25
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:27,339
this is not necessarily the same as

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,070
visual impairments it is not the same as

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,539
visual impairments so what we try our

28
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,089
best to do is understand our

29
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:37,090
participants experiences we always

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,280
realize there are some limitations so we

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,130
respect and give voice to our

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,149
participants experiences and their ways

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,890
of living so before we get into the

34
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:51,060
study itself I have three main takeaways

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,939
to share with you first and foremost

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,659
some participants have other disability

37
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,070
identities for example one person has

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,219
bipolar disorder the other is

39
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,809
hard-of-hearing these additional

40
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,969
identities along with their visual

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,280
visual impairments present challenges

42
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,040
that are very interesting for our

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,960
participants privacy and security these

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,739
different aspects of their marginalized

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,930
identities intersect and influence these

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,060
participants experiences so in other

47
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,200
words just looking at the visual

48
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,980
impairments themselves does not tell the

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,799
entire story

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,649
and lastly we advocate for feature

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,530
designs to incorporate some aspect of

52
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,750
cooperative privacy and security and

53
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,239
what that is is visual impaired

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,870
participants and their allies work

55
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:49,220
together to protect the privacy and

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,130
security our background and motivation

57
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,410
for the study is this first of all

58
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,690
existing NU through mechanisms and

59
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,329
designs for privacy don't really

60
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,739
consider the needs of users with visual

61
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,200
impairments for example you take a look

62
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,110
at that lock icon in the browser some

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,048
screen readers if not all them miss this

64
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,880
and what that means is users with visual

65
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,220
impairments are most likely to miss the

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,819
support and information and they're more

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,140
vulnerable to privacy and security risks

68
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:23,328
and that is why our long-term goal is to

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,920
design privacy and security mechanisms

70
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:29,959
that are inclusive to users with visual

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,119
impairments to considering their needs

72
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:38,359
in future designs and then third and our

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,910
existing studies cover the privacy and

74
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:43,639
security concerns of people with visual

75
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,280
impairments of what our study does is

76
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,010
really dive deep into the interactions

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,440
between the users with visual

78
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,130
impairments and their allies we feel as

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,280
though that's the novelty of the study

80
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,709
and allies could be such people as

81
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,859
family members friends and service

82
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:06,889
providers this leads us to our two

83
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:08,450
research questions number one what are

84
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,359
the everyday privacy and security

85
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,869
challenges and practices of people with

86
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:17,329
visual impairments and number two how do

87
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,060
people with visual impairments interact

88
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,060
with their allies what are the privacy

89
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,349
and security implications of such

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:31,070
interactions as far as our methodology

91
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:33,469
we conducted an ethnographic of research

92
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,080
method which consists of shadowing and

93
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,690
observation and that allowed us to

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,710
immerse ourselves in and understand our

95
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,350
participants daily life

96
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,450
and we realized this method will with

97
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,430
this method would allow us to obtain

98
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,099
interesting insights that participants

99
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,650
may not disclose during a formal

100
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,580
interview but we also wanted to

101
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,950
understand the background look and the

102
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,200
context behind our observation so that

103
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,780
is also why we included semi-structured

104
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,900
interviews and scenarios tasks

105
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,840
sandwiched between the observation and

106
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,729
channeling sessions we did a total of 13

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,340
sessions each over a two-day period

108
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,280
during the weekend and the weekday in

109
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,520
order to get an idea for what their home

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,500
and work life was like and we studied

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,390
the interactions between visually

112
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,950
impaired participants and their allies

113
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,530
because we felt that this important

114
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,630
aspect of our participants daily life we

115
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,780
recruited a total of 8 participants for

116
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,260
male for female 3 of them were blind to

117
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,849
had low vision and three of them were

118
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,640
allies we use flyers and email

119
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,500
solicitation as well as distributed

120
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,950
emails through local disability

121
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,900
community mailing lists to people with

122
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,020
disabilities we also visited service

123
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,179
organizations who provided help to

124
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,060
people with disabilities we I want to

125
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,730
point out that it it was challenging to

126
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,050
recruit populations of this nature not

127
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,330
just for this study but for other

128
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,940
studies in general mainly because of the

129
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,640
long hours and time commitment that was

130
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,130
required for this study but I also want

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,140
to say that in general recruiting

132
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,630
participants with visual impairments for

133
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,550
this study was quite a challenge we

134
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:22,640
recruited in the Syracuse New York area

135
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:26,040
and their ages ranged from 30 to 80 plus

136
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,010
in the data analysis realm we used what

137
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,780
we called mem which was just drafting

138
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,440
notes during the study reviewing and

139
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,169
then reflecting upon them we regularly

140
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,870
met with our research team to discuss

141
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,230
the codes and to create affinity

142
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,120
diagrams with posted notes and our

143
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,940
research was in part informed by

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,160
critical disability theories right and

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,180
relevant literature on such critical

146
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,300
disability series theories particularly

147
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,069
intersectional

148
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,470
I will be happy to take any questions

149
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,659
about that later on after the

150
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,930
presentation but I do not want to get

151
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:05,940
into that deeply right now instead

152
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,039
though I will turn it over to smarty and

153
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,759
she will cover the results and

154
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,550
discussion of our study more in depth

155
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,949
Thank You Jordan so I will be presenting

156
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,930
our results from our participants with

157
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,580
visual impairments starting with their

158
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,400
self perception of their disability

159
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,948
identities so we also have participants

160
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,840
with visual impairment about their self

161
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,530
perception of disability identities

162
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,830
mainly because it influences their

163
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:36,210
behavior in everyday practices which

164
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,599
consequently affect their privacy and

165
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:43,020
security in everyday life so for

166
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,520
instance our participants reported the

167
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,620
selective disclosure of visual

168
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,539
impairment and to highlight this point I

169
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,259
would like to share an example from our

170
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:56,190
participant p3 who is a retired educator

171
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:59,610
and has low vision so he suffers he

172
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,880
struggles to answer his emails that come

173
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,639
in large quantity and what he does not

174
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,380
want is broadcasting his visual

175
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,080
impairment to everyone in his contact

176
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,539
list rather he wants to selectively

177
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,250
disclose his visual impairment to only

178
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,949
those people that he really wants to be

179
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,190
in touch with and this also serves like

180
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:23,180
a practical utility for him to

181
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,289
effectively manage his communications

182
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,629
next I would like to share our

183
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:31,080
participant self definition of privacy

184
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:34,079
as we all know there are many but no

185
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,149
agreed-upon definitions of privacy so

186
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:39,448
instead of providing our version of

187
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,729
privacy or our definition of privacy we

188
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:43,978
ask our participants with vision

189
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,649
impairment and also they realize about

190
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,029
how they would define privacy in their

191
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:53,040
own terms and this helped us in two ways

192
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:55,199
one it helped us to contribute to the

193
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,510
prior literature in this area which

194
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,180
really focuses on people with visual

195
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,750
impairments view of privacy and number

196
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,579
two it helped us to unpack our

197
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:09,780
participants privacy concerns in

198
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,390
everyday life so for instance three of

199
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:17,010
our participants with visual impairment

200
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:19,069
define pipe previous like no worries so

201
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,510
three of our participants with the

202
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,580
visual impairment define privacy in

203
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,800
terms of ownership and control of their

204
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,750
personal information we subsequently

205
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,959
give them a sense of security while

206
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,000
performing their everyday tasks our

207
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,010
allies also describe privacy in terms of

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,530
their Alijah with our participants with

209
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,350
visual impairment for instance one of

210
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,290
our participant a one one of our ally

211
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,590
participant a one p one define privacy

212
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:49,260
in terms of his ally ship without

213
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,600
participant with visual impairment p1 so

214
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,780
he defines privacy in context of his

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,020
ally ship as he views the personal

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,750
information as one's own property that

217
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,220
is people's own property and privacy as

218
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,930
a right to protect that property and

219
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,990
overall we saw that all these

220
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:14,310
definitions shared a common theme of a

221
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:17,820
desire to have more agency and by that

222
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,979
we mean that by defining privacy as a

223
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,230
person control of of their private

224
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,030
information they wish to exercise some

225
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:29,520
sort of agency thank you now we're going

226
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,709
to discuss our participants with visual

227
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,960
impairments concerns for everyday

228
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,180
privacy and security while using

229
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,850
technology in three kinds of settings

230
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,109
the work settings public settings and

231
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:46,050
home settings while the prior literature

232
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,970
extensively covers the concerns privacy

233
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,130
related and security related concerns in

234
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,800
work in public settings and we find

235
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,290
similar results such as leaking of their

236
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,780
personal information through enlarge

237
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:02,160
computer screens or shoulder surfing and

238
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,630
similar kinds of reported activities the

239
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,510
results from the home settings were

240
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,510
somewhat unique and less studied in the

241
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,939
prior literature so in the home setting

242
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,890
we observed that while using technology

243
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,360
devices our participants were plagued by

244
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,310
certain deceptive practices such as

245
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,430
scams

246
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,380
and viruses and to highlight this point

247
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,810
I would like to share an example from

248
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:32,120
our participant p1 who is legally blind

249
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,150
thank you so as you can see on the

250
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,640
screen our participant p1 while

251
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:41,300
demonstrating to us how he logs into his

252
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,880
email he encountered a fake virus

253
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,000
warning on his web browser which the

254
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,310
stream reader was unable to read and his

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,640
reaction was what's wrong what's

256
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:55,819
happening so this shows or this

257
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,699
observation highlights that although

258
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,700
anybody can fall prey to such popup ads

259
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,390
and scams our participants with visual

260
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,710
impairment were particularly vulnerable

261
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,260
especially if the screen reader does not

262
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,820
reach such proper warnings and they may

263
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,080
accidentally click such warnings and

264
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,270
fall prey to such scams next I would

265
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,960
like to share our participants our

266
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,240
social relationships and interactions so

267
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,339
our participant with visual impairment

268
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,110
interacted with their allies which

269
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:30,230
formed a huge part of their everyday

270
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:34,670
practices and consequently affected

271
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:37,040
their privacy and security so we divided

272
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,410
these interactions into five to six

273
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,630
domains as you can see here but for the

274
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,910
brevity of this presentation I will be

275
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,610
focusing on the family relationships and

276
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,380
the allies perspective before we dive

277
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,420
into the family relationships and allies

278
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,120
perspective I would like to highlight

279
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,910
that these interactions reflected an

280
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,190
underlying nature of relationships which

281
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,400
focus on agency trust and

282
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,440
interdependence now focusing on the

283
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,589
relationship of family relationship

284
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,220
this included spouses domestic partners

285
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:13,610
parents children and siblings while in

286
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,160
general these relationship had a general

287
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,620
sense of interdependence mutual trust

288
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,410
and shared decision-making they were

289
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:25,160
certain aspects certain privacy concerns

290
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,870
that our participant felt while asking

291
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,540
for help from their family members and

292
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,190
to demonstrate this point I would like

293
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,620
to share an example from one of our

294
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,370
participants

295
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,770
who has low vision so a participant

296
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,580
before who has low vision she hesitates

297
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:44,319
to ask for help from her daughter when

298
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,020
she has to fill a some form which has

299
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,990
financial information such as herself

300
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,090
information and she explains that

301
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,740
although she trusts her daughter and her

302
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,380
children in general with financial

303
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,360
information she feels that they may

304
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,160
accidentally reveal that information to

305
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,380
her ex-husband which may put her at some

306
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,060
sort of financial risk so this

307
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:09,520
highlights that although you know family

308
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,609
members are trustworthy but privacy

309
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,370
concerns motivate our participants

310
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,140
vision impairment to ask for help in

311
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,000
everyday mundane life and how they would

312
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,949
ask for us what kind of help next I

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,080
would like to highlight our allies

314
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,860
perspective which was also an important

315
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,690
contribution of the study so each of our

316
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,670
ally participants also had like really

317
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,920
interesting and unique perspective about

318
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,410
their relationship with our participants

319
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:43,020
with visual impairment for instance a1p

320
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:46,060
one neither respected pians agency and

321
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:49,120
advocated not to offer help unless he

322
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,719
won ask for help himself for example in

323
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,840
case of laundry and he also perceived me

324
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,710
when to be independent and managed more

325
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,990
suspects of his life himself and this

326
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,850
and other examples as you can see on the

327
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,010
paper and we're happy to answer more

328
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,550
questions with such for such examples

329
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,170
later on in the presentation so this

330
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,719
brings us to the implications for

331
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,060
research and design what can be learned

332
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,100
from the insights of people with visual

333
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,800
impairment and their interactions with

334
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,810
their allies and how that can help the

335
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,209
privacy design and research in the

336
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:29,560
future so we notice that the existing

337
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:32,910
tools focus on independence where the

338
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,079
emphasis is on individual that

339
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,110
individual is going to protect his or

340
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,260
her own privacy and they will not rely

341
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,100
on anyone else although we value such

342
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,740
components but we also would like to

343
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,949
propose a more complementary solution

344
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,680
which is cooperative privacy management

345
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,899
solution by which we would like to call

346
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,029
attention to their SPECT of mutual

347
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,279
assistance between people with visual

348
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:01,500
impairment and their allies so that

349
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,569
together they can work towards a common

350
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,430
goal of protecting the privacy and

351
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:10,829
security of people with visual

352
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,709
impairment so for example what could a

353
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,899
cooperative privacy solution look like

354
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:19,680
well it could look like a mobile app

355
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:22,170
where people with visual impairment can

356
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,380
share any information such as their

357
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,959
daily schedules any common tasks lists

358
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,149
with specific allies that they want to

359
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,489
share that information with they can

360
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,970
also have real-time chat features while

361
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,779
trying to well having full control over

362
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,759
disclosing what kind of personal

363
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:44,720
information they want to disclose lastly

364
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,139
we would like to share our implication

365
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,639
focusing on the marginalized identities

366
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:53,819
so the multiple and intersecting

367
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,709
marginalized identities that these

368
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,319
individuals might have should also be

369
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,930
the focus of such studies mainly because

370
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,269
the traditional privacy research study

371
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,579
in this area of people with visual

372
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:07,740
impairment tends to focus on a single

373
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,470
marginalized identity that is their

374
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,480
visual impairment however the privacy

375
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,000
design needs to consider the

376
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,309
multi-faceted and intersectional aspect

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,419
of these peoples marginalized identities

378
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:23,129
and one practical way of doing this is

379
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:26,250
through participate to design an action

380
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,689
research such an approach could engage

381
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,150
these users throughout the design

382
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:32,960
process and help the designers to learn

383
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:36,590
more about their multiple identities

384
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,530
lastly we would also advocate more

385
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:42,270
inclusive approach where researchers are

386
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,889
aware of their own potential biases and

387
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,940
limitations and adopt a more

388
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,400
socio-technical approach at the end we

389
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,770
would like to thank our participants for

390
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,060
their insights anonymous reviewers and

391
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:58,450
Shepherds for their feedback and the

392
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,220
agencies for supporting this research

393
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,050
that's all for now thank you so much for

394
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:13,100
your attention and we are now open to

395
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:14,930
questions okay so time for questions and

396
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,449
then if the next speaker could come and

397
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:25,610
start setting up while we do the

398
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:28,520
questions you need to begin to come up

399
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,530
and come to the microphones sorry for

400
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:38,629
that so we've got one already but we'll

401
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:41,090
come back crystal I found it quite

402
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,560
interesting the example of where the

403
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:48,649
fake virus thing pops up I wondered if

404
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,080
you looked at as to whether the if the

405
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,120
screen reader were to read it what the

406
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,659
users going to be equally susceptible

407
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:01,250
than than if it didn't well that's a

408
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:05,210
very interesting view so this particular

409
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,570
observation we did while the predefined

410
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,270
tasks towards the end of the session and

411
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:15,649
the aim of that predefined task was not

412
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:18,230
to interrupt our user by testing other

413
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,720
theories so it was more about providing

414
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,880
a mold non-intrusive way of how they

415
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,030
would interact with their systems so we

416
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,580
did not see if they would still be

417
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,860
susceptible to such camps of the

418
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,480
screenreader were to read it so that is

419
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:36,100
something that we can try probably in

420
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,140
the future okay thanks for the question

421
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,120
we're all your allies that participated

422
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,400
were those all in the more the home

423
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,129
setting or did you have any work setting

424
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,420
allies and did you were able to

425
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,430
investigate that at all and what the

426
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:55,160
different interactions considerations

427
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:58,070
may have been we had one Ally p1 p1

428
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,780
hadn't like a 1 p1 who was an office

429
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:06,450
manager but we saw that he was also his

430
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:10,230
friend so they worked together in the

431
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:13,440
office but even people would also help

432
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,230
him with tasks outside the office so we

433
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,399
saw that often such a relationship were

434
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,690
trustworthy and went beyond their

435
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:23,330
socially constructed responsibilities

436
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,529
mainly because of the trusted

437
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:32,759
relationship that had formed Hayden

438
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:35,879
Cosley Cornell University and NSF so I'm

439
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,009
trying to think about whether this is

440
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:40,199
really about their identities as someone

441
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:42,419
who's visually impaired or some of the

442
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,090
other sexual identity components or

443
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:47,129
whether it's more about just the need to

444
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,109
have collaborative use right it's like

445
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:51,029
Elena mentis has looked at you know

446
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:53,549
caregivers for older adults ish Teac

447
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:55,309
akhmet has looked at you know sort of

448
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:58,289
you know shared use for low literacy

449
00:20:55,309 --> 00:21:01,168
populations I'm just wondering if like

450
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:03,450
the same kinds of concerns and design

451
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:07,019
prescriptions are gonna show up in in

452
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,730
any setting where there's kind of you

453
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,679
know this sort of need to rely on other

454
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,779
people to help you accomplish your tasks

455
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,960
and so I'd be curious to know what you

456
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:18,809
think about that how it applies to other

457
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,090
kinds of caregiving or impairment

458
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:23,009
situations and since you invited me

459
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,779
Jordan you invited us to ask you about

460
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:27,330
the intersectionality aspect so I'll go

461
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,830
ahead and give you an opportunity to

462
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,269
turn that question towards the

463
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,759
intersectionality stuff if you want

464
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:36,929
thank you very much from what I can

465
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:39,779
understand I think what I don't know

466
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:42,299
each population is different but if I

467
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,519
had to guess probably that week this

468
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,549
whole thing about intersectionality or

469
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,980
these marginalized identities that they

470
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:52,289
can apply in my opinion I think they do

471
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,710
apply to more than just people with

472
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:58,109
visual impairments I think any type of

473
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:01,799
population marginalized identity whether

474
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:03,299
it's gender disability race or whatever

475
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,299
I think that's going to be more

476
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,369
generalizable and I think also when we

477
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,460
look at the intersection I'm sorry if we

478
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,720
look at the interactions between the

479
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,239
participants the allies I also think

480
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,499
that's going to have more

481
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:17,420
generalizability in regards to the

482
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:20,020
interactions

483
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,210
and the privacy and security

484
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,420
implications of such if you want to talk

485
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,520
to us more about this we'd be happy to

486
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,270
talk to you in the in the open session

487
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,950
sir

488
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:36,510
during any of the breaks okay great so

489
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:41,329
thank you again

490
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,329
[Applause]
