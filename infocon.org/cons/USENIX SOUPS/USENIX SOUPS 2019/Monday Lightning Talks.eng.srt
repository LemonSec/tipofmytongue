1
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:16,560
okay principles of secure design usually

2
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,110
when I give this talk people in the room

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,329
say their principles and we have to

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,710
follow them in this case you all know at

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,400
least as much as I do about this and

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,259
quite a bit more so in 1975 Seltzer and

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,439
Schroder came up with these principles

8
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:34,739
of secure design in 1977 a little-known

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,360
movie came out Star Wars which will

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,288
actually tell you everything you need to

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,370
know about secure design starting at the

12
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,590
top simple

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,750
shouldn't also be known as economy of

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,480
mechanism means less points of failure

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,130
and power didn't do so well following

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,930
that one when it created the second

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,640
death star and that complicated screen

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,430
on the moon of Endor to many places

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,460
things can go wrong and they did however

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,700
next principle failsafe when they

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,769
created Princess Leia's dungeon and she

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,930
had people come rescue her they did an

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,790
excellent job of causing them to fail

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,439
over and over because when they showed

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,850
up they could get into the cell block

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,770
and they couldn't get out and they tried

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,940
to go down the garbage chute and they

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,649
couldn't get out and when they were

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,240
there the monster came out at them and

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,130
they couldn't get out in fact if they

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,729
had followed the next principle they

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,339
wouldn't fine I've been fine which was

33
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,340
the complete mediation if something goes

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,380
wrong you have complete mediation and

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,940
c-3po shows up and explains it all to

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,690
you and you're never left wondering what

37
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,610
to do least privilege case well you have

38
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,770
give people the least amount that they

39
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,930
need to know remove choices that you

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,240
don't want them to make my favorite

41
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,619
example is obi-wan not telling Luke

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,479
about you know what's his name his

43
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,780
father because they don't want them to

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,810
choose the dark side we shared you have

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,220
commands that are used differently and

46
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,869
if you have shared controls that's a

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,390
problem one of our favorite ways to

48
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,220
object to this is don't share your

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,920
passwords across site because they get

50
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,408
one they get them all so the example of

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,649
that is the clones that are all work the

52
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,349
same and then our heroes who work

53
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,360
differently separate privileges no sir

54
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,720
all-powerful IDs we talked about that

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,130
earlier if they had done that our 2dg

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,280
would not have been able to save our

57
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,569
heroes from the dungeon open design do

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,420
not make it depend

59
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,369
on secrecy for it to be safe in other

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,619
words everybody should know how it works

61
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,900
but not what it is great example is

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,760
passwords everybody knows how it works

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,099
but they don't know your password and

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,929
pyre totally screwed up on that by

65
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,548
creating these Death Star plans which

66
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,930
were then stolen and once they knew how

67
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,689
they work they were able to compromise

68
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,329
them lessor price make it work the way

69
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,310
people expect it to work pretty simple

70
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:51,870
that's the way I always want it and come

71
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,639
up to door I want to know whether you

72
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,939
push or pull so I don't look stupid or

73
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,849
follow a known model great example or

74
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,989
they say is in you know pilots hop into

75
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,250
one of those spaceships and they

76
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,959
immediately know how to fly it

77
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,969
I don't know if I believe that and then

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,010
there's the lightsaber the lightsaber

79
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,948
works the way you expect you swing it it

80
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,138
cuts it goes whoosh so you get to the

81
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,829
end of that and you've got eight

82
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,000
principles but what I noticed was oh

83
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,519
five of those principles are user

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,280
focused so I can apply usability

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,069
principle and not teach a secured

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,569
principles and then seven more usability

87
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,399
principles I can teach these eight

88
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,470
principles and I have five of them that

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,930
relate right back to the user so if we

90
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,430
really were following all the principles

91
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,109
for security design we would have

92
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,650
usability and the problem is we're not

93
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:43,409
following true secure design principles

94
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,479
now after I gave this talk people keep

95
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,828
asking me for the information on it and

96
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,599
what they could get is my slides and

97
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,009
they say I don't know what you said so

98
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,209
now there's an app for that actually

99
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:56,099
there's a web app for that so you can

100
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,340
play the Star Wars game and take a tour

101
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:06,978
of the Star Wars universe and review

102
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,979
your principles I got one more minute

103
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:14,339
gonna take my last minute here right

104
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:19,590
back to this is Who I am

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:23,070
in case you didn't know that and if--and

106
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:25,429
here is oops it's not showing what I

107
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,430
have on my screen

108
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm still going to come in under five

109
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,508
there we go

110
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,250
close enough so I have a landing page

111
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:46,560
there where you can participate and play

112
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,520
the Star Wars game and it's Kai

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,800
it's--but lead /sw secure design I will

114
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,630
put that link on my overhead which he

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
will publish and you can click on that

116
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:06,300
learn more send me an email and what is

117
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:08,250
there thank you all right okay I'm not

118
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,919
gonna show the one minute sign I'm only

119
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,169
gonna show the 15 second side

120
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,900
there's too much colorblindness in the

121
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:18,479
audience for today okay it's it's just

122
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:31,530
hard okay blame yeah I'm blaming the

123
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:33,389
user that's right all right so so hi so

124
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,919
i'm mallanna banana I'm Canadian I'm

125
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,210
here in the USA

126
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,469
you know I'm Canadian because if you're

127
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,799
to push me I would turn around and say

128
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:42,150
I'm sorry I started the research a

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,770
little bit backwards I'm the chair of

130
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,570
cybersecurity and behavior at Western

131
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,219
Sydney University I work with a really

132
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,240
interdisciplinary team in cybersecurity

133
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:53,520
but I also do special advisory work for

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,190
a cybercrime investigation company and

135
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,840
this research is phase one of a project

136
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,330
that was born out of the work that I do

137
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,549
in hunting down cyber criminals

138
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,190
particularly in the payment diversion

139
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,169
fraud and cryptocurrency space and in

140
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,960
recovering assets for billionaires that

141
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:14,068
get duped constantly so what we're

142
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,568
finding amongst those companies we we

143
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,490
started the research a little bit

144
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,319
differently we didn't want to design a

145
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,060
survey or head into certain kind of

146
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,580
components until we better understood

147
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,219
exactly what was happening so we reached

148
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,979
out to companies that had been victims

149
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,360
of payment diversion fraud or as you

150
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,659
call it here in the US I think quite

151
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,069
often business email fraud so these were

152
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,740
companies that were losing anywhere

153
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,719
between $13,000 in a single payment all

154
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,490
the way up to 12 million in a single

155
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:43,349
payment that was diverted overseas

156
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,120
there was even one attempt at a hundred

157
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,130
million dollars in a single diversion

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,320
payment we when we interviewed these

159
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,909
companies and that is forming the basis

160
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,060
for the survey and the empirical work

161
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,620
that will come afterwards so in if I

162
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,360
could summarize the research and what we

163
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,460
found in the ten interviews it would be

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,480
cognitive dissonance so here are the

165
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,099
things that we found that we're not

166
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,540
seeing in other literature in the area

167
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,730
because most of the other literature in

168
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,560
the area is focused heavily on phishing

169
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,210
how to prevent the phishing attacks from

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,900
getting in to begin with or the

171
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,880
spearfishing

172
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,289
if we started with presumption that a

173
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,850
certain amount are always gonna get

174
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,830
through any system and what are the

175
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,170
processes once the Spearfish has gone

176
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,210
through and the payment diversion cycle

177
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,980
is hit and here the summary of the

178
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,260
results in about I don't know what's

179
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,820
remaining three minutes two minutes two

180
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,820
three minutes okay I've got time

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,460
companies this this one behavior wise

182
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,860
really struck a chord with me in all of

183
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,799
the interviews that we did each and

184
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,120
every company thinks because they were

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,420
hit and sent the payment overseas that

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,760
they won't be hit again so for me that

187
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,980
was really alarming and kind of funny

188
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,659
right because as a threat researcher we

189
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,220
know how often threat changes and

190
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,440
they're just gonna modify and adapt

191
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,260
their strategies to get you a second

192
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,800
time the second interesting component is

193
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,320
that unlike other frauds because we do a

194
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,870
lot of work in binary options pyramid

195
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,270
and cryptocurrencies they have really

196
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,000
distinctive money patterns if you follow

197
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,159
the money read back payment diversion in

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,290
the ten interviews that we did does not

199
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,910
so typically you'll find with money

200
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,580
laundering it'll go through Singapore or

201
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,500
Hong Kong almost always in the ten

202
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,240
instances where we did none of it went

203
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,130
through Hong Kong as Singapore it was

204
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,140
going to Mexico it was going to Sweden

205
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,909
and that actually took me for surprise

206
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,280
so to me that tells me there's a much

207
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,459
more diverse group of people behind the

208
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,589
payment diversion fraud third we were

209
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,510
given access to all the detailed reports

210
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,190
from these diversions and that's been

211
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,530
really interesting

212
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,570
so my team has a background in digital

213
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:52,500
forensics pentesting behavioral

214
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,380
scientists law network security we've

215
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,940
got the whole gambit so we're kind of

216
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,670
going into this from a holistic

217
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,210
perspective to see what we can tease out

218
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,520
for the next proponents of the survey

219
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,290
the only thing I can say is even once a

220
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,930
company was hit not only did they not

221
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,310
believe they're going to be hit again

222
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,140
there would be detailed reports on what

223
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,520
they could do to prevent this thing in

224
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,260
the future and usually they would only

225
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,020
uptake one or two out of the twenty

226
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,000
recommendations and here's the best part

227
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,430
of the companies that done fishing

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,710
training didn't help one bit not one bit

229
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,390
and so for me it's really curious to see

230
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,670
all this research and how you can do a

231
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,050
training but in the interviews it was

232
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,050
proven even the one company they just

233
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,520
given their training like thirty less

234
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,109
than two weeks and they were hit by the

235
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,990
payment diversion rate after the

236
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,350
training right this is sophisticated and

237
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,460
these people are in systems it's not

238
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,250
some of the fishing we looked at all of

239
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,340
the copying you know they had clearly

240
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,170
been in this adversary system for a long

241
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,270
time the wreckin essence that was done

242
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,969
was not something minor that was done in

243
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,620
a fashion overnight you know it's a

244
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,210
spearfishing and then once they were in

245
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,160
the system really doing a lot of

246
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,020
recognizance the other thing is none of

247
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,750
the amounts that they asked for with the

248
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,290
companies were arbitrary not once not

249
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,900
ever really specific amounts that

250
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,310
mimicked precise similar types of

251
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,189
payments that they would have made to

252
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,530
that company and in one instance this

253
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,330
was a payment that was going to be made

254
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,370
because the company was merging with

255
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,500
another company and the diversion of

256
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:34,359
attack was of that

257
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:34,359
[Applause]

258
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,380
listing

259
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:17,839
hi everyone today I'll be presenting my

260
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,980
ongoing work on planning to design more

261
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:25,760
inclusive alerts for privacy and

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,760
security in our daily lives which we are

263
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,460
we are exposed to various kinds of

264
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,770
alerts when we use our computers and our

265
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:39,000
mobile phones but have you ever thought

266
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,829
how a person who might be of like who

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,170
might be offer agent background who

268
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,640
might be a elderly person or child how

269
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:55,380
would they behave when they exposed to

270
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:58,170
these kinds of alerts and with increased

271
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,700
globalization and increase mobile phone

272
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,829
adoption around the world we have

273
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,080
increased our diversity of users whether

274
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,950
it's elderly person or blind person or

275
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,900
deaf person using this exposed to these

276
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,060
alerts so I'll be mainly using the

277
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,089
hitchhike yell framework developed by

278
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:25,020
Professor Laurie Corona to look at how I

279
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:26,910
can make it more inclusive okay so if I

280
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,199
look at Singapore specifically in the

281
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,779
past three years there's been a

282
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:37,200
significant increase in children below

283
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:39,060
seven years old okay children below

284
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,100
several years old and elderly above

285
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,260
sixty years old

286
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,690
adopting a smartphone but as we all know

287
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:50,430
these users don't have much security and

288
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:52,709
privacy knowledge and I'm planning to

289
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,020
use inclusive design methods where it's

290
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,699
potentially shown to benefit entire

291
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,579
population when you design for this

292
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,290
underrepresented or marginalized groups

293
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,570
and what you can see in this picture

294
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,189
here is a curb cut where originally it

295
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,230
was designed for those who are

296
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,750
wheelchair-bound but in ended up

297
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,250
benefiting the entire society so this is

298
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,380
one of the benefits of inclusive design

299
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,360
so you can see how external in the hitch

300
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,610
ITL framework you can easily see how

301
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,550
external factors and the human factors

302
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,780
affects how a user would behave when

303
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,020
they exposed to alert

304
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,449
and these are the steps a designer would

305
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,860
pick when they are applying the

306
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,960
human-in-the-loop framework the hitch

307
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,670
IDL framework first he identifies what

308
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,230
is the task the usual performing this

309
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,209
could be either browsing a website or

310
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,010
installing application and the designer

311
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,850
can choose to automate some of the steps

312
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,100
based on the user and you can identify

313
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,290
the potential failures the user might

314
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,930
experience as a reservist background or

315
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,300
cultural differences or age capabilities

316
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,180
etc and finally you mitigate the

317
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,920
potential failures he could be exposed

318
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:04,260
to so are we using the inclusive I will

319
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,900
be using the lead user approach which is

320
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,450
developed by one Appel and this will be

321
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,280
actually using looking at extreme users

322
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,740
who are usually not considered when a

323
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,770
designer designs a system and these lead

324
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,660
users usually exhibit needs which are

325
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,760
higher demanding as compared to the

326
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,829
general population and sometimes when

327
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,460
you design for the lead users you could

328
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,810
benefit the general population as well

329
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,910
so in order to adopt the lead user

330
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,530
method first you identify lead users

331
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,329
based on extreme conditions these

332
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,089
extreme conditions could be you can look

333
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,920
at the age ages of the ages itself we

334
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,770
can look at a very young person or old

335
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,079
person who has some individual who has

336
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,210
very good technical capabilities or very

337
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,230
little hip capabilities and then you

338
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:51,240
design for them and you validate whether

339
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,560
the general population also benefits

340
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,630
when you design for this population

341
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,660
group and if they need if they are

342
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,310
usability issues when you face by the

343
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,860
general population you have to make some

344
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,020
minor tweaks so when you consider when

345
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,970
you combine both these methods you want

346
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,770
to consider the lead users in these

347
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,020
three steps when you apply the

348
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,360
human-in-the-loop framework so let's say

349
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,460
I have a fictional user lead user see

350
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,580
who is a Singaporean elderly person he

351
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,350
just upgraded from a Nokia feature phone

352
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,640
to a smart phone but he doesn't have any

353
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,030
knowledge about how to browse the

354
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,680
websites or how to set up his own Google

355
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,329
account maybe the shopkeeper set it up

356
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,160
for him and he wrote down the password

357
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,920
so he doesn't even know how to manage it

358
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,560
but he's still using this smart phone so

359
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,329
when we empathize with this user we will

360
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,219
definitely consider what other failures

361
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,970
he might experience and this could

362
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,230
potential

363
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,860
potentially benefit the general

364
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,810
population as well so the three points

365
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,310
on the left side I actually extracted

366
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,930
from the human-in-the-loop framework I

367
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,760
didn't consider all of them but is just

368
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,880
three of them so you can immediately

369
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,770
identify that let's say when you're

370
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,450
designing a system for a smart nation or

371
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,579
for the entire world we will definitely

372
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,860
have users from diverse backgrounds so

373
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:08,280
how do you design a system which is

374
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:11,700
resilient for the entire population is

375
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,770
it done yeah so I hope to provide more

376
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,800
Asian perspective since I didn't find

377
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,620
much papers from Asia so that's all and

378
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,569
I hope to reduce the weirdness of this

379
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,850
research most of the research seems to

380
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:47,460
be from the US and Western eyes yeah

381
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:51,270
that's all we got one more hello let's

382
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,830
do it great so my title is a bit of a

383
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,240
mouthful so we're gonna jump right in

384
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,560
I'll give you a sense of why you should

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,530
give me your attention for the next

386
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,030
couple of minutes so to sum up this is

387
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,880
going to be an I did something so you

388
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,740
don't have to kind of a talk ideally

389
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,720
I'll give you something portable and a

390
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,490
tool to help you make your own

391
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,500
comparisons dig a little bit deeper I

392
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,990
looked at a new multi-factor

393
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,359
authentication scheme and I'm gonna help

394
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,220
you locate it in a crowded field so if

395
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,020
you do do working usable security and

396
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,339
authentication you're stuck always

397
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,500
having to make the argument about the

398
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,569
persistence of passwords they're gonna

399
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,300
stick around right probably you go a

400
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,179
little bit deeper maybe you look at new

401
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,760
schemes to potentially replace passwords

402
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,610
or augment legacy textual passwords if

403
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,860
you're thorough right now looking at

404
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,649
what's new means considering the recent

405
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,570
offering from Google who in April of

406
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,640
2019 released a multi-factor

407
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,530
authentication scheme that would permit

408
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,420
the users of Android handsets to use

409
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,440
their phone as a multi-factor

410
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,720
authentication key

411
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,060
would ideally operate similar to any

412
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,460
photo compliant security key that you're

413
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,350
used to in short the scheme is new it's

414
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,770
hot and it's not being widely discussed

415
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,600
in academic spaces among other things

416
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,550
the developers of Android security keys

417
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,679
claim that they provide a similar set of

418
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,320
security benefits to USB based

419
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,930
implementations so to put their claims

420
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,159
to the test I did an early usability -

421
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:23,490
playability security analysis using the

422
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,840
framework of Benoa at all so you can

423
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,250
look at this briefly but please don't

424
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,870
try to read it you'll hurt your eyes

425
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,880
it's just my beautiful la Tech I'm I'm

426
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,639
proud of the important thing to do when

427
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,040
comparing authentication schemes is to

428
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,770
determine if and how a new scheme might

429
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,060
improve upon the incumbent technology so

430
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,610
in my case I was looking at Android

431
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,850
security keys and principally USB based

432
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:46,649
security keys and comparing these

433
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,810
schemes I did identify an important

434
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,150
trade-off when it comes to usability

435
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,679
there's no special purpose hardware and

436
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,440
nothing new to carry when you're using

437
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,030
your handset as a key unfortunately

438
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,110
you're also stuck interacting with your

439
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:03,030
phone's UI your lock screen and you are

440
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,520
instead of just touching a capacitive

441
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,250
sensor for your proof of presence beyond

442
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,889
that when you consider a basic set of

443
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,510
UDS benefits pretty similar there are

444
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,640
differences in deployability that we can

445
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,150
forgive since this is a scheme recently

446
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,890
out of beta built around open standards

447
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,230
and the security does appear to be on

448
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,930
par when we look at UTS but if you take

449
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,480
a little bit of a closer look the

450
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,620
security model and associated threats I

451
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,900
think there are potentially some

452
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,090
benefits that we see so security focused

453
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,860
research has identified a problem when

454
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,689
it comes to plugging in your security

455
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,909
token you're essentially mounting an i/o

456
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,250
device Android security keys seem to

457
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,050
remove this attack vector by keeping the

458
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,940
Authenticator in the client separate and

459
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,980
using an extension to the C tap protocol

460
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,470
to provide first-time secure Bluetooth

461
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,540
communication additionally because

462
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,470
they're using this new and not

463
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,440
well-documented

464
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:59,040
extension to C tap the cloud assisted

465
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,420
ble of Google we're actually potentially

466
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,220
improving things further we're no longer

467
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,940
pairing and so you don't get system-wide

468
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,920
access and

469
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,490
you don't get your problems with

470
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,900
proximity ideally where does that leave

471
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,910
us add to my mind there are a few

472
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,010
avenues for further investigation first

473
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,680
we need to formally verify the benefits

474
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,290
associated with cable additionally we

475
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,970
want to look at the extent to which the

476
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,960
authentication protocol implemented is

477
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,090
limiting the ability to link users if we

478
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,650
get colluding third parties this is

479
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,480
something that we could additionally do

480
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,430
with any photo compliant key where I

481
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,780
think arguably there's only K unlink

482
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,390
ability when you look at the attestation

483
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,280
scheme at present the majority of

484
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,080
Android handsets also lack a secure

485
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,000
hardware element like a Titan M chip

486
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,149
which means you're dealing with a soft

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,460
key for your proof of presence and that

488
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,350
again gives us another attack surface so

489
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,140
the the cost benefit of doing that could

490
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,300
probably be be modeled the developers of

491
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,970
Android security keys have suggested

492
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,409
that if you want to avoid lock out if

493
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,240
you want to get around some of the

494
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,460
issues that you might have with

495
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,470
accessibility or interoperability the

496
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,630
best thing to do is to have a backup USB

497
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,400
security key which to me seems to defeat

498
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,650
the purpose a little bit so I think it

499
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,060
might also be an interesting thing to do

500
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,460
when we're able to see additional

501
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,899
relying parties use this scheme which I

502
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,120
think will be coming in the near future

503
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,760
to do some usability studies and see if

504
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,540
in the wild if these things actually

505
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,400
result in a usability issue so that's

506
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,100
about all I have time for quick and

507
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,570
painless if you want to pitch questions

508
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,760
to me today I'd be happy to talk

509
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,310
afterward you can email me if you want

510
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,720
to talk about potential collaborations

511
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,250
or you want to unpack some of these

512
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,110
things further or look at my paper from

513
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,710
the way workshop yesterday which expands

514
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,709
on some of these ideas

515
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,500
[Applause]

516
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,350
okay you guys did an excellent job I I

517
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,820

518
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,709

519
