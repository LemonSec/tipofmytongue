1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,210
I love everybody my name is Aaron this

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,500
is my co-author Sarah

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,900
we are from Carnegie Mellon University

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,860
and we're here to tell you why people

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,479
don't use password managers effectively

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,550
before I start our presentation I just

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,050
want to ask the audience how many of you

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,810
are currently using a password manager

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,340
please raise your hand if you do Wow I

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,320
see a lot of hands raised that is

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,530
fantastic we're doing so much better

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,329
than the average Americans well this is

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,290
not so surprising we are this group who

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:44,120
are really keen on security and privacy

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,160
passwords are indispensable to people's

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,440
online lives art there's a lot of

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,089
articles in the news media and many

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,070
security professionals that recommend

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,870
password manager software as the best

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,429
way to store and create a random

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,849
generated password for each of your

22
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:02,449
account but despite all these efforts

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,280
the adoption rates remained low the Pew

24
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,580
Research Center conducted a survey on

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,040
2016 asking how Americans are keeping

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,289
track of their passwords and their

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,570
results showed that only 18% are you

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,360
saving their passwords internet browsers

29
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,149
and only 12% are using a password

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,820
management program and the amount is 12%

31
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,450
merely 3% are using it as their primary

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:30,949
met method so password managers have

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,720
been around for more than 10 years we at

34
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,030
the researchers really wanted to know

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,820
why aren't people using them despite all

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,130
the benefits the prior work tried to

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,460
answer this question using free response

38
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,100
questions in surveys the term password

39
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,229
managers are usually left undefined

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,939
leaving it to participants own

41
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,340
interpretations but we do think it is

42
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,529
important to distinguish the built-in

43
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,450
password managers like the password

44
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,579
saving features in chrome and keychain

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,469
versus the several install password

46
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,399
managers like one password and key

47
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:06,949
password because and LastPass and key

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,169
pass because password can show that

49
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,680
people use those tools differently

50
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:16,250
there's a study in music last year by

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,410
Lithonia which show that people users of

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,629
built-in password tend to reuse their

53
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,000
password more and use weak passwords

54
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,359
than users of several install tools like

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,090
one

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,190
password but there were not a lot of

57
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,470
work trying to explore why that is the

58
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,170
case so which leads to us or a second

59
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,630
research question among existing users

60
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,809
of password managers why aren't using

61
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,490
them in effectively so here when we

62
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,950
mentioned any Factory we're talking

63
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,160
about people just conveniently stored

64
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,530
there or we can reuse password in the

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,650
past in the past managers where they

66
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:55,880
pick a week and reused password as their

67
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,830
master password so our work is

68
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,590
influenced by stubborn Biddle's

69
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,080
paper on the password lifecycle so we

70
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,630
conducted 37 instructor interviews as

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,459
those interviews give us the flexibility

72
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,489
to go into details when needed

73
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,230
especially people tend to have complex

74
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,920
and different password management habits

75
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,738
and choices so we spend a lot of time

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,988
developing interview scripts which is

77
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,200
based on nine pilot interviews with real

78
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,630
participants each interview takes about

79
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,970
one hour and participants or paid thirty

80
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,590
dollars for it

81
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,750
saronite applied inductive coding to the

82
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,760
interview transcriptions so the

83
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,920
interview contain questions related to

84
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,220
the general usage of their internet

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,410
accounts and passwords the strategies

86
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,200
for password creation and composition

87
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,090
their participants password management

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
habits their attitudes regarding

89
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,709
password measurement and generation

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,209
tools as well as their experience with

91
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:58,850
account compromise so we apply purposive

92
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,489
sampling for recruitment and to ensure

93
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,109
that we have participants with a variety

94
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,299
of different password management

95
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,420
strategies as well as with different

96
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:11,239
occupations so we ended up with three

97
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,250
types of users the first group contains

98
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,250
nine individuals who do not use any

99
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,260
password specific tools there are twelve

100
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,500
who use tools that built into browsers

101
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,860
for operating systems seven participants

102
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,900
reported using several install tools

103
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,370
there are two auto users with unusual

104
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,760
strategies that are difficult to

105
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,760
categorize

106
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,289
among the group of users who do not use

107
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,480
any tools instead

108
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,230
some simply memorize password in their

109
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,660
heads some write down passwords or hints

110
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:47,080
their passwords on notebook or post-it

111
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,030
knows next to their computers more some

112
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,219
people are more organized they store a

113
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,530
list of all of their online passwords in

114
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,220
an encrypted computer files like a work

115
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,320
document or a dot txt file some prefer

116
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,000
to have their passwords on the go so

117
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,000
they store their lists in a note-taking

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,150
app on their smartphones and others

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,520
apply more ad hoc methods like sending

120
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,070
themselves voicemails or emails

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,469
containing their passwords and some just

122
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,360
give up remembering their own passwords

123
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,120
they usually have their accounts logged

124
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,410
in and just repeatedly resetting their

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,450
passwords when needed so amount these

126
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,660
participants their password habits are

127
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,820
generally very risky there are seven who

128
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,260
pretty much used the same password for

129
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,570
all of their accounts with slight

130
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,289
modifications like a different symbol

131
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,020
number and there's one participant who

132
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,190
do not use full passwords but heavily

133
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,280
reused substrings

134
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,020
and there's one who had mostly unique

135
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,929
passwords but the passwords were very

136
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,510
simple usually in the form of a word

137
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:58,390
plus a number which therefore highly

138
00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:00,010
guessable so when we ask people in this

139
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,260
group what they think of their current

140
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,349
way of managing their passwords many of

141
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,840
them are not satisfied some wish for a

142
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,690
solution and they were not aware of

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,250
existing password management tools

144
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,080
there's one participant who carries

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,590
around a print out list of all of her

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,450
nighty passwords in her purse with her

147
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,700
she said I really wish there was an

148
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:25,539
easier way to remember passwords like a

149
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,030
universal type of system many complain

150
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,340
about having problems accessing accounts

151
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,349
especially when they are away from their

152
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,830
notes or they do not have their lists

153
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,960
handy some participants think their

154
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,270
current methods are very disorganized

155
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,150
and some mentioned how they lack the

156
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,250
ability to organize their password

157
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,719
alphabetically or by category it seems

158
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,540
that some features of password managers

159
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
like syncing or sorting can be

160
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,420
extremely appealing through the to some

161
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,630
people in this group so we identified

162
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,360
the following barriers of bullying

163
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,219
barriers to adopting password tools the

164
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,410
first is like I said in a previous slide

165
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,660
people not aware of options

166
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,630
some people just simply do not know that

167
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,790
those tools existed and the second

168
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,520
barrier is that some people do not

169
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:18,280
understand where the prompts asking to

170
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,919
save their passwords come from when they

171
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,289
see the prompt they they are wondering

172
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,610
who is asking me is it the website the

173
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:29,650
browser or or my computer and there's

174
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,800
also some confusion about the remember

175
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,770
me option on the website some people

176
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,960
think by clicking this option the

177
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,969
browser would remember their passwords

178
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,650
but when they found out their passwords

179
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,690
were not saved they think that this

180
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,880
function is not working as expected

181
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,010
therefore losing trust in the browser's

182
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,360
ability to save their spot to save their

183
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:54,310
passwords some people who do not use

184
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,890
project tools because they think they do

185
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,380
not have enough to protect either they

186
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,969
do not have enough online accounts or

187
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,280
they think that their accounts are not

188
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,640
valuable enough to require tools I think

189
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,809
there are a small fish in a big pond and

190
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,030
for people who are more familiar with

191
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,550
passive managers there are various

192
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,859
concerns about the security of them

193
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,200
they're not sure whether with it whether

194
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,910
they can trust the tool especially when

195
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,000
there's not from a well-known company

196
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,800
and there they are also wondering what

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,900
will happen to their passwords or who

198
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,620
will have access to their passwords once

199
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,560
they adopt the tools a single point of

200
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,090
faith failure is another big concern

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,179
they're worried about storing all of

202
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,830
their passwords in one place if the

203
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,839
hacker gets access to their password

204
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,180
manager the hacker would have access to

205
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,980
all of their passwords some are also

206
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,260
afraid of losing or forgetting their

207
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,130
master password therefore losing access

208
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,080
to all of their passwords some

209
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,689
participant who tried but had negative

210
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,820
power experienced with the tools were

211
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,670
reluctant to use them again

212
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,190
there's one participant she recalled

213
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:13,569
losing passwords door in her work

214
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:16,660
after the IT team updated her browser so

215
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:18,759
we also interviewed 12 people who are

216
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,219
using built-in password management tools

217
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,860
that includes password saving features

218
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,410
in the browser like in Google Chrome and

219
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,170
it also includes tools built into

220
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,600
operating systems for example apples

221
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,910
keychain functionality and in many cases

222
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,399
those two types of tools are integrated

223
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,040
so a user for example might save a

224
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,620
password in Safari and that password

225
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,500
might then be propagated through iCloud

226
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:49,569
keychain to their other Mac OS and iOS

227
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,339
devices among these users the password

228
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:54,009
habits were generally also pretty

229
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:57,040
insecure about half of them reported

230
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,079
heavy reuse of passwords and many of the

231
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,649
others reported strategies to mitigate

232
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,779
password reuse they knew that reusing

233
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,509
the same password for every single site

234
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,300
was not a good idea but they didn't know

235
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,920
a way to actually have unique passwords

236
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,680
for all sites so they would do things

237
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,360
like reusing passwords and tiers maybe

238
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,120
they had a strong password that they

239
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,310
used for important accounts like bank

240
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,779
accounts and then they had weaker

241
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,359
passwords that they were used on other

242
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,220
types of sites and in some cases they

243
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,899
would have a unique password for

244
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,730
important accounts but they would have a

245
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:34,180
throwaway password for accounts that

246
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,730
they considered less important only one

247
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,969
user made an effort to have unique and

248
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,100
randomly generated passwords for all of

249
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,630
her newly created accounts and she was a

250
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,389
special case - we'll come back to her in

251
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,670
a moment

252
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:51,939
among these users they did overall think

253
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,949
that these browser and operating system

254
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:56,110
based tools were really convenient

255
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:58,870
everyone loved autofill they said

256
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,579
autofill is awesome on the other hand

257
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,860
they were often afraid of other people

258
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:06,160
having access to their saved passwords

259
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,339
and especially they were concerned about

260
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,500
other users of their devices and other

261
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,899
people with physical access to their

262
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,680
computers so we heard a lot of stories

263
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,270
for example about worrying about case

264
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,910
ordering things from parents and Mazon

265
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:24,569
accounts that's scary when you know that

266
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,670
the kids can get into your stuff almost

267
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,940
all of these users adopted these tools

268
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,709
due to seeing prompts and due to general

269
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,900
concerns of convenience

270
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,120
none of them told us I started saving my

271
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,069
passwords in Google Chrome because I

272
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,600
thought that was the more secure thing

273
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,020
to do and that was the most important

274
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,940
thing to me they said things like it

275
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,650
just kind of popped up and it sounded

276
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:54,570
much easier so we examine barriers to

277
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:56,430
using these tools effectively and one of

278
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,260
the main things we found was that a lack

279
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,750
of experience with account compromise

280
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:04,110
was keeping people from for example

281
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,180
using the password generation features

282
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,760
and the browser-based tools that do

283
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,829
offer that option many of them knew that

284
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,480
their habits were not secure but they

285
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,240
didn't think they would change them

286
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,490
unless something bad happen to them one

287
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,020
person told us sometimes we humans need

288
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,160
to get kicked in the ass before we

289
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,430
realize that we need to do things

290
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,620
differently some of them just had a lack

291
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,140
of awareness or knowledge of password

292
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,000
management and best practices a lot like

293
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,150
the users who weren't using any password

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,270
management tools and some of them had

295
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:39,600
also considered using third-party or

296
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:41,579
separately installed tools to you know

297
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,140
have more secure password habits but

298
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,260
they were worried about using a tool

299
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,000
from an unfamiliar company so I

300
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,370
mentioned we would come back to the user

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,740
who was actually generating unique

302
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,730
passwords in a browser she was using

303
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,400
Safari so she was an example of someone

304
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,100
who previously had not had secured

305
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,329
password habits because she just didn't

306
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,520
think it was worth it until something

307
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,310
bad happened to her and then something

308
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,500
did so on Thanksgiving she was having

309
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,619
dinner with her family and she got a

310
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,840
call from Macy's that someone had tried

311
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,820
to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of

312
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,070
shoes or something along those lines

313
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,140
from her accounts and then she got a

314
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,850
call from her bank that one of her cards

315
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,720
had been compromised and then she got

316
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,800
another call from a bank and it turned

317
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,809
out what had happened was she

318
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,599
pattern Macy's account compromised and

319
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,368
she was using that password for tons of

320
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,920
other websites including multiple bank

321
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:40,720
accounts and she said it was awful so

322
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,179
I'm having to get a new debit card for

323
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,399
everything having to get new credit

324
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:47,110
cards it was just terrible and that's

325
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,360
when I changed every single password

326
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,160
that I had two random digits so this

327
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,290
kind of experience seems to be powerful

328
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,670
but it would really be better if people

329
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,519
didn't have to have this kind of

330
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,628
experience to start using more secure

331
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,459
practices we also interviewed seven

332
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,829
people who were using separately

333
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,839
installed password management tools so

334
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:10,959
those are tools that are not built into

335
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,279
browsers or operating systems tools that

336
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,859
must be installed as separate

337
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,449
applications or browser extensions so

338
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,809
those are the tools like one password

339
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:22,920
and LastPass and we also interviewed one

340
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:26,230
user of KeePass which is open source

341
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,628
among these users as we might expect

342
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,089
from past work their password habits

343
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,100
were more secure overall all of them use

344
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:37,360
randomly generated passwords for newly

345
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,160
created accounts and most of them used

346
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,709
unique passwords for newly created

347
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,569
accounts there was one user who still

348
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,118
didn't trust the tool to remember his

349
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:47,829
password so he had several different

350
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:51,790
randomly generated passwords that he

351
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:54,729
reused all but one of them used a unique

352
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,829
master password some of them used pass

353
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,019
phrases and some of them used randomly

354
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,179
generated ones but it sounded like most

355
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:05,350
of them had reasonably strong master

356
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:08,829
passwords among these users as we might

357
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,139
expect there were a lot of positives one

358
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,998
user told us I can have very long very

359
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,040
complicated passwords for every single

360
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:17,199
website I use but I only have to

361
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,540
remember one so they did like being able

362
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,959
to generate random and unique passwords

363
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:25,860
without having to memorize them many of

364
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,569
them also liked syncing and portability

365
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,259
although some of them were concerned

366
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:33,579
that that was a security risk some of

367
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:35,230
them also mentioned that they liked

368
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,939
being able to have their passwords on

369
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,149
the go and have access their password

370
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:41,469
manager on their phone on the other hand

371
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,000
many of them reported

372
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,840
usability and

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,470
ability issues one of them just told us

374
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:53,380
the app sucks she said that the password

375
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,600
manager worked okay in her browser on

376
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,240
her computer but she found the app

377
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,610
incredibly frustrating because she felt

378
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,500
that it would sometimes suggest a

379
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,940
password for a different website when

380
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,830
she was trying to log into another

381
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,670
website and she just found it really

382
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:12,190
difficult to use and that was pretty

383
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,140
prevalent among these users they would

384
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,640
say things like well it saves passwords

385
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,560
the user experience is frustrating they

386
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,460
also reported that initial setup was a

387
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,680
lot of work so people would have a

388
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,450
really hard time going from having

389
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,430
passwords that they were storing some

390
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,310
other way in many cases passwords that

391
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,189
were reused and having to spend hours or

392
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,380
days transferring all of those passwords

393
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,070
into the new tool and in many cases

394
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,720
generating new passwords some of them

395
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,670
also worried about forgetting their

396
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,920
master passwords and some of them just

397
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,449
lived with that worry but some of them

398
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,400
chose to do things that might not have

399
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,040
been very secure including one person

400
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:58,990
who kept her saved all the time in an

401
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:01,959
email draft so why are password manager

402
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,120
adoption rates so low and what could we

403
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,589
do about it

404
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,400
first of all there's a lack of awareness

405
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,379
of password management tools and many

406
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,079
users also don't think they're at very

407
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,250
high risk of account compromised we

408
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,369
think that there's plenty of room for

409
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,199
more advertising and education many

410
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,829
users also mentioned to us that one of

411
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,959
their main sources of information about

412
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:28,000
password best practices was the

413
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,130
guidelines on the password creation page

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,770
on a website so that might be a place

415
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,010
where users could be nudged to do things

416
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,260
like using a password management tool

417
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,990
and we also did confirm here that

418
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,180
browser prompts tend to nudge people to

419
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,190
choose better password practical

420
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,790
practices as long as those nudges make

421
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,950
sense to users it also seems that it

422
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,560
would be important to emphasize useful

423
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,360
features some of these users are never

424
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,500
going to have security as their primary

425
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,590
concern

426
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,770
convenience is going to win for many of

427
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,439
these users but given that we had users

428
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,330
for example who really liked storing

429
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,820
their passwords in a file because they

430
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,800
could alphabetize it or sort it by

431
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,450
category we should let these users know

432
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,180
that in many cases a password manager

433
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:20,890
can do things like that and can do it

434
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,740
with even more power confusing prompts

435
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,810
we're also an issue that caused people

436
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,570
to not trust password management tools

437
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,399
or not understand them so it's important

438
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,310
to do research with non expert users to

439
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,990
identify those points of confusion and

440
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,450
to improve website interfaces and

441
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,020
browser prompts so that people trust

442
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,330
those tools usability and reliability

443
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,670
problems were an issue it's important to

444
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,520
do usability testing with non expert

445
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,320
users and in particular we need to do

446
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:56,740
more long term studies to reveal edge

447
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:58,720
cases because when users when a password

448
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,030
manager essentially remembers passwords

449
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,620
on most web sites but users find it

450
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,240
doesn't work on certain websites they

451
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,360
stopped trusting it and they resort to

452
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,490
less secure practices and why don't

453
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,850
people use password managers effectively

454
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,770
and what can we do users of built-in

455
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,770
tools often prioritize convenience over

456
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:20,530
security we should improve the

457
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,020
reliability of these tools so that users

458
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,970
trust them and then we can nudge users

459
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,800
to generate passwords but they're

460
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,840
unlikely to do this in built-in tools

461
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,750
until they trust the tool to reliably

462
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,429
retrieve their passwords and users have

463
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,050
separately installed tools seem to have

464
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,450
better outcomes but they still show

465
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,220
risky behavior sometimes and the main

466
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,620
places where that might be able to be

467
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,050
addressed are streamlining the initial

468
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,500
setup because we have some users who

469
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,360
reported they just gave up there and

470
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,700
help users create memorize and

471
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,100
understand how to store their master

472
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,530
passwords in a safe way so that they

473
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,750
don't resort resort to insecure

474
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,110
practices or just give up at that step

475
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:04,720
so deterrence - password manager

476
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,330
adoption include lack of awareness risk

477
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,550
assessment issues confusing prompts and

478
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,220
usability and reliability issue

479
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,470
and effective use of password managers

480
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,600
requires usability and convenience

481
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:25,859
especially for built-in tools thank you

482
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:25,859
[Applause]

483
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,280
thank you so much for doing this I mean

484
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:37,650
just just just keep it up you know this

485
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:42,190
is fantastic I some of the

486
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:46,530
recommendations that you gave our at

487
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:50,400
least have been for us contradictory the

488
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:54,760
streamline set up we find out a barrier

489
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,570
we used to have things doing set up to

490
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,950
help people memorize shoes you know and

491
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:05,800
and and learn

492
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:08,110
good master passwords hmm and and you

493
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:16,300
know see so we found we've had to choose

494
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:19,629
between those two in many ways thank you

495
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,639
thank you it's a difficult problem yeah

496
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,190
we identified problems and we know we

497
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,740
don't have solutions for all of them hi

498
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,350
bakka from UBC thank you so much for

499
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,990
this this was quite interesting I was

500
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,639
wondering if you did a comparison if

501
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,230
there are differences between the

502
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,480
reasons why people don't use password

503
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,700
managers and the Soviets directly exist

504
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,120
were there any differences between those

505
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,720
reasons I did this one in many cases

506
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,080
what we found confirmed and added detail

507
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,810
to some of that past work one of the

508
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,370
things that we think was novel were

509
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,950
these issues that multiple people

510
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,080
reported about being confused about

511
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,850
where password manager prompts come from

512
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,149
like thinking the website was trying to

513
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,649
save their password as well as issues

514
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,150
with thinking that the remember me

515
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,430
function on a website was somehow

516
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,890
related to a password manager but in

517
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:14,500
many other cases we were just confirming

518
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,250
and adding more depth to what people had

519
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,250
observed before

520
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:24,329
thank you for a good talk a vast receipt

521
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:25,498
from the University of Bristol I thought

522
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,928
it was quite interesting to see the

523
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:30,689
different contrasts but I also wondered

524
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,309
if you saw any practices where users

525
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:35,249
didn't actually fall into those three

526
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:37,049
neat categories so for instance did you

527
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:39,209
see people who for example are using

528
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,579
browser-based password managers also

529
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:43,199
then using some of the other practices

530
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:47,819
of the users that actually don't use

531
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:49,739
anything yeah and here we categorize

532
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,509
users based on what their primary

533
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:53,669
strategy was but there were certainly

534
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:55,679
people across all of these groups who

535
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:58,619
were using a mix of strategies and at

536
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,029
least some cases and we also as we

537
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:02,309
mentioned had a couple of users that

538
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:04,259
were doing something completely

539
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:06,389
different that they categorized as a

540
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,509
security by obscurity approach that we

541
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:10,948
didn't even get into so it would be it

542
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:14,399
would be interesting to know if people

543
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:16,079
were using mixed strategy yes well their

544
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,998
strategies which were for more secure

545
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,079
things that they perceive more secure

546
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:22,489
and then there are things where they

547
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,779
don't care and they do things like that

548
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:26,399
and there's a little bit about that in

549
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,779
the paper but I agree there's probably

550
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:30,508
something interesting there in terms of

551
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,129
how people decide what strategy to use

552
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,899
for some accounts versus using a

553
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:36,869
different strategy for other accounts

554
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:38,428
okay thank you yeah and I just want to

555
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:41,458
add a little to that is that the first

556
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,529
group tend to have more they tend to

557
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:45,389
apply more methods than like you know

558
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,679
the last group lots of em they just use

559
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,299
the third party and they don't need to

560
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,399
use anything else but for the first

561
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:52,709
group they tend to apply a variety of

562
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,988
different like some keep their passwords

563
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:57,959
on a note or some just use Prager to

564
00:23:54,989 --> 00:24:01,669
save it so they tend to use more mixed

565
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:05,090
methods than mmm-hmm the last group

566
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:10,140
thank you okay thank you

567
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,139
[Applause]
