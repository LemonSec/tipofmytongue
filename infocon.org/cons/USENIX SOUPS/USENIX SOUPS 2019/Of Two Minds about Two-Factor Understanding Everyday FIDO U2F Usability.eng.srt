1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:16,789
okay I'm gonna present the first of two

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,839
papers about two fact

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:24,679
straight into it so two-factor

4
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:27,168
authentication is seen as a good

5
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:31,429
solution for protecting against account

6
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:34,010
hijacking the stealing of credentials

7
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:37,190
for online accounts and so we're seeing

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,979
increasing use of two-factor having two

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,280
separate kinds of authentication in both

10
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:45,350
personal consumer accounts and in

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,189
corporate services as well

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,820
it is typically in the form of having

13
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:53,809
passwords we've heard a lot about

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,659
passwords already and and something you

15
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:59,599
have not just something you know and

16
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,759
this is commonly a one-time code that

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,309
you you would receive in a text message

18
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,799
to your personal phone that being the

19
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,740
something you have essentially and

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,759
that's effectively emerged in an ad hoc

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,679
way but we're seeing kind of standards

22
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,860
protocols emerging such as the fast

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,790
identity online Fido alliance where

24
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:26,539
there's an intention to support more

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:29,930
kind of universal security keys as part

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,240
of the u2f protocol and so we're already

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,280
seeing that this is supported by more

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,830
than 30 services so we've got the

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,330
popular ones there some of them Dropbox

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:43,310
Facebook Google and the like and as I

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,470
said the the intention there is to have

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,840
one key that you can use for all of your

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,820
services not so much relying on your

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,240
phone as this kind of ad-hoc solution

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,669
and so we have been exploring the

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,280
usability issues of security keys not

37
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,860
just within setup and login you know

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,049
those first formative steps of using one

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,628
of these devices but also real world use

40
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:12,590
day-to-day so as I said the security

41
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:15,260
keys will be something that you have and

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,989
it's intended as that second factor

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,230
it'll be a unique Hardware token that

44
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:24,889
you have so another thing you would

45
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,230
carry around with you and the keys that

46
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:31,629
we're looking at are those which insert

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,629
into the USB port of a computer

48
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,720
and so there is this process being set

49
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,569
up here where if a service asks you to

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,480
authenticate there's already this need

51
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,310
to even have the key nearby kind of

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,429
almost preempt that you're going to need

53
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,870
it locate the key whereas you might know

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,959
where your phone is you might have in

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,580
your pocket or your bag there there's a

56
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,980
need to habituate where you know where

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,330
your your security key is as well and

58
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,940
enter that into the USB port and then

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,519
activate it so the but the security keys

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,200
we looked at in our study have buttons

61
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,150
on them that would need to be pressed

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,359
and we'll explore some of the issues

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,170
with this seemingly simple function

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,329
shortly and then you've got to remember

65
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,569
to actually remove it after you've

66
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:25,819
activated it and and proceed with the

67
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,310
service so just to put that in concrete

68
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:32,238
terms these are our contenders here

69
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:36,920
we've got on the left the or the far

70
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,480
side from me I guess the the II pass we

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,660
have the secure click in the middle

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,959
which has two parts to it one which is a

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,889
USB bridge and one which is the

74
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:51,739
dedicated button there and we have the

75
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:53,450
Yubikey on on the side here as well the

76
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,030
very small one so already we can see

77
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,660
that yes they're all called security

78
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,620
keys they all say they have buttons but

79
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,620
they can actually be quite different

80
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,920
and then also thinking about the the

81
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,059
background to the use of security keys

82
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,089
there are barriers to adoption which

83
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,738
still remain which is one reason why we

84
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:22,410
have focused on setup there's no way of

85
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:26,229
getting away essentially from the

86
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,420
potential of losing these things similar

87
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,130
to the potential for losing a master

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,030
password for a password manager as was

89
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:36,010
discussed and there's also this sense of

90
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,679
what is the perceived utility of a

91
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,080
security key when services already

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:46,230
support SMS and OTP codes to your phone

93
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,229
so already there there are these

94
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,580
persistent issues of convenience

95
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,540
personal ownership another thing to look

96
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,940
after and then also having that prior

97
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,310
experience as with other dedicated

98
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,620
security tools and applications knowing

99
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,700
already how they work and and how to use

100
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:09,190
them effectively and we see that prior

101
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,870
studies have focused on on these

102
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,540
security keys being deployed in a

103
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,490
managed environment such as when you're

104
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,890
doing your online banking the bank may

105
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,890
provide you with a key or we've seen

106
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,349
cases in universities as well and other

107
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,030
organizations where there's an IT team

108
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,740
they may look after it they may

109
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,960
configure it and ensure that it works

110
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,140
with the services that you're going to

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,049
be using in that environment but even

112
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,830
then it can change the way you actually

113
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,740
interact with your primary tasks so

114
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:45,219
we're trying to really get ahead of this

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,570
need to support user centricity and

116
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:53,080
actually consider for consumer services

117
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,030
where the consumer and the consumer

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,609
service may not necessarily know each

119
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,669
other in advance how can we support that

120
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,700
decentralization of services and ensure

121
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:07,810
that there is interoperability between

122
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:11,830
these keys and the services and so we

123
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:15,310
explored this by looking firstly at the

124
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,409
set up and login these these almost

125
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:23,210
mundane first tasks of using a secure

126
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:27,889
in a lab a study and then built on that

127
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:31,250
by having participants use a security

128
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,169
key every day for for a week just to see

129
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,250
how it works with their experiences of

130
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:39,380
using personal services such as their

131
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:45,560
personal email and their social media

132
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:47,810
accounts logging into those so for the

133
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,510
lab based study we had 15 participants

134
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,210
who came into our lab we had two

135
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,490
conditions we had pre-prepared accounts

136
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,190
our pilot study showed that were

137
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,300
actually having the participants use

138
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:05,000
both of these services together could be

139
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:10,220
a bit of a fatigue for them so we split

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,590
them into two conditions and here we we

141
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,380
had a within subjects approach we were

142
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,359
comparing three the three security keys

143
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,190
that I brought up earlier with

144
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,970
essentially what is the incumbent the

145
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:25,960
these text messages to your phone

146
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,820
because there's not just how do these

147
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,039
keys work on their own what what else

148
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:35,030
are they competing against when we think

149
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,969
about the perceived utility and so as I

150
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,280
say we were focusing very much on the

151
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,830
set up and rolling one of these keys

152
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,590
with a web service and logging into it

153
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:51,760
and then talking about this with the

154
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:56,210
participants and so then comparing each

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,550
of the two factor methods for the

156
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,150
different services we were seeing if we

157
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:06,430
look at the bottom row the the SMS OTPs

158
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:09,950
that the the the login time was longer

159
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:14,810
than the others for instance and and

160
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:17,389
then the the Yubikey for instance it

161
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,450
took quite a while because there was a

162
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,190
there was participants waiting for

163
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,469
something to happen on wanting time to

164
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,150
wait and see what would happen and so

165
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,470
that hints at some of the issues that we

166
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:33,510
were were seeing coming up

167
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:37,159
and we were finding that almost no

168
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:40,650
surprise looking at the usability scale

169
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,099
responses that text messages were seen

170
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,160
as the the most usable perhaps because

171
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,600
they were the most familiar but then the

172
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,569
e-pass and the Yubikey

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,820
weren't that far behind the secure click

174
00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:00,540
with its with its two parts was was a

175
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,280
little lower than that and and then this

176
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,709
is where we start to see issues with

177
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,709
this decentralization this need for

178
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,500
interoperability is that most of the

179
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,680
participants needed actual guidance to

180
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,200
navigate the the web service interfaces

181
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,030
so it was interesting that if for

182
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,790
instance there was a kind of turning

183
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:23,040
circle or some kind of animation to

184
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,860
imply something was was supposed to be

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,349
happening this was perceived as as

186
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,660
something loading the service was doing

187
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,880
something when in fact it would be that

188
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,189
the service was prompting the user and

189
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,100
waiting for them to do something so that

190
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:44,010
was adding also to to the time

191
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:46,140
measurements and and again the some of

192
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,080
the persistent issues with with second

193
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,660
factors concerns about getting locked

194
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,930
out of an account if you were to lose

195
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,600
the key but also at the same time if we

196
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:01,079
think about the the time measurements

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,180
for an SMS code keys were helping to

198
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:08,010
mitigate that waiting for a text waiting

199
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,329
for a code in a text and and we'll get

200
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,680
into some of the issues around the

201
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:17,520
button as well so here the the button is

202
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,949
actually that gold bit in the middle in

203
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,360
this case and we'll try and identify the

204
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,020
buttons for each of them as we go and

205
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,310
and so one participant again thinking

206
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,949
about familiarity it's like a USB device

207
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,770
our I've used USB devices before that

208
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,589
feels familiar but then what we don't

209
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,839
see from this this front on perspective

210
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,339
is it's actually quite thin and so one

211
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,750
participant was concerned that it could

212
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,920
snap

213
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,319
and if that's how you get into your

214
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,319
accounts that's that's not gonna be

215
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:53,329
perceived as great but also challenges

216
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:56,000
in noticing the button here with the two

217
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:59,300
separate parts the button and the the

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,920
bridge the Bluetooth bridge for the

219
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,680
secure click participants needed

220
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,569
guidance to actually pair the two and

221
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,089
there was also a need to download a a

222
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:10,069
small application so we've seen with

223
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:13,180
with other talks issues with having to

224
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:16,939
download extra things and install them

225
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,519
then with the Yubikey problems finding

226
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:21,500
the button it's actually the bit at the

227
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,339
top there you touch it and that's the

228
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,250
button and there was potential to insert

229
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,740
it the wrong way around and it is

230
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,750
unusually small its size almost implies

231
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,509
that when you put it in the USB port it

232
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:39,459
stays there because you might not be

233
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:43,129
able to get it back out again and then

234
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:45,560
with the good old phone simply the time

235
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:51,439
needed to receive a text message and

236
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:54,170
type it in and then and and so we were

237
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:56,779
seeing their persistent usability issues

238
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,790
with two-factor but also these emerging

239
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,550
issues around the interoperability

240
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:04,849
between the keys and services so then we

241
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,949
focused on the secure click we we had

242
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:11,000
some of these we could provide to

243
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:14,508
participants and so we we did exactly

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,819
that we had 15 participants using a

245
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:18,170
secure click over a week they were

246
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,670
linking it with their actual personal

247
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,309
online accounts the accounts they care

248
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:26,089
about and they were reporting usage to

249
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:28,790
us with each use at the end of every day

250
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,579
and in a summary at the end of the week

251
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,649
and we found we were having to

252
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:36,620
pre-screen for active use of compatible

253
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:40,069
services there are many services which

254
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,579
support Fido but we were finding some

255
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:45,920
would work and some perhaps wouldn't so

256
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:47,300
we had to ensure that the participants

257
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,069
actually use some of the ones that we

258
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:54,559
knew would work and we were providing

259
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:56,929
facilities to to participants to report

260
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,089
their usage through email and whatsapp

261
00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:01,220
but also to let us know if they were

262
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:03,439
having any issues this this being access

263
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:08,059
to their personal accounts no issues

264
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:09,800
were reported which was a relief and so

265
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:13,040
getting to the results of that we

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,750
recorded hundreds of use entries where

267
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,179
this was across automatic login using a

268
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:23,209
password with the security key using a

269
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:26,600
password password with some other second

270
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:29,329
factor or for instance using just a

271
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,130
password on its own so this was very

272
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:33,979
much around the use of the service and

273
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:37,160
where the security key would fit in with

274
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,949
that where each participant were sorry

275
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,670
across participants we were seeing about

276
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:48,319
38 entries on average and also various

277
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,599
in various locations such as home and

278
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:53,569
the workplace and various devices as

279
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,170
well so perhaps a laptop a mobile device

280
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:58,459
and also public computers and we were

281
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,099
finding that the majority of

282
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:02,628
participants were carrying both the

283
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,649
secure click and bridge together with

284
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:08,420
them so not thinking to leave it

285
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:13,339
somewhere or try and anticipate when

286
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:16,839
they might use it and then here this is

287
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:20,240
a summary of what we found so we had

288
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,480
proportion of login events with the

289
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,209
percentages over the far side means

290
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,449
satisfaction and the day of the study

291
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,138
week at the bottom and so this line

292
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,240
chart

293
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,639
it was the sentiment it started quite

294
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,459
high perhaps everyone was excited it

295
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,120
took a few took a few dents along the

296
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:43,609
way but stayed quite high what was

297
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,970
interesting for us the gray section the

298
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,819
automatic logins were going up and up

299
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,100
and up over the week while the the empty

300
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:55,759
sections the password and the security

301
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,679
key were gradually going down so what we

302
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,889
found that it was the automatic login

303
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,299
was going up even though the

304
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,110
participants were expressing that they

305
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:11,160
were quite happy to use these these

306
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:14,610
keys and so why we found that was was

307
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,250
that jumping to the middle here that

308
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,380
remember me features seem to be on by

309
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,740
default with the services they were

310
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,870
using and also that the keys were almost

311
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,870
being rendered redundant by this always

312
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,430
on SMS even if you were wanting the

313
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,839
participants were wanting to use the

314
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,550
security keys they would still be asked

315
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:37,560
to provide a phone number and still get

316
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:39,060
a text at the same time and so the the

317
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,359
user selections of authentication were

318
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,369
not being persisted or respected and

319
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,079
that's why the final day usage was

320
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,760
dropping down even though another

321
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,069
measure of sentiment most of the

322
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,060
participants actually asked to keep the

323
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:55,860
secure click and took it with them and

324
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,839
and at the same time another another

325
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,459
measure of sentiment was that a lot of

326
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,230
the participants could actually envisage

327
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,229
specific uses of the keys

328
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,560
and so what we found was and looking at

329
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,589
persistent issues but also emerging

330
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,630
issues as well that the security key

331
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:25,660
setup wasn't necessarily efficient for

332
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,279
novice users there was almost a a

333
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,990
presumption that you knew how these

334
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:36,220
things worked and and knew that about

335
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,350
the little differences between them but

336
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,390
also as well interestingly in terms of

337
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,459
usability if you have an authentication

338
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,020
technology you'd hope to have a backup

339
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,390
in case you're your primary

340
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,660
authentication method fails but then

341
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:52,689
that starts to bring into question the

342
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:56,949
the utility and perceived utility of

343
00:16:52,690 --> 00:17:00,040
having a security key if you've also got

344
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,040
text messages for instance and so there

345
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,220
is not necessarily in any Universal

346
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,379
usage proposition for four keys where we

347
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,720
were considering well might this be a

348
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,010
means of bootstrapping the the

349
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,870
trustworthiness of our device and

350
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,900
looking to the diary study results we

351
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:22,059
were seeing that the behavior of the

352
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,329
services participants were using was

353
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:28,809
almost like a nudge away from keys

354
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,210
almost towards the authentication

355
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,210
approaches that that were managed by the

356
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,920
service that were familiar to to the

357
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,890
service and so that perception of a

358
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,750
utility was being eroded and success was

359
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,460
not relying necessarily on the key but

360
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,550
on the service that it was interacting

361
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:49,120
with and so we found that the user

362
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:52,659
journey was not was not perhaps usable

363
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,729
but wasn't guaranteed either which goes

364
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,860
against the sense of a standard where if

365
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,809
we're going to have a standard this

366
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,699
requires the stakeholders in the

367
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:05,649
ecosystem to be working together so that

368
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,540
services can understand devices and the

369
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:14,880
like in in this decentralized manner so

370
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,879
thank you and I'm open for questions

371
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:24,580
Alan Schurman from UMBC University of

372
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,100
Maryland Baltimore County have you

373
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,100
studied the Pico system or do you have

374
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,639
any comments about it which version of

375
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,500
it the the the top version the the

376
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,300
current or any version or the current

377
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:42,250
version the current version is a mobile

378
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:45,480
app I believe but but it used to be a

379
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:50,140
token and it used to be lots of tokens

380
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,520
well there are siblings yes for comments

381
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,950
generally or on something specifically

382
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,050
have you studied it I haven't studied it

383
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:01,360
no do you have any opinions about it it

384
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:07,389
seems to be another form of two-factor

385
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:09,370
authentication well they're fundamental

386
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:15,250
differences between it and the other

387
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:17,770
systems you studied I guess as it's

388
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,500
evolved it it appears to me to be

389
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:25,210
similar to these are the these are the

390
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,960
kinds of authentication perhaps we can

391
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,960
talk offline yeah

392
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,790
thanks for your talk I'm Connor starting

393
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,360
at UC Berkeley in your talk you

394
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,428
mentioned that you were helping users

395
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,370
get ready for the study and you provided

396
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:48,500
the security keys for them and a fair

397
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,750
number of them opted to keep the

398
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,280
security key at the end of the study one

399
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,350
of the big barriers that I see for

400
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,879
average consumers is actually purchasing

401
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,780
the key in the first place mm-hmm did

402
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,160
you get any insight into whether at the

403
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,920
end of this study people would have

404
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,710
looking back decided to purchase a key

405
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,580
or if they would purchase a backup key

406
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:13,640
moving forward I think what if I recall

407
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:16,600
what emerged from the these sessions in

408
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,610
both studies was this unfamiliar

409
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,678
familiarity with the tokens

410
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:26,419
almost I've not seen these before so

411
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,850
certainly it would seem it's not only a

412
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,650
case of how do I get one of these but

413
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,070
how are these tokens actually

414
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,900
represented in you know what where are

415
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,629
these opportunities for me to see these

416
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,660
things and consider using them which is

417
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,059
our Dodds at odds almost with these

418
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,270
tokens being available for purchase on

419
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,309
say Amazon and other popular sites so

420
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,320
they're there to be purchased but

421
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:53,899
they're not necessarily represented in

422
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,580
users everyday lives do you think people

423
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,450
would have spent money on their own

424
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,159
outside of the study well while with the

425
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,200
issues of perceived utility while

426
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,050
someone has a phone and that receives

427
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,940
text messages it would be an issue of

428
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,250
all what would I be

429
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,910
perhaps what am I paying for when I have

430
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,830
to factor so as I said with well as the

431
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,950
slide said there is this misperception

432
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,330
of there being more security but there's

433
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,280
a need to articulate well what is that

434
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:28,100
more security as opposed to what I'm

435
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,629
getting with SMS thanks so much thank

436
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:36,250
you very much for that I was just

437
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:39,050
wondering is there in terms of the non

438
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,600
physical token thing you looked at SMS

439
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:47,450
is there some particular reason you

440
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:49,750
didn't look at totp that's what what

441
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,190
sorry sorry that you didn't look at the

442
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:56,780
things like google authenticator the

443
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:59,270
time-based one-time password it was well

444
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,950
then it was I guess it would almost got

445
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,720
a bit distracting having all of it was

446
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,940
we were already pushing it a bit with

447
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,559
having a lot so is it that's perfectly

448
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,160
fine answer you know I was just

449
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,500
wondering it was it was really this we

450
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,809
found in in prior research as well as

451
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,730
there's a need to kind of think about

452
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:29,110
what did what do we want to test but

453
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:33,620
what is already existing so I appreciate

454
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,969
something that appreciate what he said

455
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,799
that they use the selection of

456
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,710
authentication meant that wasn't

457
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,379
persisted or respected I was just

458
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:46,400
wondering whether you summarized which

459
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,090
services offered security keys as the

460
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,970
second factor as a standalone method and

461
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:56,149
whether you found out from the users if

462
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,480
they would opt you to have on you hmm

463
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:03,710
a security keys as a second factor

464
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,750
rather than choose more than like second

465
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,990
factor and SMS is a complementary in

466
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:11,090
case they're afraid to use the key well

467
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:16,370
there is that persistent concern of

468
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:19,039
losing the key but then it's yeah I

469
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,479
guess it's as I said it's the you could

470
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,390
choose the key but then you had to

471
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,520
choose a backup so we weren't able to

472
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:30,200
necessarily directly look at that where

473
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,720
which may have influenced the results is

474
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,880
they were participants for going and

475
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,039
trying out the key but there would be a

476
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,929
backup and but also we were a backup as

477
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,799
well essentially was there an option to

478
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,450
opt out of the backup not that I'm aware

479
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,120
of

480
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:50,300
would you recommend that

481
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,870
in terms in terms of protecting the user

482
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:56,180
you'd hope that there would be some

483
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,010
recovery if they were to lose their

484
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,890
primary means of authentication but then

485
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:03,260
it is that question of what does that

486
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,620
impact the the utility and perceived

487
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:10,640
utility of this this dedicated security

488
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,248
token thank you thank you

489
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,249
[Applause]
