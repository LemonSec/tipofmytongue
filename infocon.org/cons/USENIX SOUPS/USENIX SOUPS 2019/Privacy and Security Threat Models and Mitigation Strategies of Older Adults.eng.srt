1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,469
we'll talk about the privacy security

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,840
threat models and mitigation strategies

3
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:20,080
of another underrepresented population

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,279
of online users namely older adults this

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,278
is the work that we conducted together

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,300
with wonderful colleagues from various

7
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,400
institutions so probably most of you

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,259
know that prior work has found that

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,850
older adults often expressed very

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,360
fine-grain and very heterogeneous

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,250
concerns about privacy and security and

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,739
you do limited technical literacy and

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,350
experience as well as declining physical

14
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,239
and mental abilities older adults can be

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,460
less aware and therefore more zzz's

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,800
captive susceptible to those privacy and

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,450
security risks however for some reason

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,239
older adults are still underrepresented

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,110
in privacy and security research so to

20
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,510
fill that gap

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,239
our research goal was to inform the

22
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,640
design of effective system that would

23
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,009
empower older adults to make informed

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,649
decisions to have better control and

25
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:11,979
over their personal data and to maintain

26
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:13,899
better security practices online so to

27
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,270
this end we conducted semi-structured

28
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:18,849
interviews with 46 english-speaking

29
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,420
older adults recruited among inhabitants

30
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:24,310
of senior facilities residences for

31
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,160
seniors as well as members of senior

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,069
centers in San Francisco Bay Area we

33
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,640
screened out individuals that had severe

34
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:36,759
cognitive impairments and the eventual

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,550
sample of our participants was comprised

36
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,239
of people of aged between 65 and 95

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,209
years old

38
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,599
more than half lived alone most an

39
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,610
independent mainstream housing 80% had

40
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,830
neither heard nor informal caregivers

41
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,479
and the majority were well-educated

42
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,580
however they were diverse in terms of

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,170
income health and technology experience

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,239
using thematic analysis we identified

45
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,970
some common security and privacy

46
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:07,239
concerns and their fret mottos

47
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,340
altered all right models risk mitigation

48
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,349
and data management strategies a

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,170
usability issue with the currently

50
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:16,238
deployed deployed protection mechanisms

51
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,160
they're learning and troubleshooting

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,430
approaches and misconceptions about

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,590
security and privacy we found that for

54
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,660
the most part the threat models and

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,360
misconceptions that came up during our

56
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,420
interviews were quite similar to what

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,080
has been found for general population

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,599
anticipating the question what is

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,500
different and you can find the detailed

60
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,268
report on those matters in the paper for

61
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,769
the sake of time in this presentation I

62
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:45,459
will focus only on a couple of issues

63
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:48,040
that look different for older adults so

64
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,590
starting from the threat models the

65
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,840
first issue that we identified was

66
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,900
information collection in senior care

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,910
and there are two main traders that

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,010
seniors have to face from daily basis so

69
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,230
older adults who live in senior care

70
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,328
facilities may simply be resigned to

71
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,929
exchanging privacy and safety and care

72
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,579
you see one of the participants said you

73
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,500
said a lot of your personal privacy

74
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,629
rights when you move into a place like

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,310
this in exchange for services being

76
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,819
rented to you I think that's the

77
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,319
different kind of service that somebody

78
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,530
that was living in a private setting and

79
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,760
would and would be using services sorry

80
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,209
it's really hard to see in a smaller

81
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,888
screen older adults living independently

82
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,989
so they're not in the senior care they

83
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,030
live in their own houses still face a

84
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,970
paradox in order to preserve the

85
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,190
autonomy and avoid moving to senior care

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,370
facility they still very often have to

87
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,870
accept care surveillance at home such as

88
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,970
surveillance cameras and various devices

89
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,790
that monitor the environment and for my

90
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,769
the caregivers or special services for

91
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,660
instance one participant said I would

92
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,910
probably choose a wolf sensor that

93
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,760
detects presence over here and over

94
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,260
having to share a room with somebody

95
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,030
being an inner Singh home so I could

96
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,220
stay in my own add up that's a

97
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,790
concession that I would make so it's to

98
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,169
a trade-off not a really clear solution

99
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,819
we also observe dad Academy in

100
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,130
participants beliefs about whether

101
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,578
they're less or more attractive targets

102
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,870
for security and privacy attacks and

103
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,030
several policy participants believed

104
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,590
older adults are especially targeted

105
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,229
because as some participants said that

106
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,570
stalkers may think older adults stupid

107
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,930
not aware fallible or trusting not my

108
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,270
words

109
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,190
that's participant work but if you

110
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,250
believe that attackers do not see older

111
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,539
adults as good targets for instance one

112
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,860
of them said

113
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:39,560
companies probably look at my data you

114
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,599
look at it oh my god don't bother with

115
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,389
her she's too old to participate or

116
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,520
maybe doesn't have enough money another

117
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,680
participant said this may be a function

118
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,590
of age because at this stage of my life

119
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,150
I don't feel like I have generate

120
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:58,219
secrets or private information one of

121
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,138
the issues participants rarely view as

122
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:01,879
threat so this is something that weird

123
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,590
researches and in fact threat but not

124
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,990
necessarily participants recognizing it

125
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,448
I related to seniors being more likely

126
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,969
to use public devices for example in

127
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,409
libraries and senior centers because

128
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,939
they're less likely to own their own

129
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:15,800
computers or smartphones than younger

130
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,710
people and that is supported by previous

131
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,139
research while using public devices is

132
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,150
an issue well first if older adults

133
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,789
don't own a computer and so they use

134
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,128
them less frequently the security risk

135
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:30,039
can be amplified by the lack of skills

136
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,960
and experience with this technologist

137
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,029
and second seniors appreciate that

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,310
someone else is maintaining public

139
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:39,590
devices as you can read on the slide I

140
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,659
don't want a home computer I go to the

141
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,549
library and if they're in if their

142
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:46,669
computers crash they will deal with it

143
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,710
if I had one and I crashed I just leaves

144
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:51,258
them and I just leave it off I don't

145
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,839
want to have to pay for the repairs but

146
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:56,270
the effectiveness of maintenance depends

147
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,569
on who is in charge and what resources

148
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,909
are available to them also in other

149
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,430
issues that the administrator security

150
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:06,229
efforts can still be compromised by user

151
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,979
behavior which goes back to the first

152
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,960
point about the lack of experience to

153
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,740
participants Oshin also mentioned using

154
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,188
public medical devices which collect

155
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,710
slightly more sensitive information at

156
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,360
times because they don't have blood

157
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,430
pressure monitors at home they go to

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,589
Walgreens and other places where they

159
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,770
have free checks such as health Fair's

160
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:31,879
is one of a participant mentioned

161
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,250
privacy and security of sensitive

162
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,469
medical data in those situation depends

163
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,839
on what exactly is collected how it is

164
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:40,669
stored and used and whether the whether

165
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:45,589
the entity is collecting the data are

166
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:47,270
subject to heap or not seven

167
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:49,399
participants all should also mentioned

168
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,680
that they use second-hand devices from

169
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,419
family friends or

170
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,600
neighbors or they often get their

171
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:58,210
furbish devices grandpa gets the oldest

172
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,090
phone when they get when they get

173
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,849
upgraded the phones trickle down this is

174
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,520
just representative fun quote from our

175
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,990
participants reusing secondhand devices

176
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,020
entails serious security and privacy

177
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,789
risks for both the previous owner such

178
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,820
as personal data disclosure or an

179
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,099
authorized access and the new owner such

180
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,680
as malware inherited from the previous

181
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,630
owner access to access to technical

182
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,150
support and security updates for older

183
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,680
devices also declines over time so the

184
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,770
older the phone the less likely that

185
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,440
it'll receive it dates in the future

186
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,090
however none of our participant

187
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,070
mentioned any potential risks from using

188
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,198
second-hand devices and only one

189
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,740
mentioned that the previous owner reset

190
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,930
the device or at least tried to as one

191
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,570
of the participants said my friend did

192
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,610
give me her old Mac she wiped her out

193
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,500
it's an older one but she was using it

194
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,560
for school and she'd video chats and

195
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,729
everything in it so it's very up-to-date

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,130
what is interesting in the square is

197
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,990
that as you can see if the device runs

198
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,990
well seniors may assume that it's up to

199
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,909
date but the security protections may be

200
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,970
outdated and that's maybe not the

201
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:09,570
factors that they consider when

202
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,800
evaluating them are inherited device

203
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,229
participants thread models were often

204
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,210
clouded by lack of transparency in user

205
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,159
interfaces for instance some

206
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,469
participants believe in incorrectly or

207
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,060
at least they're not sure about it that

208
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,509
their devices only collect information

209
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,639
that they input themselves I don't see

210
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:32,229
my phone capturing my data unless what I

211
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,270
enter similarly some tree data shown in

212
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,329
a user interface virtually as a display

213
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,799
of everything the device is collecting

214
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:40,989
there is nothing that is recorded that's

215
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:45,339
only the only thing that the phone would

216
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,260
show is who called me sometimes they

217
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,720
base assumption about data practices in

218
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,260
emerging devices or some newer modern

219
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,570
devices on analogous with older or more

220
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,610
familiar technologies for example I

221
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,320
guess what the smart speaker would do

222
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,510
would be anything that the smartphone

223
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,170
can do and then maybe more another

224
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,779
participant also mentioned that

225
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:10,490
some data can be rewritten as it used to

226
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:13,730
be on the tape for TVs moving to a

227
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,260
management strategies the security and

228
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,360
privacy management strategy that our

229
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,870
participants talked about can be

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,279
categorised along a scale from passive

231
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,860
to active approaches so it's not a

232
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,380
dichotomy it's a scale what is

233
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,420
interesting is that a while younger

234
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,000
people are often used to relying on

235
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,610
technology older adults may find it

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,820
easier to choose privacy over

237
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,620
convenience that at times leading to

238
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,139
simply limiting their use of technology

239
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,149
or avoiding it altogether so a lot of

240
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:46,040
our participants mentioned I not going

241
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,800
to start even using online banking or

242
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,180
online shopping or uber or whatever it

243
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,709
is because I'm not sure what other

244
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,800
privacy security concerns associated

245
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,839
with that for technology developers that

246
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,550
means that if privacy security concerns

247
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,430
are not addressed in their devices

248
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,760
seniors will simply decide against using

249
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,439
them a another strategy is to use

250
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,990
services and devices with good

251
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,790
reputation or simply be cautious but

252
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,010
it's subject to an overconfidence bias

253
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,560
and ability to detect risks and protect

254
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,600
against them one participant said the

255
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,369
nice thing about using Apple is that

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,230
there aren't hackers like there are with

257
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,320
windows window and windows everything

258
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,779
gets hacked my Mac has two firewalls and

259
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,870
that is all I need I think they come

260
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,920
installed so she's not sure whether the

261
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,380
comment style but version really

262
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,779
believes it is many participants

263
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,029
unfortunately mentioned simply accepting

264
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,899
or ignoring known risks which is another

265
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:44,000
kind of sad story

266
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:47,240
active mitigation strategies on another

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,920
side of that scale include configuring

268
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,620
privacy and authentication settings

269
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,349
using protective software services and

270
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,360
leading or refusing to provide personal

271
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,980
information many participants mentioned

272
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,740
strategies that mitigate the

273
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,449
consequences a violation rather than

274
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,040
that causes the root cause of the

275
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,589
problem such as blocking unwanted

276
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,360
contacts or content or discontinuing

277
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,430
their use of devices or services after

278
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,829
privacy or security violations were

279
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,560
detected however many participants

280
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:18,050
aren't certain about the usability and

281
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,400
terminus of strategists they deploy as

282
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,709
you can see one participant said well

283
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,430
that probably was a waste to invest some

284
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:29,090
money in Protective Services in some

285
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:32,000
cases even legitimacy of the provided

286
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,589
services is uncertain whereas some

287
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,170
protective software it turns out to be a

288
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,480
scam undermining their future trust in

289
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,040
security protection for example one

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,450
participant told us the story of how she

291
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,699
got a call about an illegitimate

292
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,330
illegitimate activity going on in her

293
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,180
account

294
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,820
and the person who was calling her

295
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,810
offered to purchase a service that

296
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,940
turned out to be a scam delegation of

297
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,949
security maintenance is common among the

298
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,500
general population as most of us know

299
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,300
but prior fighting suggests it may occur

300
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,910
more frequently or it was even more

301
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,130
frequently among senior users other

302
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,579
although adults in our study most

303
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,290
frequently looked for helpful from the

304
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,230
service provider the device manufacturer

305
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:18,110
or the store vendor some found those

306
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,660
measures quite effective but others were

307
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,700
frustrated by the time or difficulty

308
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,350
involved in getting help for instance

309
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,110
going to a physical store may involve

310
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,089
long trips or on transit or waits at the

311
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,360
store which may be especially difficult

312
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,130
for a person with physical declines

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,230
phone helplines can be difficult for the

314
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,780
hard-of-hearing which is also a common

315
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,260
issue among older adults and online

316
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,970
knowledge bases or automated chat BOTS

317
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,880
depend on knowing who'd how to formulate

318
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,440
the search query to get answered that

319
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,830
you're looking for and many of our

320
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,410
participants reported issue is that for

321
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,390
instance participant 13 said I tried to

322
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,610
call them when my email was hacked and

323
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,970
all of the rambures would say please go

324
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,339
online try wwo calm and get help there

325
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,470
none of the help topics are what was

326
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:09,380
what I want I finally was able to write

327
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,570
them a note they did never answer me and

328
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,990
then somehow after a couple of months it

329
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,120
gets fixed this frustration may lead to

330
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,459
older adults delaying addressing

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,089
security issues or just resigning the

332
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:24,560
sums from being unprotected many

333
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,450
participants make the first call to

334
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,949
their children relatives or neighbors or

335
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,959
others in their personal network

336
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,149
but children or other family members

337
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,768
might not have enough time to help them

338
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,709
or when they do they may try to

339
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,720
forestall further needs by discouraging

340
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:42,689
older adults from fully using the

341
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,339
technology one participants that it's

342
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,500
called touch ID yeah I think I've heard

343
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,829
of that but my son didn't sign me up for

344
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,260
that

345
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,989
so she's aware of this functionality

346
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,029
like an additional lock screen but

347
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,740
because she usually relies on her son to

348
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,810
configure it she didn't even try to

349
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,440
adopt it on her own although she's aware

350
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,689
of it several participants also

351
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,170
mentioned computer experts of the

352
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,510
frequently call for help some of these

353
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,689
volunteers are elderly themselves that

354
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,819
just leave in the same residence or go

355
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,949
to the same Senior Center and while

356
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,110
participants may trust them because as

357
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:21,990
one participant said the guy has a PhD

358
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,139
he thought he taught the technical

359
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,730
skills of such experts are often unclear

360
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,740
relying on others also reduces their

361
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,970
motivation to learn themselves how to

362
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,820
stay safe online you have someone you

363
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,620
have someone that will come and help and

364
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,500
if you have problem with your computer I

365
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,269
don't have to know that much about it so

366
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,570
if you're allowing someone maybe you

367
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,399
don't really need to spend your time a

368
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,140
small number of participants may first

369
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,420
try to set up the device or solve the

370
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,850
problem or configure some security

371
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,949
setting themselves successfully or not

372
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,350
we'll try to find the instructions

373
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:00,810
online but they're not always clear and

374
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:05,240
as you can see in a credit is just too

375
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,239
complex for older adults to understand

376
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,269
regarding the sources of information

377
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:12,060
about risks where do people learn about

378
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:15,149
privacy and security risks news media is

379
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,760
a common source however new stories can

380
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,829
often just scare older adults leaving

381
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,110
them without a clear sense of what to do

382
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:24,209
so providing some additional advice

383
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,010
would be really helpful as one

384
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:28,920
participant said I've read in the paper

385
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,870
that there are the search engines and

386
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,410
they can get into computers especially

387
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:37,110
through Wi-Fi so I have Wi-Fi turned off

388
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,390
that is not clear what is exactly the

389
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,160
threat model here and

390
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,519
the medication strategy doesn't seem to

391
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,380
be effective either another source of

392
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,440
information about risks and mitigations

393
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,330
as materials classes and lectures and

394
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,180
generally participants do find those

395
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,190
beneficial but some noted that it's hard

396
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,069
to know if the classes at the level that

397
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,640
you need or find those classes too

398
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,410
difficult for their level of experience

399
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,850
in some cases participants didn't make

400
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,339
the connection between the lecture

401
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,990
content and the consequences to their

402
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,070
personal data to their personal

403
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,329
experiences online one participant said

404
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,000
somebody came and talked about the cloud

405
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:19,890
what it is what does what does it do I

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,190
thought I don't need all this I just

407
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,920
look things up and send a few emails I

408
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,269
don't care about anything else

409
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,370
therefore targeting the materials to

410
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:32,399
seniors populations needs and technical

411
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:36,450
skills is important in such materials

412
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,459
and lectures so to wrap up future

413
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,610
large-scale studies are cool to quantify

414
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,529
some of the intriguing patterns that

415
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,959
turned out in our qualitative results

416
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:48,959
because we had only 46 participants and

417
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,750
we cannot really tell how common is this

418
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,760
issue among others and it may have

419
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,680
important implications if there is

420
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,540
significantly more common among older

421
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,520
adults compared to younger population

422
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,589
for example the use of second-hand

423
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,209
devices and public devices is one of the

424
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,880
interesting directions of future

425
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,619
research implications could also be

426
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,620
explored in controlled behavioral

427
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:13,619
studies especially to compare the views

428
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,099
of older adults with general population

429
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,739
and their security mitigation strategies

430
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,688
in this project initially we we wanted

431
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,640
to focus on older adults use of emerging

432
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,860
technologies especially health in

433
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,750
healthcare domain but we found that

434
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,020
participants use and knowledge of those

435
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,300
devices was quite heterogeneous and

436
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,550
clear themes did not emerge in in our

437
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,879
interviews so we think that the largest

438
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:41,820
scale studies needed to advance that

439
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,679
area finally in the paper we offer some

440
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,320
suggestions for education and awareness

441
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,410
measures as well as improved privacy

442
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,850
controls aimed at older adults and in

443
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,220
the future we hope that we will be able

444
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,780
to experiment with

445
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,890
maintaining and evaluating some of those

446
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,200
measures and prototypes there's much

447
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,390
more material and that I couldn't cover

448
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,940
in 15 minute presentation so encourage

449
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,860
you to go and read the paper but I will

450
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,360
stop here and leave this slide hanging

451
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:17,959
on the screen while opening the floor

452
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:20,719
for a discussion thank you so time for

453
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,280
questions we've got one

454
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,020
Cassandra's independent security

455
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,629
researcher and trainer and then also

456
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,460
author thank you this was an a

457
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,780
fantastically enlightening study as was

458
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,169
the one right before and I commend you

459
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,639
for the work that you've done and I

460
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,049
there was a point that you made that I

461
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,360
thought was really interesting where

462
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:40,820
they believe they're more targeted

463
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,699
sometimes but then also think there may

464
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,379
be less targeted by data collection I'm

465
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,780
wondering whether you saw evidence that

466
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,659
they made a distinction between like

467
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,530
general company data collecting and

468
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:56,809
targeted phishing attempts or other

469
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,760
security violations there is both there

470
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,350
is both so when the person said I don't

471
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,059
know how maybe they think I don't have

472
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,939
enough money they thought that that's

473
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,559
why someone would not probably try to

474
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,870
you know get their data and misuse it

475
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,850
because there is just like not much that

476
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,739
you can get from them so that's what was

477
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,780
probably more general data collection

478
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,520
and targeted advertising to say I'm not

479
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,740
a consumer I'm not buying drinks every

480
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,090
week like young people so that would go

481
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,130
in more into the direction of more

482
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,770
general data collection but they were

483
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:30,260
more specifically some concerns about

484
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,520
the risks and attacks and how they may

485
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,200
be assumed that you know that people

486
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,940
know that I have 401k and there are a

487
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,390
few million in my account so that's why

488
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,220
I would be a specific target of attack

489
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,929
due to my age and yeah they were more

490
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,429
specific but did you see any conflation

491
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,049
between the two or they sort of said

492
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,940
this person has collected my data online

493
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,100
ergo I will be more targeted for

494
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,929
specific things

495
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,399
it's very heterogeneous like some people

496
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:54,890
have very specific threat models some

497
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,659
people are have more general attitude oh

498
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,919
everything everyone is after me so I

499
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:00,559
have to be cautious some other people

500
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,720
think I am I'm an open book I have

501
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,520
nothing to hide and I have no like my

502
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,470
data has no value to anyone

503
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,309
I'm old I'm like my life is so blonde

504
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:13,490
I'm boring yeah so very dichotomous and

505
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,440
thanks Virginia's fees hi I'm thank you

506
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,400
very much for the presentation I thought

507
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,010
it was interesting

508
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,679
my name is pokey and I had two questions

509
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,190
the first one was did you analyze the

510
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:29,480
data also based on the devices that the

511
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:31,550
seniors used and if yes what wisk what

512
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,000
was more at risk for them like what

513
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,440
devices do they find to be what were

514
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,059
they more conscious about privacy and

515
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,340
security what devices where those

516
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:43,190
exactly yeah this very interesting

517
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,139
question so as I mentioned in a second

518
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,960
to last slide that we try to look at

519
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,030
very different devices and we and we try

520
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,130
to try to encourage the conversation not

521
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,340
only about computers and smartphones but

522
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:58,160
it was about maybe fitness trackers and

523
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,230
smart home devices few people had Alexus

524
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,540
they had some smart speakers so did you

525
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,970
talk about those but there are some

526
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:09,830
analogous that that go across the board

527
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,809
so for instance even if you use a search

528
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,699
engine it can be on mobile device it can

529
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,559
be on computer Alexa would be another

530
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,290
version of a search engine should just

531
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,660
like talks that response out so we we

532
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,428
solve a lot of similarities and most

533
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,590
people still use mostly computers and

534
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:26,630
smartphones so we didn't have that many

535
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,790
users of other technologists to make any

536
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,260
meaningful distinction or comparative

537
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,570
study between the devices so

538
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,090
unfortunately I kind of really like give

539
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,980
the generalizable comparison between

540
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,590
them that would be a good subject for

541
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,429
future research thank you so we have

542
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,850
time for one last question

543
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:51,230
thank you I wonder if you saw anything

544
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:53,178
and if so how much of people who can

545
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,950
update but avoid it because they know

546
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,590
things might change and they don't want

547
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,640
to have to figure out how to use the new

548
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,590
system yeah that's also a good question

549
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,190
basically one of the one of the common

550
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:09,709
topic that arose was about learning and

551
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,270
difficulty to learn or absence of

552
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,710
willingness to learn so people say I've

553
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,980
been learning the whole life can it

554
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,060
relax now so people sometimes are

555
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,190
reluctant to that

556
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,139
and that yeah so when it comes to new

557
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,720
technologists adapting a new interface

558
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,270
just adapting a new technology a new way

559
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,670
of doing things is a little bit of a

560
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:32,240
burden to people who don't want to do

561
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:35,060
that and therefore yeah like if there

562
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,740
are some UI changes coming together with

563
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,510
the updates that would be an specific

564
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,160
issue for although that is still

565
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,780
annoying to young people but for

566
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,140
although does it's an additional burden

567
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,860
of learning thank you okay so let's

568
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,360
thank allies again

569
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,360
[Applause]
