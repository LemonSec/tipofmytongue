1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,799
next up we have four lightning talks so

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,419
there's gonna be five minute talks we're

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,160
keeping them to five minutes and I've

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,869
been told that when five minutes is over

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,490
I'm supposed to stand up and encourage

6
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,619
you all to start clapping so that our

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,740
poor unfortunate speaker is herded off

8
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,759
the stage I'm kind of short so I'll

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,680
probably stay up and kind of wave my

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,529
arms around a little bit so please help

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,330
me get people off the stage so first up

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,860
we have Naomi Schiffman from Mozilla

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,780
who's going to talk to us about warrants

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,519
are the new black location data and the

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:50,710
Fourth Amendment

16
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:52,360
Naomi hello so I'm a former policy

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,979
researcher at Mozilla I just finished my

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,589
master's of Public Policy at UC Berkeley

19
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:59,440
and data protection enthusiasts and my

20
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:02,379
research was on location data in the

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,009
fallout of the carpenter' versus the US

22
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,750
Supreme Court decision of June 2018 so

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,299
just a short recap for those of you who

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,409
may not be aware Carpenter was a Supreme

25
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:17,890
Court decision that essentially stated

26
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:21,430
that warrants are necessary to seize

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,430
sell site location information in

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,109
Criminal Procedure so CSL I sell site

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,840
location information is data that your

30
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:30,699
cell phone sends to Towers automatically

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,320
I just when it's checking in to make

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,670
sure that the tower is still there right

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,439
or that the signals still working and

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,880
and before this case that was considered

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,029
not not protected under the Fourth

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,158
Amendment and after carpenter that kind

37
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,499
of data is and so the question is what

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,479
other kind of location data can be

39
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:53,408
considered protected under the Fourth

40
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:56,770
Amendment so what kind of location data

41
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:59,079
did we talk about in this study so we're

42
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,449
looking at web browser location data so

43
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:05,499
that's not just IP addresses but it's

44
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,149
specifically precise location data so

45
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:08,799
your browser will ask you if you want to

46
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,640
share your location data with a certain

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,900
website if you say yes that website is

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,940
identifying your precise location data

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,720
through a combination of means

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,430
triangulating between Wi-Fi routers GPS

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,629
and they can keep this location data

52
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,310
indefinitely and

53
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,260
we don't have a data protection law in

54
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,819
this country and sometimes this is

55
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,578
collected for service provision

56
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,129
sometimes it's not but if you you know

57
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:36,889
select remember this setting after

58
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,599
you've granted access that website can

59
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:41,269
collect your location data every time

60
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,200
you log on to that site without asking

61
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:47,599
again so on the set up for this study is

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,298
that we we ran a survey and we showed

63
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:55,668
users this this pop up so on Firefox

64
00:02:52,299 --> 00:03:00,409
this is what the location the location

65
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:02,959
request looks like and we ran a survey

66
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:06,909
through heartbeat which is Firefox's

67
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,620
survey tool for two weeks and we had a

68
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:11,328
sample size of a little over sixty six

69
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,459
hundred we only sampled within the

70
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:15,769
United States and users just got like a

71
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,120
small drop-down bar at the top of their

72
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,000
browser asking if they wanted to

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,819
participate in the survey and we also

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,769
gathered telemetry data about the the

75
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,488
location prompts so we targeted this

76
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:32,030
survey at folks ten percent of all all

77
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:34,099
users who had recently seen a location

78
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,169
data prompt and agreed to have their

79
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:38,810
data shared ten percent who had not

80
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:41,180
agreed and then point five percent who

81
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,120
had not even received the prompt just to

82
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,099
round out our sample and we asked them

83
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,650
eight questions focused on criminal

84
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,659
procedure and consumer privacy and here

85
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,189
is what we found

86
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,840
so ninety-three percent of all users

87
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,939
believe that police should need

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,889
permission from a court to obtain

89
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:01,698
location data of this specific kind

90
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:03,829
sixty three percent believe that

91
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,469
websites should notify users when

92
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,599
they've shared location data with law

93
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:10,340
enforcement and seventy two percent

94
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,250
believe that websites should delete

95
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,439
location data immediately so that that

96
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,149
actually was right when the users

97
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,380
navigated away from the page not just

98
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,899
when they close the browser window or

99
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,330
quit the browser application we also

100
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,190
asked questions that compared location

101
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,280
data to other types of data that are

102
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,960
more more stringently protected in the

103
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,059
United States so we asked about

104
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,919
willingness to share location versus

105
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,169
financial data and we gave examples

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,389
financial data was like being

107
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,830
transaction records not just your credit

108
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,770
card number which everyone throws around

109
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,210
the internet so we saw about an equal

110
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,400
split there was people were about

111
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,318
equally divided between seeing location

112
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,620
data as more or less or equally

113
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,810
sensitive and we had a similar split

114
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,810
with location and medical data and the

115
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,639
medical data example was like your

116
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,449
heartbeat in your fitness tracker for

117
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,759
example so what does it all mean

118
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,409
location data is sensitive people see it

119
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,169
as about they're about split on whether

120
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:11,779
they see it equally sensitive to

121
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:14,359
financial end and medical data and they

122
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:16,490
want it they want it gone immediately

123
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,770
right users think that that website

124
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,770
should delete this immediately once they

125
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,818
leave the page and then also users think

126
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,139
law enforcement should require

127
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,879
permission from a judge to access

128
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,740
location data so they see it as

129
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,499
sensitive and think that it should be

130
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,659
protected so questions for future is

131
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:34,310
searched and we're curious about how

132
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,349
student companies should notify users of

133
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,969
law enforcement requests how much data

134
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,219
companies should be able to share with

135
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:42,649
law enforcement when law enforcement has

136
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:44,360
requested it and we're also wondering

137
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,729
whether users feel if location data

138
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,399
privacy depends on whom they're sharing

139
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,940
that location data with thank you very

140
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:59,440
much

141
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:59,440
[Applause]

142
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:41,229
okay so next up we have Jim Fenton from

143
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:42,550
alt mode networks to talk through a

144
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:47,949
privacy and security focused

145
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:50,769
notification system thanks I'm Jim FEMEN

146
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,509
actually an independent consultant and

147
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,189
what I want to talk about is a side

148
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,129
project that I've had going on for a

149
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:59,949
while on dealing with notifications

150
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:02,349
which I think our existing mechanisms

151
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,749
which are primarily email and SMS and

152
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:06,579
things like that do not handle in an

153
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,740
appropriate way especially with respect

154
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,800
to privacy and in to some extent

155
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,809
security as well to start with I need to

156
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,059
set some context by what I mean by

157
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:18,189
notification so I've got a bunch of

158
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,419
examples up here I hope hope some of you

159
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,729
can see them

160
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,579
they range everywhere from there's a

161
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:28,539
tornado warning there somewhere I think

162
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:31,179
all the way down to free gift card at LL

163
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:33,699
Bean or you know the sort of the free

164
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:36,758
latte at your coffee shop is the is the

165
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,949
common example that I give the idea is

166
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,229
there's a whole range of things that we

167
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,269
get notifications about and they have

168
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,459
radically different urgencies some of

169
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:48,279
these you one deal you you really want

170
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:50,229
to know about right away and some of

171
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,209
these are like okay well that's nice

172
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:59,199
next time I'm past going past the coffee

173
00:07:52,209 --> 00:08:01,179
shop I'll deal with that so the the

174
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,479
problems that we have with this right

175
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:06,909
now actually we we tend to focus on the

176
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,599
ones that we have as people getting

177
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:11,539
notifications but the notify

178
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,030
have a lot of problems as well for us

179
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,350
the big privacy problem is that if we

180
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,229
want to get a notification about

181
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,390
something we have to give out our phone

182
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,940
number our cell phone number typically

183
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,280
or email address or something like that

184
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,810
and that tends to inhibit people from

185
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,059
signing up for things that they might

186
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,460
otherwise be interested in if they don't

187
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,470
know something about the notifier we

188
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,449
also get a lot of clutter we get

189
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,120
messages about things that have already

190
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,430
happened or sales that have already

191
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,729
finished or tornado warnings that have

192
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:47,680
already expired and it would be nice if

193
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:49,970
the system would clean those up for us

194
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,000
there's a certain amount of spam that we

195
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,070
get we're not always sure that the

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,190
notification is really from who we think

197
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,380
it is but on the notifier side

198
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,850
I mean suppose you're a marketing person

199
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,110
you would like to know that the people

200
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:09,410
that you're sending these notifications

201
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:11,930
to actually got them if you know I I get

202
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,670
maybe three notices from my dentist's

203
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,469
office every time I have an appointment

204
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,410
they want to make sure that I know to

205
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,770
come so they send me an SMS and a text

206
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,800
message and an email all because you

207
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,600
know that that's optimizes for them the

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,380
possibility that that I will actually

209
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:34,880
get one of those I'd rather not get all

210
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,040
three notifications also change I mean

211
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,630
you'll using the tornado example you

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,670
could have a tornado watch that becomes

213
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,620
a tornado warning well you don't need

214
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,640
the tornado watch notification you need

215
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,890
the the warning now or the or the the

216
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,449
the threat goes away and you can you

217
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,610
want to be able to delete these things

218
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,940
all of the messaging things that we have

219
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,670
right now tend to be send a message and

220
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,110
if you need to update it you need to

221
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,640
send another message more clutter

222
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,190
there's also no way to indicate the

223
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,930
urgency in in in most of our message

224
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,520
messaging systems it would be nice to

225
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,989
know that the tornado warning is

226
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,740
something that I really needed to be

227
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,800
warned about so

228
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,660
I have been thinking about an approach

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,329
to this and doing some work on approach

230
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,339
to this where there's basically a user

231
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,410
chosen agent you can think of it as

232
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,720
being sort of like an email server but

233
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,670
it's not an email server that sits in

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,160
the middle and it represents you as the

235
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,150
as the user not the notifier so

236
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,839
notifiers

237
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:45,890
can send notifications to this agent

238
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:49,400
using a REST API so it's a single hop

239
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:52,840
sort of thing the the notifier gets

240
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:58,449
immediate feedback if the if the

241
00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:01,580
notification isn't accepted they also

242
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,430
use a unique address that represents not

243
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,590
the not the recipient but the the

244
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,839
relationship that the recipient has with

245
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,260
the notifier and then the notification

246
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,360
agent has rules in it that allow you to

247
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,090
allow the user to specify how they'd

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,790
like to get how they like the agent to

249
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,160
respond to they want to get an SMS do

250
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,110
they want to get some sort of a push

251
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,569
notification or can they just read it

252
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,330
when they get around to it so this has

253
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,130
been a side project for a few years now

254
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,110
I've got some prototypes that are

255
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,510
actually up on github if anybody is

256
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,820
interested in playing with them I keep

257
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,280
tweaking this I've been working on an

258
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,050
IMAP interface because you might want to

259
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,439
scan the notifications using your

260
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,959
friendly email agent and I've been

261
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,550
working on some interfaces to other

262
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,250
things that might generate notifications

263
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,930
like Twitter although Twitter keeps

264
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,960
changing its api's on me

265
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,239
so there's some more information at it

266
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,950
at a URL it's there and if anybody is

267
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,080
interested in this stuff I would be

268
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,300
happy to hear from you so thank you very

269
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,910
much

270
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:14,008
[Applause]

271
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,930
okay so next step we have Jim Lane from

272
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,670
virtue who's going to talk about growing

273
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,508
a UX team and a privacy and security

274
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,509
organization

275
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,490
all right let's see

276
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:54,670
that's right and now for something

277
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:58,360
completely different about a year ago I

278
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,099
was presented an unusual opportunity to

279
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,180
join a data protection and privacy

280
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,840
organization in DC and bootstrap UX from

281
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,449
the ground up

282
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,670
no team no process and this was an

283
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,110
interesting opportunity and I wanted to

284
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,180
share some of the strategies of employed

285
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,250
I've led teams for about 20 years and

286
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,550
share some of the strategies for growing

287
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,620
UX and research in your organization's

288
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:24,250
so as everybody here knows usability is

289
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,230
a big problem for instance only 43% of

290
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,420
organizations employee encryption across

291
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,910
the enterprise one of the reasons why is

292
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,229
they're just too hard to use and without

293
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,209
usability you don't have adoption

294
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,000
without adoption the best security

295
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,770
solutions fail so I had my work cut out

296
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,980
for me I needed to put some basic

297
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,620
building blocks in place really quickly

298
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,420
and particularly in a start-up setting

299
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,610
one of the first questions was what's

300
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,199
the strategic importance of UX and

301
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,990
research in the organization and new

302
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,480
teams oftentimes struggle with this is

303
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,730
their executive buy-in and how do I get

304
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,100
it one of things I recommend for a new

305
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,480
teams and new leaders is talk to

306
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,680
leadership about what the strategic

307
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,330
business priorities are in the

308
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,040
organization and then how will you

309
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,080
measure UX how will you measure research

310
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,370
and then tie those metrics back to the

311
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,870
business goals of the company it's a

312
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,850
great way to start the conversation and

313
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,980
then map the team's goals to those

314
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,070
objectives speaking of which I needed a

315
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,080
team because there wasn't one so UX is a

316
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,140
really broad field there's a lot of

317
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,760
disciplines some people are specialists

318
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,920
like information architects use

319
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,900
researchers some people are generalists

320
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,849
to do a lot of different things virtru

321
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,189
had four kinds of products generally

322
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,430
speaking and so what I do is hired for

323
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,980
relatively senior product designers who

324
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:42,400
could then align with each of those

325
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,690
groups of products your mileage may vary

326
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,069
but when you're looking to hire

327
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,050
designers and researchers particularly

328
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,450
designers

329
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,250
look beyond portfolio think about

330
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,810
process how do they work

331
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,930
and look for soft skills like

332
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,878
communication collaboration agility

333
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,529
these are things that are much harder to

334
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,290
teach than a particular design tool

335
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:05,079
particular research tool and then

336
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,060
process so how to weave design and

337
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,229
research into an agile product

338
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,989
development process now there's whole

339
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,480
meetups and events about this but what

340
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,879
we did was each of those designers is

341
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,920
aligned with a product manager and an

342
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,680
engineering manager to make sure that

343
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,240
prototyping and research is tied in

344
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,310
every step of the product development

345
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
lifecycle and that we're measuring every

346
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,638
step of the way so we had the data

347
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,939
science to back up the design research

348
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,860
conclusions we cut private and one of

349
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:35,980
the recommendations I make to a new team

350
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,689
is figure out how to demonstrate value

351
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,220
quickly so for instance when the team

352
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,079
first started the first thing we did was

353
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,850
you're a sneak evaluations of every one

354
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,279
of the products that way we could

355
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,389
determine ok based on best practices one

356
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,220
of the most important things that we

357
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,930
need to address first while we get our

358
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,100
legs under us so it's a quick way to get

359
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:57,430
started and then think about tools

360
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,290
virtru has multiple kinds of products

361
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,779
web applications browser extensions

362
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,399
mobile applications and so we knew we

363
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,870
needed to scale it a sign really quickly

364
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,850
so we invested pretty heavily in the

365
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,040
first year in a design system we call

366
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,639
virtuoso built on sketch and abstract

367
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,170
and and storybook we also needed to take

368
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,639
into account compliance and localization

369
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,170
accessibility mobile form factors the

370
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,790
design system helped us do that a lot

371
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,439
more quickly and with confidence but

372
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,959
whatever tools your team puts together

373
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:27,849
think about scale and speed and

374
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,899
particularly how our designers and

375
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,540
developers and research is going to

376
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:35,410
collaborate and handoff resources assets

377
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:38,230
and styles and such and finally strategy

378
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,759
how are we going to design virtru

379
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,009
defines usable encryption very

380
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,889
specifically as protection that is

381
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:47,079
persistent that it requires no previous

382
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,059
relationship no exchanging of keys there

383
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,069
is control and visibility into how data

384
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:53,350
is protected so how to create usable

385
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:55,628
experiences that really promote and

386
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,980
support this I like to use a model with

387
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,720
a new team of just a really basic

388
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,699
modified Maslow pyramid of needs

389
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,769
starting first with how will we

390
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,530
demonstrate and Pyrrhic ly with testing

391
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,359
that are

392
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,730
customers can actually use the product

393
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,760
that's baseline have to start with that

394
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,860
then thinking about triggers which we

395
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,810
heard about yesterday of how do we

396
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,250
notify when do we notify when do we warn

397
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,440
when do we block what does that look

398
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,940
like one of the right times to step in

399
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,040
and then as the customers grow in

400
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,370
complexity how do we scale the exploring

401
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,050
experience with their sophistication and

402
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:29,179
then ultimately arrive at product

403
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,830
experiences that are unlocking

404
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,920
collaboration unlocking the power of

405
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,679
data and then that are easy to use but

406
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:48,020
also powerful so I thank you very much

407
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:49,430
for your attention and thank you so for

408
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,710
our last talk of the session and we've

409
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,730
got Asia from Rutgers University is

410
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,410
going to talk to us about social

411
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,890
interventions to reduce the privacy

412
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,890
paradox

413
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:50,820
okay is this better okay great so my

414
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,240
name is Ashish Akash I am a doctoral

415
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,689
candidate from Rutgers New Jersey and

416
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,030
I'm here to talk about my proposal which

417
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,970
is the use of social interventions to

418
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,250
reduce the privacy paradox so basically

419
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,679
what I'm doing is exploring the

420
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,370
contradictory relationship that exists

421
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,440
between privacy attitudes and behaviors

422
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,168
as other people in this talk have said

423
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,260
or in these sessions have talked about a

424
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:21,120
large number of people say that they are

425
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,100
highly concerned about privacy they are

426
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,379
worried about how their data is being

427
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,340
used by third parties by government

428
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,400
agencies by websites but we don't see a

429
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,199
similar behavior demonstrated by these

430
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,990
people when it comes to protecting their

431
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,090
data or not sharing their data some of

432
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,390
these have been discussed in previous

433
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:45,090
talks about the use of password managers

434
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,070
or two factor authentication Zoar other

435
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,220
forms of protecting the data it could

436
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,799
simply be a lack of awareness there's a

437
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,220
large amount of research on why people

438
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,110
don't make these don't take these steps

439
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,150
but this gap or this inconsistency

440
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,040
between attitudes and behaviors has

441
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,220
basically been called the privacy

442
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,200
paradox in research literature as I

443
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,240
mentioned there has been a large amount

444
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,929
of research that talks about this gap

445
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,960
and why it exists but there hasn't been

446
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:17,690
similar research in how we can use

447
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,520
intervention specifically social

448
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,559
interventions in reducing this gap

449
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,179
between attitudes and behaviors there

450
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,160
have been there has been work on

451
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:29,400
shifting attitudes or shifting behaviors

452
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,890
but there hasn't been enough work on how

453
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,260
we can reduce this misalignment between

454
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:37,260
attitudes and behaviors which is where

455
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,870
my proposal comes in where I intend to

456
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,590
use social influence

457
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:45,889
interventions to solve this misalignment

458
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,810
or correct this misalignment previous

459
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,960
work has used in security and privacy

460
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:53,810
has used social interventions work by us

461
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,000
at all has used social proof to

462
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,310
encourage the adoption of privacy or

463
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,070
security settings we've seen similar

464
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,810
work in the case of privacy policies and

465
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,340
reducing uncertainty about privacy

466
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:09,110
policies what I propose is a fifteen-day

467
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,639
between subject interventional study

468
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:16,550
where we first measure privacy attitudes

469
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,950
of through an online survey we use a

470
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:22,190
scale to measure user privacy attitudes

471
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,890
we then invite participants into a lab

472
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,980
and ask them to perform a set of

473
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,140
disclosure tasks typically tied into the

474
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,030
to the scale so in the scale if we ask

475
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,520
them how comfortable they are sharing

476
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,770
their location data or medical data we

477
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,430
would ask them to perform a tasks that

478
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,800
gets them to share exactly the data that

479
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,390
we asked them for in the scale we then

480
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,490
give them three different types of

481
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,860
interventions we divide participants

482
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,510
into three groups each of these

483
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,850
interventions is based on a separate

484
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,220
concept so we have social proof based

485
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,310
interventions which is the use of social

486
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,050
influence we then have an information

487
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,429
inconsistency intervention which is

488
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,550
simply telling people that your

489
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,260
attitudes and behaviors don't match and

490
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,840
then we have a control group or a

491
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,030
baseline intervention so the big

492
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,449
research question here is to study if

493
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,620
social proof is a more effective way to

494
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,740
reduce the misalignment between

495
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,750
attitudes and behaviors we then have an

496
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,450
after intervention session where we

497
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,690
again invite we again do the we measure

498
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,550
privacy attitudes online in lab session

499
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,430
two we invite participants back to the

500
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,860
lab and we ask them to perform similar

501
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,200
activities that they did in the first

502
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,379
step so we don't ask them to disclose

503
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,840
the same data or perform the same tasks

504
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:46,090
we ask them to perform similar tasks for

505
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,740
instance in study one if we ask them to

506
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,629
share pictures from their Facebook

507
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,040
account in the after session we would

508
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,460
ask them to share a video from their

509
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,399
snack

510
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,640
account so tasks that are similar but

511
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,680
not exactly the same this is a sample of

512
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,350
the three interventions that we plan to

513
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,350
use as you see all three of them have

514
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,639
basically the same message but the

515
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,370
difference is that in the first

516
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,200
intervention we focus on the fact that

517
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,840
they are doing something that a majority

518
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,560
of the population is not doing here the

519
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,959
idea is that people consider something

520
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,419
that the majority is doing as a good or

521
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,760
a right behavior so if we tell them that

522
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,040
your behavior is unlike what the

523
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,800
majority of the population is doing we

524
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,840
might see some changes in the second

525
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,909
group we simply tell people that their

526
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,980
attitudes and behaviors do not match and

527
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,340
in the third we just give them basic

528
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:44,090
information about their behavior without

529
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,790
giving them any further prompts now very

530
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,770
quickly because I'm out of time the

531
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,540
reason that this study is important or

532
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,790
that we are thinking about this study is

533
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,270
because this gap between attitudes and

534
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,320
behaviors has existed for a long time

535
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,020
reducing this gap or helping people

536
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,820
better understand why their attitudes

537
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,070
and behaviors don't match and how they

538
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,960
can match it would help them feel more

539
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,740
in control of their data and feel better

540
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,300
about sharing information so that thank

541
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:16,000
you

542
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,000
[Applause]
