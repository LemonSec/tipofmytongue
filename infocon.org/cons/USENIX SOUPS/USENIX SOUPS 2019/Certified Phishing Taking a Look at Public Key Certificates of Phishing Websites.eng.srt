1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,120
thank you so today I'll present the work

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,460
I did together with Malika Maya

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,730
fishing certificates and I want to start

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,520
by ya answering the question why would

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,960
we even look at certificates and the

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,720
reason is that we've seen a steady

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,890
increase of websites that are using

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,589
HTTPS up to 90 percent of page loads are

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:41,570
using HTTPS in some regions of the world

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,370
and phishing websites going along with

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,530
this trend we've seen a rapid

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,500
development of phishing websites that

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,050
are using HTTPS in the last years and up

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,290
to a 60 percent according to this record

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,750
mm-hmm and looking at this data we were

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:00,769
wondering what kind of certificates are

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,000
phishing websites using and can we use

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,399
the information included in the

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,480
certificates to learn something about

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,060
the attacker or maybe detect better

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,040
detect phishing websites maybe in an

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,000
automated setting or a user education

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,700
setting and yeah these are the questions

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,100
that I'll be talking about in this in

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,020
this talk but first make sure that we

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,929
are on the same page recording some

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,600
terms I think all of you are familiar

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,810
with what phishing is I've just included

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,669
this slide so that the yet the terms

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:44,270
I'll be using are clear when I'm talking

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,760
about phishing there are three actors

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,860
involved the victim the attacker and the

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,430
target and the target has some website

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,670
that is copied by the attacker who then

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,650
sends a link to the fake website to the

36
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,440
user who probably clicks on it and

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,930
enters their credentials and yeah in

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,910
this talk we are going to look at the

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,940
website of the attacker and specifically

40
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,180
there are certificates so what kind of

41
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,269
information can we find in a certificate

42
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,879
there are several types of certificates

43
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:19,879
they can be roughly divided into into

44
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,450
three types the first is called the main

45
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,799
bullet validated certificate and this

46
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,310
type of certificate only includes

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,810
information on the domain name

48
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,900
of the subject so this is the most basic

49
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,890
type and it can be verified

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:41,140
automatically as this for example done

51
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:45,160
by the issuer let's encrypt however CES

52
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,950
also have the ability to verify more

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,640
about the subject than just ownership of

54
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,100
the domain and this could result in an

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,920
organization validated certificate you

56
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,620
can see that in this case not only is

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,690
information about the domain including

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,630
the certificate but also an organization

59
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,030
name in the attribute organizational

60
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,239
attribute of the certificate

61
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,200
however the URL bar even though yeah

62
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,000
there are differences in the

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,200
certificates usually does not make

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,239
differences between these two types

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,459
there is however a third type that is

66
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,900
called extended validation and yeah to

67
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,010
grant an extended validation certificate

68
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,989
ACA has to follow a very strict process

69
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,120
which is at least currently and in some

70
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,150
browsers displayed differently in the

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,829
euro and as you can imagine the more

72
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,030
information we can find in a certificate

73
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:45,400
the more we can yeah argue about this

74
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,459
certificates so in following we are

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,530
going to see what we found we were

76
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,440
mainly concerned with two research

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,530
questions the first is are there general

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,600
difference between certificates of

79
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,310
fishing and Pinay on websites so for

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,310
these we looked at the tool and data

81
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,420
sets and we're finding out for example

82
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,220
all fishing websites using let's

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:11,250
equipped while none of the benign what's

84
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:13,870
do mmm for the second question we

85
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:18,608
include some additional context and

86
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,250
we're trying to find out if the fishing

87
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,750
websites are able to replicate

88
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,200
information of the certificate of the

89
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,500
targets and here at the core of both of

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,760
these questions is a comparison between

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,000
fishing and benign certificates so I

92
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,130
will now explain how we how we collected

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,960
those certificates

94
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:43,450
yeah we started by creating two data

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,260
sets benign and phishing and both data

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,180
sets originate from

97
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,120
yeah the certificates were extracted

98
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,860
from here else and pb9 URLs were

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,610
collected from Alexa these are the top

100
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:03,250
50,000 lists on the Alexa app list and

101
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:08,560
the fishing data set was created by a

102
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:10,810
curing fish tank and we collected more

103
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,580
than 30,000 fishing URLs from this

104
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:19,510
website over a period of 53 days yeah

105
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,760
after extracting the URLs we were yeah

106
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,969
we collected the certificates and this

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,610
was done in the same way for both both

108
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:32,890
datasets and we collected more than

109
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,440
43,000 benign and more than 25,000

110
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,210
fishing certificates from these women

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,450
removed several and duplicate

112
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,969
certificates and we were also decided to

113
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,370
focus only on valid certificates I'm

114
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,410
sorry we moved invalid certificates as

115
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,810
well and ended up with a data set that

116
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,340
contained almost 40,000 benign and

117
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,430
almost 10,000 phishing valid

118
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,260
certificates so we can already say that

119
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:04,180
just looking at a warning and deciding

120
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:07,120
that a phishing website must be the one

121
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,110
that has a warning with the HTTP invalid

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,110
it's no longer the case hmm so starting

123
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,320
from these collected certificates we

124
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,930
then extracted features that we wanted

125
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,800
to look at a little more closely and

126
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,660
yeah and did the analysis and I will now

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,260
present the results I'll start with the

128
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,610
with some general differences mmm so

129
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,909
there was the first research question

130
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,270
and the first thing I want to show you

131
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:41,050
is the distribution of radiation types

132
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,299
so this represents in a way the

133
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,520
information that is included in the

134
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,250
information in the certificates of the

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,250
different data sets and we can see here

136
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,590
on the Saiga

137
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,810
the percentages of organization

138
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,789
validated extent validated and domain

139
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:04,360
validated certificates and we can see

140
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:08,020
that the percentages in the benign

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,889
dataset for ovn TV are much higher then

142
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,810
in the fishing data set however there

143
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,849
are some organization validated and even

144
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,759
some extended validated certificates in

145
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,650
the fishing data set just as a small

146
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,650
aside on the extent of vacation part

147
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,719
because that might surprise some we were

148
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,620
sampling some of these certificates and

149
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:31,990
we did not find any conventional fishing

150
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,449
website on these websites instead there

151
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,750
were some false positives in the fish

152
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:40,409
tank data set we also found some

153
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:44,110
apparent miss classifications and lastly

154
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:46,629
websites that returned error pages for

155
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,509
the URLs so it might be that fishing was

156
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:53,650
hosted on these services but the website

157
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:56,949
was cleaned but yeah the main thing we

158
00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:00,669
can see from this figure is that a large

159
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:02,740
majority of websites in the benign and

160
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:06,099
the phishing case are using domain

161
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,750
validated certificates and so we were

162
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,870
trying to find out if we can find any

163
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,900
other differences in the certificates

164
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,199
that might be helpful to differentiate

165
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,799
the two so for this we looked at the at

166
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:25,139
the issue us since certificates from the

167
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,270
same issue at tend to be very similar so

168
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,719
two certificates issued by let's encrypt

169
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:34,779
typically have the same policies and

170
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:38,140
even very similar algorithms in key

171
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:41,439
sizes and again we found some

172
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,380
substantial overlap between the two yeah

173
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,720
as you might have noticed this is the

174
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,970
distribution of the five more five must

175
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,360
come fishing issuers and indeed let's

176
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,640
encrypt is the most popular issue of

177
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,600
phishing websites however it is also

178
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,399
very popular in the benign data set yeah

179
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,070
and from this we do the conclusion that

180
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,450
in a general case it might not be

181
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,840
possible

182
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:11,110
to decide if a certificate is belongs to

183
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,060
a phishing website or benign website you

184
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:18,640
can see this if you have let's encrypt

185
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:20,020
certificate and yeah the tool let's

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,760
encrypt certificates one is benign one

187
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,630
is phishing the only way they might

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,819
differentiate is the the domain name and

189
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:32,500
this can be almost freely chosen by the

190
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:35,080
attacker so that was the first research

191
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,160
question let me go on to the second

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:43,690
research question and here again we were

193
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:47,020
trying to compare the target certificate

194
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,430
to the certificates of phishing websites

195
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:53,560
that attacked this particular target and

196
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,770
we created a table for this and I'm

197
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,400
going to explain it and the example of

198
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,490
paper which was the most popular target

199
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,050
of phishing attacks in our data set so

200
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,650
that's why it's ranked 1 the target name

201
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:12,400
is paper we had more than 10 more than

202
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,110
1000 Malay certificates of phishing

203
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,939
websites that target paper so it's quite

204
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:21,690
a lot hmm and the main thing we found is

205
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:26,980
that the organization part of the

206
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:28,990
certificate is not at all recreated so

207
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,960
paper actually uses an extended

208
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,490
validation certificate so the

209
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,290
certificate does include information on

210
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,940
the organization however none of the

211
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,300
phishing websites was able to or maybe

212
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:47,670
even tried to recreate this information

213
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:51,099
just as a comparison there were 84

214
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:56,290
phishing websites that had papers or the

215
00:10:51,100 --> 00:11:00,150
name people as they're in their URL or

216
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:05,370
the domain name part of the uvula and

217
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:08,740
this was the not the exception but

218
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,220
rather the majority of the targets we

219
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,740
looked at followed a similar pattern so

220
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,830
the organization's did not match and

221
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,110
there were varying amounts of

222
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,279
you are matches there were however some

223
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:27,120
exceptions to this namely these three

224
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,580
targets had phishing websites that were

225
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,589
able to recreate organization

226
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:37,410
information the interesting part of this

227
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:40,110
is that all of these websites phishing

228
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,449
websites that created the organization

229
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,480
were hosted on the target sound

230
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,300
infrastructure so these services or

231
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,050
targets offer services where users or

232
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,719
customers can upload their own content

233
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:58,469
and the content is then protected with

234
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,450
the certificate of the target and in

235
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,140
such a case the organization and

236
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:12,240
actually your l-pod would also be appear

237
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:16,050
to be valid and the less since we only

238
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,290
saw the same issuer in only phishing

239
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,300
websites that were hosted on benign

240
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,270
infrastructure so to speak we can see

241
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,050
that are we rather did not see any

242
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,839
evidence of attack has actively

243
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,949
replicating the information that can be

244
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,040
found in certificates

245
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:39,060
however yeah and the abuse of target

246
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,610
infrastructure is possible so that's

247
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,529
what we found for for the two research

248
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:49,440
questions now if you wanted to actually

249
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:51,660
use certificates for fishing in tection

250
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,350
in practice there's two some open

251
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,660
questions that I will be talking about

252
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,339
now the first obviously is the

253
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,110
discriminative power we've seen that

254
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,730
there are lots of benign websites that

255
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,220
do not have an external validation or

256
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,470
organization validation certificate and

257
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,839
in such a case we really don't have much

258
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,430
information to go by and I'm not saying

259
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,250
that everyone should know switch to

260
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,810
another certificate that would not

261
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:20,130
really be practical since they usually

262
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:24,899
cost much more and yeah might be harder

263
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:27,060
to automate but it is a factor we would

264
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,980
have to consider if we are were trying

265
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,050
to implement

266
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,880
phishing detections based on

267
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:38,680
certificates as for the second question

268
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,970
we've seen that none of the information

269
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,400
was recreated at the current time we

270
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,470
might ask the question what about the

271
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,020
future is it possible that attack us

272
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,700
would start replicating certificate

273
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,840
information and yeah this is basically

274
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,070
comes down to the question do we have to

275
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,690
trust the CAS not to include stuff in

276
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:08,650
the certificate that is not correct or

277
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:12,010
that might be misleading they saw over a

278
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,100
project that tries to answer this which

279
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:18,220
is the certificate transparency project

280
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,140
that's basically a public and verifiable

281
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,290
lock that includes all valid

282
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:27,390
certificates and it's mainly currently

283
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:30,880
mainly used to detect issuance of

284
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,010
certificates for domain names that they

285
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,800
should not have been issued for however

286
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:39,510
it could in theory be extended to also

287
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,510
include other certificate information

288
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:54,160
yeah lastly if we were to look at

289
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,360
actually implementing phishing

290
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,430
attraction based on certificates we

291
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,510
would also have to deal with some other

292
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:05,349
problems for example TLS interception if

293
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:08,290
the certificate exchange is intercepted

294
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,650
by a third party as is for example the

295
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,900
case with some antivirus products or has

296
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:18,160
even been shortly the case on a national

297
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,600
scale yeah we might not get the

298
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,380
information out of the certificate that

299
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,110
we are interested in in with with these

300
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,500
problems and open questions I'd like to

301
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,120
conclude the talk we've seen that it is

302
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,000
very hard to differ

303
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,460
to differentiate in general between

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,370
benign and fishing's certificates might

305
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,770
even be impossible however we did not

306
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,209
find any evidence that attackers are

307
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:47,490
actively replicating

308
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:52,268
contents of their targets certificate

309
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:55,740
and yeah as often questions that I very

310
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:59,050
gladly extend to the audience

311
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,240
maybe certificates can be used in the

312
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:06,670
future for automated detection or user

313
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:08,559
detection I'm interested yeah and what

314
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:17,800
you think on that and with that thank

315
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:24,610
you for attention do we have any

316
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:27,579
questions hi I am Jim Fenton did you

317
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,139
make any you mentioned the the sites

318
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:32,498
that were hosted on the target zone

319
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:35,730
infrastructure yes did you do anything

320
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:38,529
to distinguish the cases where the

321
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,290
Fisher had actually obtained a

322
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:44,050
certificate as a you know perhaps with a

323
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,769
deceptive domain name in order to make

324
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:51,819
it look likely or verses other cases

325
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:55,059
where the attacker might have just

326
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:57,368
simply found a site that they could

327
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:05,829
break into and and and host the phishing

328
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:09,760
page off of yeah we we labeled the data

329
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:14,408
as by that top targets by using the the

330
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,419
fishtank entries and if I say that the

331
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:18,819
target was not replicated I mean that it

332
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:21,610
was not replicated by any of the

333
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:26,470
phishing websites that had the target

334
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,918
label in the data set does that answer

335
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,049
the question

336
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:33,880
yeah I'm not sure I quite understood but

337
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:35,590
I question was I'm wondering in how many

338
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,360
how many of those cases you think that

339
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,120
the attacker actually had to go out and

340
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,830
obtain a certificate oh yeah use one

341
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,928
that was on an on a site or yeah in that

342
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,320
case I would say the zero that is pretty

343
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:49,370
much the point yes

344
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,370
[Laughter]

345
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,750
hello Jeffrey Goldberg from 1password

346
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,460
I've seen a fair amount of research

347
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:06,940
which I wasn't able to find right now on

348
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,640
the non effectiveness of EB certificates

349
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,250
yeah and users have just wondering okay

350
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,750
you're obviously familiar with it if you

351
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:18,040
comment on how that might connect to

352
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,130
your research and possible

353
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:25,350
recommendations yeah I think this is a

354
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:28,770
very recent and ongoing discussion and

355
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:35,379
really kind of had to comment on

356
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:38,290
personally we we did not find any

357
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,810
concrete evidence that external

358
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,770
radiation certificates were abused there

359
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,770
was some evidence that might point to

360
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:54,070
compromise of extended validation

361
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:56,820
websites yeah I am honestly not sure

362
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,820
what else to say

363
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:12,789
do you you mentioned that or you showed

364
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:15,789
in your graph there are some issues that

365
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:17,619
are very more common on phishing

366
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,399
websites like yeah it was something like

367
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:22,019
that

368
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:26,768
is that an issue known to these

369
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:28,330
companies or did you contact them I'm

370
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:33,219
not sure if they are aware of this fact

371
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:35,259
I think this evens out if we move away a

372
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:40,599
little from the top fifty thousand of

373
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:45,190
the Alexa list and move toward less less

374
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:49,869
popular website so to speak yeah we also

375
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,879
looked at a at the data set that was not

376
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:53,529
the top fifty thousand and the issue of

377
00:19:51,879 --> 00:20:00,668
were a little more similar to the fish

378
00:19:53,529 --> 00:20:04,599
in case I just fill in for that last

379
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:07,570
question let's encrypt or the e FF which

380
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:11,349
is behind let's encrypt is well aware

381
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:16,629
that the paid certificate authorities

382
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:21,820
are very much advertising this fact yes

383
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:23,529
they're all aware okay if we don't have

384
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,820
any more questions let's think this

385
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:27,910
speaker again

386
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,909
