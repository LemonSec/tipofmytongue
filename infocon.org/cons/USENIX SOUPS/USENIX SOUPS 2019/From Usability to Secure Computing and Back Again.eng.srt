1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,550
great so I'm Lucy as mentioned our talk

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,759
is call from usability to secure

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,890
computing and back again so to provide

4
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,720
context a few years ago the city of

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,820
Boston wanted to create something called

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,669
the Boston Women's workforce council and

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,070
they had a goal in mind of closing the

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,710
gender wage gap but in order to do so

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,900
they need actual wage data from

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,670
companies in the Boston area and these

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,260
companies view this data as highly

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,170
sensitive information that they don't

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,030
want anyone to see in the clear so what

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,950
was originally proposed was that each

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,020
business would take these spreadsheets

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,329
of very sensitive information and hand

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,670
them on over to a trusted third party

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,320
this trusted third party would then take

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,480
all these spreadsheets aggregate them

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,510
together and provide the proper analysis

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,669
needed however the lawyers involved

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,709
realized that they were weary of any

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,420
entity in the situation getting access

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,550
to that data so they were still worried

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,619
that in the event of a data breach their

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,350
information would still be vulnerable

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,220
and could possibly get compromised so

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,318
because of this the trusted third party

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,690
was also afraid that they would also

30
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,030
face a liability risk of holding that

31
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,910
data and then potentially being sued in

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,920
the event of said data breach so to

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,330
resolve this problem our team used

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,700
something called secure multi-party

35
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,700
computation and this is a cryptographic

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,640
technique that evaluates some function f

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,789
on a set of private inputs and then it

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,069
produces some public output specifically

39
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,080
in our case the private inputs are the

40
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,289
salary data from all these companies and

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,860
the public output is the average salary

42
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:54,509
of men versus women so we have now

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,789
deployed secure multi-party computation

44
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,590
a few times for the study with results

45
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,660
captured in the Boston Women's workforce

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,569
councils reports which you can all read

47
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,860
if you're interested and in the most

48
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,179
recent deployment there were over a

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,340
hundred companies that actually

50
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:11,068
participated in the study and submitted

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,290
their company data and for all of these

52
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,750
100 companies we had to explain the

53
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,879
guarantees of MPC to them and also allow

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,890
for their employees to successfully

55
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,859
submit their data in a user-friendly way

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,339
and due to the privacy preserving

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,810
properties of secure

58
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,910
multi-party computation there are

59
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,910
certain usability challenges that are

60
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,370
introduced when we use this in the real

61
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,530
world so I'm going to discuss what these

62
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,110
usability challenges are and how we've

63
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,819
solved them in our deployment and in the

64
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,799
second half of the talk Peter is going

65
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,329
to talk about how MPC can be used to

66
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,540
improve usability by providing

67
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,650
privacy-preserving web analytics

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,890
specifically he's going to describe our

69
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,629
implementation and how we've actually

70
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,510
how this has allowed us to analyze user

71
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,760
behavior without compromising any of our

72
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,950
original privacy goals or guarantees and

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,530
what this work demonstrates is that it's

74
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,420
possible to measure and then improve

75
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,470
usability of secure web applications

76
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,809
without any additional privacy cost

77
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,209
so as MPC moves from theory to practice

78
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,500
our experiences have shown that MPC

79
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,810
needs to be more accessible to our

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,910
target users they need to understand and

81
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,500
use MPC without mistakes which both

82
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,879
contribute to their trust in our

83
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,310
software's ability to protect their

84
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,429
sensitive data and to produce accurate

85
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,620
results I'm going to highlight three

86
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,260
particular usability challenges one

87
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,780
inspiring trust - error minimization and

88
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,840
three ease of use for more there discuss

89
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,910
in our paper so MPC is not yet used very

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,829
often in practice so score guarantees

91
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,410
and terminology are not necessarily

92
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,030
understood by non domain experts nor are

93
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,730
the concepts that people may ever have

94
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,859
have heard of before so this puts an

95
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,869
additional burden on MPC application

96
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:55,359
developers to convey the guarantees of

97
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,579
MPC to stakeholders and also have them

98
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,739
buy into the idea that MPC actually

99
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,590
works and although we could show our

100
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,599
audience's cryptographic proofs they're

101
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,090
not necessarily accessible to a broader

102
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,608
population so instead we try to draw

103
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,819
analogies or use examples with concrete

104
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:14,200
demonstrations of how MPC works so these

105
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,959
analogies are not meant to actually

106
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,029
explain every intricate detail of MPC

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,130
but they're meant to give audiences

108
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,099
confidence that it's possible to compute

109
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,770
a function on private inputs and not

110
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,450
reveal any of those inputs so we've

111
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,359
accompanied these explanations with this

112
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,770
diagram of our protocol which is a semi

113
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,860
honest additive secret sharing scheme

114
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,150
and although more complex NPC protocols

115
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,890
do exist we chose a comparatively

116
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,349
simpler one since it's easier to explain

117
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,180
to our target audience and I will

118
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,000
demonstrate that by walking you all

119
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,980
through it so we start off with our

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,590
contributors who hold the actual data

121
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,650
and each contributor then generates a

122
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,330
range and mask in the browser and this

123
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,130
random mask is encrypted under the

124
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,380
public key of the analyst at the Boston

125
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,450
Women's workforce council this random

126
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,130
mask then gets sent to the BW w sze

127
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,110
where they can unmask it and then

128
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,820
aggregate it together to create what is

129
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,860
called the aggregate mask so meanwhile

130
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,659
they the addition of the actual data and

131
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,080
the rancher mask produces something

132
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,520
called the mask data and this mask data

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,979
gets sent on to the Boston University

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,990
server where we then compute the

135
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,210
aggregate of these mask pieces of data

136
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,210
and then we have what is called the mask

137
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,159
aggregate data we send the mask a great

138
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,659
data on over to the analyst at the

139
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,910
Boston women's WorkFirst Council and

140
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,220
they now have both sets of aggregate

141
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,500
pieces of information they can subtract

142
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,050
one from another to then arrive at the

143
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,400
actual aggregate data so this is how

144
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,350
we've explained our protocol to our

145
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,380
users and hopefully it's clear to you

146
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,150
all as well so error minimization is

147
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,880
important in general but it's especially

148
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,609
critical in our setting since the inputs

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,620
are private MPC doesn't allow any single

150
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,960
entity to look at that input data which

151
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,790
makes it difficult to detect and correct

152
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,549
invalid input data and to remove

153
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,950
outliers and although we can build in

154
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,590
certain error detection logic and encode

155
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,630
that to run under MPC this increases

156
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,700
performance overhead in ways that may

157
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,190
make the computation infeasible in some

158
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,710
cases and this also requires that we

159
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,660
actually have logic formalized and

160
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,520
written down about the data without

161
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,540
prior knowledge of what the input data

162
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,490
characteristics actually are so we also

163
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,900
want a high participation rate for the

164
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,120
correctness and the validity of the

165
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,520
study but as the number of contributors

166
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,860
increases the chances that at least one

167
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,799
contributor provides incorrect data also

168
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,900
increases all of these issues make it

169
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,940
very critical for us to detect errors

170
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,770
before data submission actually happens

171
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,960
and to make this process as easy as

172
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,060
possible so to reduce the number of

173
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,770
errors we allow users to pre-fill a

174
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,020
spreadsheet that they can upload to the

175
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,030
platform we also proactively provide

176
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,039
feedback to warn users about missing or

177
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,349
out of range data prior to their actual

178
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,759
submission for example we can find out

179
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,919
what the largest company in Boston is

180
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,500
and encode that users can't enter a

181
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,299
number larger than that and finally we

182
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,979
permit users to resubmit their data if

183
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,440
they discover that a previous omission

184
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,659
is wrong and by supporting supporting

185
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,849
resubmission this also influences the

186
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:18,740
underlying MPC protocols we can choose

187
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,500
from since not all of them accommodate

188
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,930
this without modification and here we

189
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,090
have the actual user interface used by

190
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,159
all of our participants and they range

191
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,419
from HR employees at hospitals

192
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:32,659
manufacturing companies universities

193
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,758
tech companies etc and they have a very

194
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,979
wide range of technical expertise as

195
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,840
well as computational resources that are

196
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,789
available to them at their institution

197
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,099
so we've done our best to make this

198
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,960
process as seamless as possible and as

199
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:47,060
you can see it looks like the original

200
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,710
workflow where users just enter their

201
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,300
spreadsheets but the cryptography is

202
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,638
running in the client and it's abstract

203
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,129
apart issah pants so our application

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,530
relies on familiar web interfaces and

205
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:02,240
doesn't require a special setup process

206
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:04,698
or specialized software or hardware so

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,069
in conclusion as MPC moves from theory

208
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,800
to practice usability needs to be a key

209
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,539
emphasis with care put into inspiring

210
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,819
trust in both privacy guarantees and the

211
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:15,500
correctness of the output there also

212
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,229
needs to be focused done on error

213
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,509
checking before data leaves the user and

214
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:26,870
reliance on familiar interfaces that non

215
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:31,610
domain experts already understand thanks

216
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:33,380
Lucy I'm Peter so as Lucy said or she

217
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,719
sort of gave you an overview of the

218
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,070
usability challenges we encountered and

219
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,020
how we tried to address them and

220
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,880
overcome them in order to eventually

221
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,029
deploy this application using

222
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,250
multi-party computation now I would like

223
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,950
to look the reverse direction and ask

224
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,790
how can multi-party computation be used

225
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,980
to actually study and improve usability

226
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,630
so we'll present a sort of proof of

227
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,010
concept design of how to collect

228
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:04,080
usability metrics under NPC so a common

229
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,510
practice in web development is a BTech

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,230
stayin where you test various versions

231
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,270
of a site or a UI design to test the

232
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,270
efficacy or the success of different

233
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,120
design decisions and this in all

234
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,890
applications including Apple

235
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,780
applications with cryptography and

236
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,180
multi-party computation is very helpful

237
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:28,170
to sort of evaluate the successes and

238
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,790
failures of a design common platforms

239
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,890
that help you do this are things like

240
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,829
Mixpanel and Google Analytics which

241
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,780
provide helpful information for this

242
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,850
they also provide lots of other

243
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,770
information about user interaction on a

244
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,590
website and in fact they might even

245
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,990
track users outside of the particular

246
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,450
application that's using them some of

247
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,600
these services even go so far as to

248
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,830
recreate entire user sessions where an

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
application developer could see

250
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,570
everywhere a person clicked and scrolled

251
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,120
and navigated etc so while this is

252
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,340
potentially very useful information for

253
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,990
evaluating and changing the design of a

254
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,100
website it's definitely not

255
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,470
privacy-preserving

256
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:12,360
there's a lot of user level input and

257
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:14,070
individual data that we particularly do

258
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,600
not want to collect we specifically

259
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,770
don't want to collect any user level

260
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,840
data as lucy detailed we spent a lot of

261
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,300
time explaining to people the privacy

262
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,640
guarantees of MPC and convincing them to

263
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,410
use this application so we don't want to

264
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,870
undermine their understanding and their

265
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,939
trust by introducing web analytics

266
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,480
platforms that might collect individual

267
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,580
level data but as I said it is very

268
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,120
useful data for improving design or

269
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,580
study in design so as we have this NPC

270
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,810
back-end in place we thought to

271
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,580
introduce usability metrics into the

272
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,430
private inputs of this computation so

273
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,000
that we can get at least aggregate level

274
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,859
usability metrics out on the other side

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,170
we implemented this in the system to add

276
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,850
specific usability metrics that we

277
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,920
thought would be helpful for evaluating

278
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:10,170
our design and our our application so

279
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,020
specifically we chose to focus on what

280
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:16,410
browser people were using the amount of

281
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,520
time they spend on various portions of

282
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,560
the website

283
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,230
whether or not they use specific UI

284
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,849
features such as the drag-and-drop file

285
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,630
upload or whether people chose to

286
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,670
manually enter their data and we also

287
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,290
counted the number of errors that they

288
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,510
encountered wall inputting data whether

289
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,860
their value was negative or not a number

290
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:41,189
or two large things like that and so all

291
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,740
of this was used to collect this data

292
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,540
without collecting any individual level

293
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,410
data so the output of the process is

294
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,660
still only aggregate and not individual

295
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,630
we use this to run a study across three

296
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,740
different versions of the application

297
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,320
and I'll show you briefly what they

298
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,750
looked like so the very first design of

299
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,200
the website is like this and as you can

300
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,390
see there are red and yellow markers for

301
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,270
if your data is potentially invalid or

302
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:12,000
not going to be accepted at all the

303
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,579
second design that we tested is this

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,530
which is very similar and there's a

305
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,690
tooltip next to this red box which

306
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,000
explains why the data might be invalid

307
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,340
or incorrect so people can understand

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,810
how to correct it the third version of

309
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,680
the application that we tested and

310
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:30,599
compared is when we introduced the

311
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,560
drag-and-drop file upload so people

312
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,150
could offline compiled their data and

313
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,800
input it into a spreadsheet and then

314
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,370
just upload it and not have to manually

315
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,520
enter every cell so we ran this study

316
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,500
with about 150 people and to demonstrate

317
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,079
what sort of data you could collect from

318
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,650
a system like this here's a graph of the

319
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,570
errors broken down by which version of

320
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,120
the application people were using so

321
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,390
this graph shows that the most recent

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,420
version of the application with the file

323
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,540
upload feature users encountered the

324
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,060
fewest errors and again as a

325
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,920
demonstration here's a graph of each

326
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,260
version of the website and how long

327
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,630
people took on average to use the

328
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,600
application and submit the data so here

329
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:22,830
actually the most recent version took

330
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,050
people the longest to use so this

331
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,110
process obviously has some limitations

332
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,030
one of those is that it limits the

333
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,720
statistics and the granularity of the

334
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,420
data you can

335
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,360
lect for example in our case we only

336
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,910
collected averages and we couldn't see

337
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,220
if all of the errors in one group were

338
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,129
produced by one user and if that was

339
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,149
representative of the whole group or not

340
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:49,259
another limitation is that the

341
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:52,920
application already needs to support MPC

342
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:54,959
in our case we had two parties already

343
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,849
set up Boston University and the Boston

344
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,099
Women's workforce council that were

345
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,220
prepared to receive and compute over

346
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,540
this shared data but in many web

347
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,970
applications where they're only

348
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,689
interacting with one server this would

349
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,480
not be possible so to end I'd like to

350
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:15,149
show this graphic again and emphasize

351
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,379
that these two ideas or these two fields

352
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:20,870
of usability and secure computation can

353
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:25,250
enhance and collaborate with each other

354
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:28,230
our deployment really benefited from

355
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:31,230
looki focusing on design and usability

356
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,259
early on particularly with things like

357
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,509
error minimization and resubmission for

358
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:38,160
example in the most recent deployment we

359
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,720
had we received an email from a

360
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,199
contributor or the Boston Women's

361
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,660
workforce council dude who said oh could

362
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,579
I please resubmit my data I just wanted

363
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,819
to try out the application so I uploaded

364
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:52,739
random data and without the ability to

365
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:54,180
resubmit we wouldn't have been able to

366
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,970
detect this and that would have affected

367
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,910
the validity of the output data or the

368
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,490
correctness of the output data and on

369
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,230
the other hand these techniques in

370
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,769
multi-party computation and secure

371
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,559
computation can be used to add usability

372
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:13,110
features or usability studies to

373
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,449
applications without introducing new

374
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:18,930
privacy cost or compromising any privacy

375
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:21,059
guarantees so this relevant UI data can

376
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,500
be collected without sacrificing that or

377
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:27,000
exposing any individual users data thank

378
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,910
you all for listening I'd like to also

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,529
thank our other collaborators and if any

380
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,389
of you are interested in doing a similar

381
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,610
deployment or just seeing some of the

382
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,950
work we did all of the

383
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:47,610
code is open source and online I'm

384
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:51,529
github thank you very much okay any

385
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,529
questions from the audience

386
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,620
hi I really appreciate your talk and

387
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,050
somebody with a multi-party computing

388
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,540
background thinking about usability my

389
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,029
question is about the fact that the two

390
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,399
things at the very top about trust and

391
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,439
validity of the results I'm gonna tell

392
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,790
you as a data scientist if I'm doing

393
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,260
anything with data I don't trust

394
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,969
anything until I see it with my eyes

395
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,910
that it's clean because data is so so

396
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,459
messy and so erroneous so what is your

397
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,430
thought in the ability for in a system

398
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:25,369
like this to give a few chips to each

399
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,410
submitter so that they can actually

400
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,209
really trust actually so this has to do

401
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,069
with trusting that algorithms will

402
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,839
always be perfect regardless of what

403
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,920
goes in that's just not something I have

404
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,380
so if rather than saying you know just

405
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,719
trust us we got this just trust that

406
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,240
this doesn't work for a data scientist

407
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,950
so if you have the ability to give the

408
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,500
data science some Peaks

409
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,240
so that they can actually look that the

410
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,640
fact that I put this in it's coming out

411
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,770
at the other end that I think that's the

412
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,720
start of data scientists wanting to even

413
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,670
think about using multi-part multi-party

414
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,670
computing and I was wondering if you had

415
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:08,069
any thoughts on that yes so one thing

416
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:10,770
that is possible would be something like

417
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,069
doing sampling under MPC to see that a

418
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,059
small portion of the output is

419
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:18,418
statistically representative of the

420
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:23,668
larger output but specifically in our

421
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:25,530
case we've you know we've guaranteed to

422
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,270
the companies that no individual

423
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,190
company's data will be seen by anyone

424
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,860
because that's a potential privacy leak

425
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,960
that they're not willing to accept in

426
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,500
terms of the validity of the data going

427
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,809
in that's part of why we've focused so

428
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,150
much on having the input be very

429
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,879
standard and something that users are

430
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,340
familiar with for example most of the

431
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,080
data they submit is in a format that

432
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,779
they compile data for for the

433
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,879
Yosi maybe Lucy can fill in on what that

434
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,769
acronym stands for the Equal Employment

435
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,529
Opportunity office there we go

436
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,630
yeah something about sorry so we hope

437
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:02,250
that that data is consistent with or

438
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,760
their data is consistent across there

439
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,470
was two forms and will hopefully be

440
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,539
correct in that input and aside from

441
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,279
that when it comes to output validity

442
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,559
right now we're just capturing the

443
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,909
average but that average still matches

444
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,519
up with statistics that we've seen

445
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:20,279
across the country so if we look back at

446
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:23,010
the results like what they've seen is

447
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:25,110
that the wage gap is around 76 cents for

448
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,190
women compared to men in the Boston area

449
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:31,049
and that actually is a underestimate of

450
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,580
or sorry it's worse than what they

451
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,200
actually anticipated for Boston they

452
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,870
thought it was more likely around 80

453
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,549
cents so the output validity is close

454
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,580
enough to what they would expect that I

455
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:45,510
think that also helps with getting trust

456
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,668
in the computation itself and also right

457
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,490
now we are just looking at the average

458
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,870
but in the next in the next employment

459
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,000
we've also added things like standard

460
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,489
deviation and I think as time moves on

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,980
we can make that computation more robust

462
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,990
by enhancing it but it does come with a

463
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,190
trade-off of performance overhead so

464
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,840
those are things that were working on we

465
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,820
have time for one more great thanks

466
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,830
Chris Kemoeatu I see I'm really excited

467
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,450
to see MPC going into the real world

468
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,970
like this I'm wondering kind of at a

469
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,960
very high level the these questions are

470
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,370
you're going to be asking and saying oh

471
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,139
we're gonna guarantee your privacy no

472
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,559
one will ever see that you actually lied

473
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:24,600
about these numbers so like is there

474
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,269
some kind of like threshold level

475
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,139
trapdoor that you could say like oh if

476
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:30,210
everything looks how I basically

477
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,500
understand it then everybody's happy

478
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,809
this is how it's gonna work but there

479
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,789
are motivations to lie because you know

480
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,220
no one is looking but if you could say

481
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,529
oh well if we have this idea somebody's

482
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,409
lying I could say oh well five of these

483
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:45,480
15 companies all agree to say yes we

484
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:47,820
would like to deep-lined the rest is

485
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,279
there any sort of option to do some deep

486
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,678
blinding to kind of make sure that the

487
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,919
true numbers are being submitted yes so

488
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,200
not yet so something that we have seen

489
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,929
is that the like I mentioned the numbers

490
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,150
are a lot worse than we thought so if

491
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:04,070
companies had inside

492
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,560
to lie and say they participated in this

493
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,270
compact they would likely want to say oh

494
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,370
look we're not so bad after all

495
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,200
everything's fine but in fact it's the

496
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,550
opposite the numbers just look a lot

497
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,640
worse than like people would have

498
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:18,919
initially predicted so also I think a

499
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,530
key reason why companies participate now

500
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,390
is that they don't want the results

501
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,950
attributed back to them so they don't

502
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,810
want anyone to know that they've

503
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,850
contributed to the data so that they can

504
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,590
still say we're in this broader compact

505
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,780
but we didn't actually contribute to

506
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,110
this particular deployment so don't look

507
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,879
at us it's not our data but yeah we have

508
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,590
not explored something like the blinding

509
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,870
idea you discuss thank you

510
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:47,230
okay let's think the speakers yet again

511
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:47,229
[Applause]
