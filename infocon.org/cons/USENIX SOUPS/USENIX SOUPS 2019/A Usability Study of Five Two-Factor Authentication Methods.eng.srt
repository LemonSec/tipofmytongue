1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,520
so I'm excited on our research we did a

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,439
comparative study of five different two

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,200
authentication methods so I'm grateful

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,910
for Simon he explained u2f really well

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,029
so then you'll understand that in my

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,800
presentation so passwords they're

7
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,450
everywhere but this audience knows that

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,250
they're just simply not enough there's

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,890
so much evidence that shows the weakness

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,050
of passwords and so many organizations

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,210
have turned to two-factor authentication

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:43,129
as a means of augmenting that weak

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,720
password which two-factor you have to

14
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,710
have two of these three categories so

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,989
there's something you know which is

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,809
typically a password something you have

17
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,150
such as a phone or a u2f device and

18
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:56,510
something you are so biometrics such as

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,460
a face ID or a fingerprint so in

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,650
particular the five two-factor

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,650
authentication methods that we studied

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,408
or the SMS message totp are the

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,048
time-based one-time password

24
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:12,770
pre-generated codes push notifications

25
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:14,450
and the u2f security keys so each of

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,390
these five there five of the most common

27
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,760
second factors and they all fall into

28
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,829
this something you have category so the

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,009
first image you'll see is a paper that

30
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:26,809
represents the pre-generated codes you

31
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,719
can also store those codes on your

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,909
computer or on a thumb drive by in our

33
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,820
study we printed those codes and the

34
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:38,270
phone is used for the SMS messages the

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,908
push notifications and the totp and then

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:45,319
for the u2f device we studied the

37
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,450
Yubikey in Parc in particular so our

38
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,240
goal was to perform a comparative

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,429
usability study of these five 2fa

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,429
methods and we built on a lot of great

41
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:58,069
previous work and so about a decade ago

42
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:00,759
there were a group of 2fa banking

43
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:03,649
studies that mostly took place in the UK

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,420
and they had mostly negative results and

45
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,050
part of that was maybe because it was a

46
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,990
decade ago so but that's a good it was

47
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,600
good thing for us to base on then there

48
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:18,260
have been recently some more studies das

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,200
at all studied the set up of security

50
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,579
keys on Google and they made some

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,820
recommendations that Google used and

52
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,710
implemented and improve their design the

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,680
stay that's most similar to ours is a

54
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,500
smile and all

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,760
they set up four of the five two-factor

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,260
authentication methods that we're

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,060
studying on Google and they interesting

58
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,069
interesting Lee we found the same order

59
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,069
of which were the most usable in which

60
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,760
were the least usable for our sus scores

61
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:50,250
but they had more negative results than

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,319
we found and part of that may be due to

63
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,420
the fact that in between their study and

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,339
our study Google mate did make some

65
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,670
changes to that setup process so that's

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,560
encouraging and finally there have been

67
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,589
some studies on the day to day usability

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,650
of security keys including the talk that

69
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,599
you just heard about so building on

70
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,609
these previous studies we designed a

71
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,310
study to compare five factors across a

72
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,049
single application and using a single

73
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,329
application helps reduce some of the

74
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,980
confounding factors that comes when

75
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,750
you're trying to compare one second

76
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,018
factor on one application with another

77
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,780
on a totally different application this

78
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,430
also allowed us to gather timing data so

79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,120
we could see how long it took the users

80
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,620
to authenticate with their second factor

81
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,650
the second thing we did for our study is

82
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,239
we examined the setup and day-to-day

83
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,769
usability independently which is

84
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,169
something that Reynolds at all did is

85
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,879
one study Yubikey and the same way that

86
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,669
Simon did in the talk we just heard and

87
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,948
this helps avoid bias if a user has a

88
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,090
really poor set up experience they're

89
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:56,849
likely going to rate the day-to-day

90
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:58,620
usability and much lower so we have two

91
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,679
parts the two parts to our study the

92
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,859
first we did a two-week between subject

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,489
usability study where each group was

94
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:10,440
assigned a different a second factor and

95
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,690
they authenticated that with over the

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,299
period of two weeks the second part was

97
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,579
a within subjects setup study where

98
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,639
every participant set up each of the

99
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,260
five authentication methods so I'll go

100
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,150
over the two-week study first and then

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,020
I'll talk about what we learned through

102
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,729
the setup study we recruited 72

103
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,770
participants and we divided them into

104
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,110
six groups one for each of the second

105
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,669
factors and then another control group

106
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,760
which used only passwords to

107
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,289
authenticate and we created a simulated

108
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,380
online banking website

109
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,450
and then over the course of two weeks we

110
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,310
had them complete twelve making tasks

111
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,610
and they could complete no more than one

112
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,800
task a day during the initial meeting we

113
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,360
set up the second factor with him again

114
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,010
so that they would not have to have a

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,800
poor or good experience with that that

116
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,659
could bias our results and then after

117
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,280
the two-week period we had an exit

118
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,020
interview where we asked a series of

119
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,179
open-ended questions we have two sorts

120
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,539
of findings our quantitative findings

121
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,790
come from timing data and suss scores

122
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,220
that we gathered and our qualitative

123
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,110
data comes from the themes that we

124
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,100
identified as a part of those exit

125
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,780
interviews so there was quite a bit of

126
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,720
variance in the timing data but also a

127
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,659
lot of overlap so the fastest second

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,910
factor by far was the u2f device which

129
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,790
had a median time of about nine seconds

130
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,610
and the longest was the printed codes

131
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:43,450
which was also really close to the SMS

132
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,940
messaging one thing to note this is the

133
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,340
time that this the time started after

134
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,260
user entered their password and the time

135
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,750
ended after they authenticated with the

136
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,610
second factor so we don't know that this

137
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,470
time includes time it may have taken

138
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,180
someone to go get their second factor if

139
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,180
they didn't have it immediately on them

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,580
our another thing that we looked at was

141
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,979
individual learnability within timing so

142
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,229
we wanted to know as users become more

143
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,750
familiar with this particular second

144
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,550
factor will it increase the speed which

145
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,830
with which they can authenticate and

146
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,650
this was true in the case of push

147
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,140
notifications and u2f so that's also

148
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,510
encouraging to know maybe if at first a

149
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,849
user feels like it takes too long they

150
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,289
can speed up with a system if they

151
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,330
weren't familiar with it at first as

152
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:36,550
they learn more about the system our

153
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,169
here are soft scores which there was a

154
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:43,090
lot of variants as well obviously

155
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,090
passwords perform the best with a median

156
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,250
score of 95 which is as we expected

157
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,530
after that the best performing second

158
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,110
factor was TOTP which had a median score

159
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,530
of about 88 and the lowest two

160
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,610
where the SMS and the u2f so something

161
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,888
that's interesting about this you'll

162
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,129
notice in the last slide u2f had the

163
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:06,280
fastest time to authenticate but it had

164
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,050
the lowest sus score median saw score so

165
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,789
that shows that timing is not

166
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,020
necessarily the thing that users care

167
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:15,460
most about when it comes to the

168
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,340
usability of second factors our

169
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,229
qualitative results come we had two

170
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,109
coders code each interview and identify

171
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:25,690
common themes which I'll talk about now

172
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,419
the first theme is the trade-off between

173
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,280
security and inconvenience so this

174
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,049
participant said in my opinion it may be

175
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,400
a little obsessive for everything but

176
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,430
for banking it's something that I

177
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,609
actually do want some authentication so

178
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,949
29% of people we surveyed said security

179
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,009
was definitely worth the inconvenience

180
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,419
cost and another 36% said it would

181
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,849
depend on the importance of the account

182
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:50,919
so that's 65 percent of users who said

183
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:55,120
at least in some circumstances we want

184
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:57,370
to FA which is encouraging another theme

185
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,020
we identified was that the availability

186
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,969
of second factor devices this

187
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,979
participant said honestly once I'm home

188
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,569
I kind of just set my phone down and

189
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,490
forget where I put it sometime so that

190
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,580
was a little bit hard I needed to go

191
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,889
find my phone and pull up the app and 35

192
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,990
percent of our users mentioned at least

193
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,830
once not having their second factor

194
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,599
device immediately available this could

195
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,279
be more common among personal users

196
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,279
which is the setting that we tested this

197
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,900
in because maybe for work

198
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,419
many people are required to have a

199
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,279
second factor device in order to do

200
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,468
their work whether a smart card or a u2f

201
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,120
device whereas at home people might not

202
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:38,409
want to have that second factor on them

203
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,448
all the time and then we identified as

204
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,130
has been talked about previously in this

205
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,478
conference that many participants just

206
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,980
feel like they're not a target this

207
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,050
participant said I mean you hear a lot

208
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,850
about stuff being broken into I just

209
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,620
don't think I have anything that people

210
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,209
would want to take from me so I think

211
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,839
that's why I haven't been very worried

212
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:58,180
about it so it's true that most the

213
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,120
average user is not going to be targeted

214
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,410
by a targeted phishing attack but

215
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,850
hackers are happy to have anyone's

216
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,890
credentials whether they're a billion or

217
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,990
not so this is just more evidence that

218
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,130
we need to educate

219
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:15,410
users on the dangers of account

220
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,880
compromised but all in all we were

221
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,160
surprised and encouraged and thought

222
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,040
that on the most part the day to day

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,620
usability was pretty good so for each of

224
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,089
those five sus scores the median score

225
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,959
was higher than what's considered

226
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:34,200
average which is a score of 68 or 70 so

227
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,029
we were really encouraged by that we do

228
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,920
have a few limitations so we studied the

229
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,790
university population and that is not

230
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,589
representative of all population also

231
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,079
using a simulated banking environment

232
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:48,180
instead of a real banking environment

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,870
may have changed the way that the users

234
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,099
used to FA we also recognized that it

235
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,990
would have been different if we had used

236
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
a social media environment or an

237
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,990
environment where users may not have

238
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,970
felt to FA was as important many in the

239
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,830
real world many organizations offer a

240
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,870
remember me option which we did not

241
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,820
option we did not offer because we

242
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,480
wanted users to authenticate on every

243
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,029
attempt and so in that way our study is

244
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,089
different than how to FA might work in

245
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:20,070
the wild so we had really encouraging

246
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,709
results for our day to day study and we

247
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,660
wanted to then see are there major setup

248
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,930
hurdles that might prevent someone from

249
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,750
using the fairly good use day to day

250
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,750
usability of these methods for a set up

251
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,610
study we recruited 30 participants and

252
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,950
we used counter balancing to account for

253
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,480
ordering effects as each participant

254
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,440
when she went through each of the five

255
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,360
methods we used Google as kind of a case

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,279
study we didn't want to study one

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,630
provider in particular but Google has

258
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,300
been known to have relatively good

259
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,420
security and usability and so we wanted

260
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:59,399
to just study them as an example of can

261
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:02,310
set up and be implemented well so we

262
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,500
measured timing data for how long it

263
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,229
took each participant to set up and this

264
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,870
the set-up time varied much more than

265
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,029
the day-to-day authentication time with

266
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,190
totp being the highest a median

267
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,070
authentic error set-up time of 84

268
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,290
seconds over a minute the codes you

269
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,790
might notice is very very small that's

270
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,380
because all you have to do is click up

271
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,510
and those codes are automatically

272
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,610
generated for you so we did not include

273
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,410
in this timing date at the time it would

274
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,390
have took for participants to print out

275
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,310
these codes or store them somewhere on a

276
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,230
device because that would vary widely

277
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,209
based on what the participant wanted to

278
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:42,420
do or even what kind of printer that

279
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:44,520
they had so the timing data differed we

280
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,010
also instead of doing a sus score to

281
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,290
measure each of the five for the set up

282
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,390
we chose to use the single east question

283
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,640
instead which is a single question

284
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,650
measured measuring perceived usability

285
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,660
on a scale of one to seven with one

286
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,970
being very difficult and seven very easy

287
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,829
and we did this so that we could avoid a

288
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,190
survey fatigue since each participant

289
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:10,770
had to measure five different second

290
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:14,070
factors interestingly totp which had the

291
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:17,040
highest sus score had the lowest seq

292
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,050
score here so this is something that can

293
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,140
show us if we can get past a poor set up

294
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,250
for totp then day-to-day usability can

295
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,480
be much higher and a great experience

296
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:30,960
for many users but even so we were

297
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,970
surprised that in general the for every

298
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,550
one of the five factors there were more

299
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,450
positive than negative scores for the

300
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:41,969
seq score and for you to F&T OTP which

301
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,920
had those two one which is the worst

302
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,080
score on the bottom we think that those

303
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,000
poor scores might be explained by the

304
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,540
set up failures which occurred twice

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,420
with TOTP and twice for you to F so for

306
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,310
the TOTP these errors came when a

307
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,099
participant attempted to scan a QR code

308
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,189
with their camera app rather than first

309
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,960
downloading the Google Authenticator app

310
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,460
so the instructions did say you must

311
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,260
download the Authenticator app before

312
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,610
you scan this code but a lot of

313
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,350
participants don't read it as soon as

314
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,710
they see a QR code they just wanted to

315
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,750
scan that and for the u2f the failures

316
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,060
both occurred when there's a pop-up

317
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,130
permission that comes up and asks if

318
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,949
Google can see the make and model of the

319
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,660
u2f device and but because maybe because

320
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,390
the participants were unfamiliar with

321
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,850
the u2f device they had to look at the

322
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,740
device to touch the button and so they

323
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,110
missed the pop-up on the screen and then

324
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,680
were unaware of how to proceed

325
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,030
so both of these failures were probably

326
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,530
avoidable with a different set of design

327
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,860
and so we do make some recommendations

328
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:47,910
for Google in our paper which you can

329
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:51,240
read all in all again we were pleasantly

330
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:54,030
surprised with how in general the users

331
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,960
found the set up usability to be again

332
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,850
it was a university population another

333
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,520
thing we did not intend to study gules

334
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,250
specific implementation but because we

335
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,500
chose Google as our case study their

336
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,680
implementation obviously had an effect

337
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,150
on our results we did not want our final

338
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,189
limitation we wanted we did not want

339
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,930
participants to give us personal

340
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,240
information so we provided them with a

341
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,060
phone which may have increased the time

342
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,250
that this setup took because they were

343
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,780
unfamiliar with how the phone worked if

344
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,370
they were it was an Android phone if

345
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,470
they had an iOS some of them were not as

346
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,340
familiar and they were also unfamiliar

347
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,710
with the phone number so in conclusion

348
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,200
our major takeaways the biggest one is

349
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,600
that well implemented two FA methods may

350
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,420
be used and set up without major

351
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,820
difficulty at least for a university

352
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,750
populations or similar populations so

353
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,640
this represents progress compared to

354
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,370
many earlier studies which have had kind

355
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,410
of some mixed results and so I think

356
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,150
that as a community were kind of ready

357
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,069
to move on to other populations

358
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,840
yesterday we talked about the elderly

359
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,610
and the visually impaired and other

360
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,620
groups and test how two-factor

361
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,620
authentication is it usable enough for

362
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,360
these groups we found that home users

363
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,520
might not always have access to their

364
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,440
second factor devices we found that

365
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,710
users differentiate quite a bit between

366
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,320
low and high value accounts and we found

367
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,470
that for you to F and T OTP that time to

368
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,610
authenticate decreases as familiar

369
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,220
familiarity with the methods increases

370
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,560
and finally we found that faster

371
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,530
authentication doesn't necessarily mean

372
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,760
a higher usability thank you for your

373
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,939
attention and I'm happy to take any

374
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,939
questions

375
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:45,319
I think he that was very interesting I

376
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,060
have a couple of questions you mentioned

377
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,940
as US school

378
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,369
what could you explain what that is yes

379
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,050
so that's the standard usability it's a

380
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,190
questionnaire with which has ten

381
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,449
questions and it's a really good

382
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:03,160
standard way to measure perceived

383
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:05,960
usability so for example for our Yubikey

384
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,030
for its day to day usability we got a

385
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,250
score of 73 which happened to be the

386
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,800
exact same score that Simon got in this

387
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:25,310
last paper so it's fairly consistent a

388
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:28,040
standard usability questionnaire yeah so

389
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,260
we we hosted it online so participants

390
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,240
would go to a website it looks like a

391
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,750
banking app you can make transfers and

392
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,150
you can make deposits but it was fake

393
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:45,860
money yeah but it was just like a normal

394
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:48,199
website we didn't use an app we did test

395
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,380
one thing we did do for the sus course

396
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,900
we had one sus score for the banking

397
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,580
website and another sus score for the

398
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,110
second factor and that was to mitigate

399
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,360
if somebody had a bad experience with

400
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,010
the usability of the website that they

401
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,980
would hopefully put that in the first

402
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,810
sass questionnaire thank you you're

403
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,920
welcome

404
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,300
hello this is a lovely initiative from

405
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,740
do security guys want to say thank you

406
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,000
for this research is really interesting

407
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,280
to someone who works at a two-factor

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,470
authentication company one thing I was

409
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,940
wondering is if you happen to before

410
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,560
separating individuals into these

411
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,480
different factoring but this did you ask

412
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,220
what method they have used in the past

413
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,200
and what they familiar with and then the

414
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,300
second question is did you kind of

415
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,160
measure retry rates or failure rates as

416
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,020
time progresses people use these factor

417
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,350
methods yes so that's a great question

418
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,210
we did not ask which if they had used

419
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,280
two factor authentication before which

420
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,370
is a another limitation of our study

421
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,230
that would be a really great thing to do

422
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,550
in a future study and could you repeat

423
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,890
your second question the second question

424
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,620
was like you talked to how in terms of

425
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,360
push in d2f people

426
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,919
time talking the cake decreased as time

427
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,330
went on and I was wondering it because

428
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,520
you kind of owned the service side did

429
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,080
you check to see if people's failure

430
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,639
rates also decreased in terms of

431
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,580
especially like entering codes or

432
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,560
timeouts as time went on yeah we did not

433
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,780
check that that would be another good

434
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,850
thing to often to look at in the future

435
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:13,030
yeah cool thank you thank you hello this

436
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,370
is a very interesting study and thank

437
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,160
you for the work and presentation and

438
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:21,370
the use of standard measures so we did a

439
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,230
study that we only present in two days

440
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,159
ago so obviously it could not have

441
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,110
influenced revert to factoring with

442
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,500
older people and we found with a

443
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:36,520
population of active retirees it took

444
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,210
them a fifty-two minutes on average to

445
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,340
deal with two-factor authentication so

446
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,370
and then I mean they and some of these

447
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,850
had people had you know compute general

448
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:53,350
computer skills but what they they they

449
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:55,330
also had was a more accurate perception

450
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,620
of risk because they were really afraid

451
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:02,470
of access to their bank and so some of

452
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,199
the work that was presented earlier so

453
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:09,580
actually by the person behind me in life

454
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,160
talked about measuring risk perception

455
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,770
and how that might drive adoption

456
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,060
services so I'm gonna leave that

457
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:22,770
question to her but the the different

458
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:26,770
populations have in our experience

459
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:29,560
wildly different experiences I mean

460
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:32,950
literally it was like a three-hour

461
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:37,360
interview with an hour of that getting

462
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:39,850
the two factors set up so I think yes

463
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,830
yet we've got to talk about people who

464
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,379
are older people have cognitive limits

465
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,409
people who have physical limits and

466
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,250
visualization so I encourage your thank

467
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,250
you I really appreciate that

468
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,939
hi I'm Sarah airmen from Carnegie Mellon

469
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,420
thank you for your talk I think there

470
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,760
are a lot of parallels between our work

471
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,040
here

472
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,720
one thing I was curious about is both of

473
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,090
us mentioned that people had trouble

474
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,160
with risk assessment understanding how

475
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,649
account compromise works and how likely

476
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,200
they are to experience it and we both

477
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,420
mentioned that users should be educated

478
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,429
more about that I was wondering if you

479
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,700
had any ideas about how we do that

480
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:26,160
because I think it's a really a problem

481
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,320
that's really resistant to any

482
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,480
interventions I can think of because of

483
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,059
just how humans assess risk

484
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,530
that's a ideas yeah no that's a great

485
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,149
question I know there's been some

486
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:39,020
previous work talking about the

487
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:43,020
effectiveness of videos kind of like

488
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:45,720
scaring users into adopting 2fa and I

489
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,879
don't know if that's the best way we've

490
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,540
also we did it recently a study of

491
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,730
adopting duo to FA at our University and

492
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,530
found a similar thing that just many

493
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,910
users felt like they had no idea why

494
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,309
they had to adopt this and didn't feel

495
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:02,160
like their account was at risk and so I

496
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:04,918
think our university has tried to put

497
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,549
out some messaging that kind of explains

498
