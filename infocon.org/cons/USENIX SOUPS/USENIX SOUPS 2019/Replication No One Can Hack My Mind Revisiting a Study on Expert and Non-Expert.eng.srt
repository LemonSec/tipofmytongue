1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,920
and welcome everyone together with your

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:22,360
Yaffa and Matthew Smith I did this work

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,700
on replicating a study on security

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,460
practice and advice

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,119
what we did was replicating a service

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,070
paper from 2015 by julia iron Rob Reider

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,080
in sunny consult oh no one connect the

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,739
mind comparing expert and non expert

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,760
security practices the study was about

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,629
self-reported security behavior and

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,059
rating of advice and what we did was

12
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:48,099
replicated it as closely as possible but

13
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:51,580
we found a slight flaw in study

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:55,330
methodology which we also improved upon

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:58,510
so little spoiler about the results most

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,360
topics are still relevant the details

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,979
have changed and our improvement of

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,950
methodology allows us to identify

19
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:10,120
concrete fields of action where we as

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:13,299
the usable usable security community can

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,930
hook into so the original study

22
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:19,560
consisted of a four path survey which

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:23,469
was constructed after a pilot study with

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,079
security experts the study consisted of

25
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:28,869
free text entries on security advice and

26
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,399
practice then some closed ended

27
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,130
questions and own security privacy

28
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,579
habits and the main part was rating

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:40,509
pre-formulated advice targeted at

30
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,880
non-expert users the office published

31
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,710
two different versions one for

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,579
non-experts which was hosted on MTurk

33
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:52,380
and one survey for experts which were

34
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:55,508
recruited by the google security block

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,270
so they found out that the only common

36
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:00,100
ground was strong passwords and in

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,048
general the expert advice that was

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,020
seemed as valuable could be grouped into

39
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,920
software updates and her virus password

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,990
management and mindfulness as you can

41
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,899
probably expect non expert practices

42
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:19,210
received mixed rating by experts I would

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,660
go into detail later and three major

44
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,110
fields of practice were not followed by

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,880
non experts all

46
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,560
the experts recommended it it was

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,910
installing system updates using a

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,510
password manager and activating

49
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:35,600
two-factor off so regarding the

50
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:39,290
methodology this first blob of text is

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,150
an actual question and it asks experts

52
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,209
to raid advice in terms of both

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,000
effectiveness and realism how likely the

54
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,980
user can follow it as you may notice

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,020
this is a compound question which is

56
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,640
usually not advised

57
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,130
according to good survey design

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,380
practices so we did a pre study with

59
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,079
interviews based on the survey at the

60
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,420
Siebert trade fair in 2018 which

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,190
confirmed our worries that the

62
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,140
participants had mixed our priorities

63
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,780
and meanings and yeah we're a bit

64
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,540
confused by the question design so we

65
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,900
decided to test this and an a/b testing

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,340
setup because we also wanted to test how

67
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,489
the the results replicate over time we

68
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,170
chose two expert groups and the a group

69
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,120
had the original study design with a

70
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,160
compound question and the B group

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,350
received a separate questions for

72
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,840
effectiveness and realism so we

73
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,459
recruited our non experts 3m truck with

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,080
the same recruitment criteria as the

75
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,600
original work

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,269
we also recruited the same number as the

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,609
original authors our sample was slightly

78
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,180
different but mostly the same

79
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:59,420
we had about half the participants were

80
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,780
female about 80% were younger than 45

81
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,488
and 66% were employed full-time the

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,030
numbers and parent theses are from the

83
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,470
original work expert recruitment turned

84
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,930
out a bit more difficult since we didn't

85
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,080
have access to the Google security block

86
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,180
we asked for permission to post this for

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,978
the sake of replication but our request

88
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,680
got denied sadly so we had to resort to

89
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:27,260
social media and snowball sampling which

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,000
was mainly conducted through Twitter

91
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:36,289
reddit and topical mailing lists so we

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,460
only got 75 experts as opposed to 231

93
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:41,719
which the original order

94
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,390
others could recruit and 44 of those

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,270
experts resist the original design with

96
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,650
the comp our questions and thirty-one

97
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,729
experts received the group were in the

98
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:55,760
group B with a split questions so extra

99
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,640
population has also changed the sample

100
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,990
is slightly more female with 9% which is

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,840
still very sad 79% of our expert

102
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,810
participants were younger than 45 and

103
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,560
71% worked in industry the location has

104
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,090
also changed I will come to that later

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,170
because we had to recruit based on our

106
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:21,440
personal contact the location was very

107
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,600
you heavy with about 70% the original

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,250
authors didn't report numbers on that in

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,950
their paper and they certainly weren't

110
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,280
able to share the raw data with us so we

111
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:34,630
only know about the u.s. portion which

112
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,099
was 47 percent in the original work and

113
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:42,590
727 percent in our replication we also

114
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,810
lowered the bar a bit for having been

115
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,200
counted as an expert it was a

116
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:51,470
closed-ended question with brackets of

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,800
experience and in the original study

118
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,710
only experts with five or more years of

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,430
experience were categorized as actual

120
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,710
experts but we lowered that to include

121
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,930
also the bracket of one to five years of

122
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,250
experience and security or related field

123
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,990
since we didn't see any any differences

124
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:16,760
in the data so this is the first part

125
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,960
what are the top three things you do to

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,700
stay safe online the dark bars are the

127
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,430
experts and the white bars are the non

128
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,580
experts on the left is the original

129
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,560
study and when you look closely you see

130
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,010
that although the order has changed a

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,340
bit the most important topics are still

132
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:40,610
there using a password manager is the

133
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:44,659
most important security practice as of

134
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,180
today according to our experts slight

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,020
changes in boarding result from

136
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:55,419
different coding we we coded these open

137
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,690
answers with two from a three office and

138
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:02,060
we built the codes new so we only

139
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,289
aligned them with the original codebook

140
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:11,539
later on so there might be differences

141
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:13,940
in formulation or encoding as we have

142
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,068
summarized updates and the original

143
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,819
authors differentiated between system

144
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,860
objects and application updates some

145
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,069
practices have gone such as deleting

146
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,979
cookies or using Linux as a security

147
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,840
advice while others have emerged most

148
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:32,870
suitably using script or ad blockers

149
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,568
which is in position four and using a

150
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,960
VPN however nobody actually explained

151
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:44,750
what kind of a VPN and how it should

152
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:47,270
improve security this is the result of

153
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,810
the compound question it's okay if you

154
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,109
don't

155
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,680
cannot read everything I just wanted to

156
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,469
show show the differences the the left

157
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,180
battery is from the a group which

158
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:02,270
receives the original questions with a

159
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,930
compound question and the middle and the

160
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,789
right group is from the B group which

161
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,370
received separate questions for

162
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:15,259
effectiveness and realism so why you'll

163
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,389
see that effectiveness overall lines -

164
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:21,430
how good is the advice to the general

165
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:24,680
question we see lots of fluctuation

166
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,800
regarding realism for example we're

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,099
having unique passwords which is oh I

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,880
don't have a courtesy here which is the

169
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:39,529
topmost in the in the upper middle at

170
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,250
half where Rizla realism ratings were

171
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:45,980
rather low compared to high

172
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,579
effectiveness ratings and we're looking

173
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:53,209
further at these different scores we

174
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:56,870
could identify four fields of action

175
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:58,060
where effectiveness was rated high but

176
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,010
realism

177
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,619
that a user can follow it was rated

178
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,750
rather low so what we did was determine

179
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,370
the difference of the means the mean

180
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:11,560
ratings for effectiveness and realism

181
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:16,810
and we see that the most the largest

182
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:20,020
gaps are in the field of passwords which

183
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,119
is not very surprising Janique and

184
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,430
strong passwords are considered

185
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,410
effective but hard to follow and also

186
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,930
using password managers this is more

187
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,660
interesting because password managers

188
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,569
have been around for a bit but experts

189
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,910
still don't see them as fit for the

190
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,720
general population so there might be

191
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:43,140
some usability issues left there so if

192
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,080
you plan to work on password managers

193
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,960
this could be a good field for actual

194
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,160
improvements

195
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,600
another thing is two-factor

196
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,870
authentication which was also rated as

197
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,670
very effective for security but not very

198
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,170
realistic that people could follow it

199
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,760
this is again unclear

200
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,219
maybe the experts rated it like that

201
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,410
because two-factor authentication is not

202
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:16,530
available for each account for every

203
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:20,230
account but maybe they also thought that

204
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,390
setting it up and using it was a burden

205
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,690
too high for non expert users we don't

206
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,490
know this and I'm happy that there are

207
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,820
so many posters about two-factor

208
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,140
authentication research out there so

209
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,839
apparently people are working on it

210
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:39,040
which is a good sign other fields were

211
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,020
yeah and the fact and the field of

212
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,569
mindfulness as the original authors

213
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,819
called it being careful with links not

214
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,350
opening attachments and not entering

215
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,350
passwords after clicking on links and

216
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,620
emails these pieces of advice were also

217
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,200
rated effective but not very realistic

218
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:00,310
some expert participants added and free

219
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:03,160
text common fields that they're it's

220
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,890
basically part of their work that they

221
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,010
receive email from unknown people and

222
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,580
that they open attachments from them

223
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:15,819
because that's just how

224
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:19,190
how online work life works sometimes so

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,600
there's also this gap I'm not sure if if

226
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,580
this is an issue we can solve

227
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,899
technically but yeah it's up for grabs

228
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,140
and another thing was updating

229
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:35,620
applications you may be remember that in

230
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:37,880
the first figure in 2015 there were

231
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,769
application updates and system updates

232
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,470
however the system updates have

233
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:44,899
disappeared from our participants

234
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,320
priority list this might be because

235
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,760
Windows has rolled out automatic system

236
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,760
updates in the mean time that are not

237
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,010
disabled that I don't know if this would

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:00,470
work so this issue seemed to have been

239
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,980
turned down but application updates are

240
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,980
still a thing

241
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:10,100
Windows 10 has also tried to to tackle

242
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,800
this issue by introducing a Windows app

243
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,750
store which allows App Store like

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,020
centralized update infrastructure but

245
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:23,000
the adoption rates don't seem that high

246
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,850
okay although we can learn a lot there's

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,320
still some limitations on this work of

248
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,779
course their expert sample is not only

249
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,930
different in time but also in

250
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:36,230
recruitment and as such demographics

251
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,779
especially regarding location we thus

252
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,870
cannot say if the changes that we

253
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:44,060
observed are because times have changed

254
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:48,740
or because our population is now more

255
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:52,520
European I highly welcome any research

256
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:55,149
on cross culture or global expert

257
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,709
security expert participant groups and

258
00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:00,230
their different attitudes based on tech

259
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:03,790
culture because security practices are

260
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:07,310
obviously a very cultural coin thing

261
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,560
yeah so that's that we also look at the

262
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,149
buffer expert experiences because we

263
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:17,599
suffered from recruitment issues we also

264
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,829
try to contact other security blocks

265
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,640
besides the Google online security

266
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,870
blocks but we were turned down so yeah

267
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,310
we lowered the bar a bit but

268
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,470
as I already said we saw no difference

269
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,540
between one to five years of experience

270
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:35,550
and five or more years of experience and

271
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:40,140
of course the MTA population has likely

272
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:43,709
changed too and we don't know what else

273
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:49,140
contributes to that how much the

274
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:51,450
observed effects are a result of yeah

275
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,550
the changing technology landscape or the

276
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,380
changing Amtrak population and last but

277
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,900
not least all data is self-reported as

278
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,850
it was in the original study and we know

279
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,420
that people likely overestimate

280
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:06,540
themselves in such scenarios so to

281
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,819
summarize we replicated a study from

282
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,780
2015 on security practices and advice

283
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,950
and find found out that our findings

284
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,110
largely aligned with previous work

285
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,350
however we could identify new trends

286
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,840
like script and ad blocking software

287
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,180
that also potentially handles cookie

288
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,080
issues which were present in 2015 but

289
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,719
not in our replication we also improved

290
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,030
on the study design and therefore could

291
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,270
identify four key areas that still need

292
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:39,329
work from research and or practitioners

293
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:44,730
suffer up passwords two-factor

294
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:48,150
authentication updates and handling

295
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,730
links and attachments and yeah all these

296
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:54,000
topics were also present in the original

297
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:58,460
study which kind of shows that there

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,720
hasn't been that much change which is

299
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:08,220
maybe a bit bad because research has

300
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:13,080
advanced and practice not really I'm not

301
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,640
sure so if you work on these topics feel

302
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,980
free to look into that

303
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,930
feel free to prioritize your work on

304
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,980
password managers or 2fa and stuff like

305
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,989
that

306
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,360
so that's obviously where action is

307
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,090
needed thank you very much and also

308
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,040
thanks again to Julie Ryan Rob Reider

309
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,320
and sunny console for supporting us so

310
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,630
much with our replication efforts thank

311
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:40,840
you

312
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:40,840
[Applause]

313
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:50,750
hi I'm Rob Reider of yawn reader and can

314
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,100
solve it so I'll start by apologizing

315
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,630
for all the things we couldn't provide

316
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,520
for you for the replication but it's

317
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,380
super cool that you did the replication

318
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,360
and to see the things that change is

319
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,780
really cool to me I wonder what do you

320
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,340
think are the potential to have I know

321
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,390
how hard it was to do the original study

322
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,740
you know harder let's do this

323
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,010
replication do you think there's

324
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,230
potential to improve the efficacy of

325
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,450
running cranking through the methodology

326
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,680
so that this could be replicated on a

327
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,120
semi-regular basis by whomever is able

328
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,620
because I do I do we always thought

329
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,350
advice would be changing over time and

330
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,420
your results suggested it is even in

331
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,990
just four years what do you think is the

332
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:36,199
potential for that to happen I think

333
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,080
it's it's a good idea to to make this

334
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,580
more of a longitudinal thing and I could

335
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,590
say from my experience that the eMeter

336
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,170
study was pretty straightforward and

337
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:48,020
evaluation but expert recruitment was

338
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:51,349
very hard and very difficult so it would

339
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,079
be great yes to have a heaven MTurk for

340
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,300
security experts which we could draw

341
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,280
from but I know that it is not very

342
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:04,399
realistic so yeah I would appreciate

343
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,980
that and and I would be also happy to

344
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:12,170
contribute to that but yeah I see the

345
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,089
problem in expert recruitment hi I was

346
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,480
really interesting and Pilar from

347
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,639
1password and I was wondering if you

348
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,410
looked at all into what experts and

349
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,380
non-experts can say there is strong

350
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,709
passwords because I have a feeling that

351
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,370
the intersection is pretty slim in there

352
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:35,120
even if they think the same thing yeah

353
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,770
great question thank you so we were kind

354
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,629
of restricted to the original study and

355
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,200
our methodology but I know that there

356
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,210
were some free text comments on that I'm

357
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,360
not sure if any on passwords

358
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,070
specifically are in the paper but I can

359
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:53,379
look them up for you and sometime to

360
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:56,770
what do thank you hey doing Cosley from

361
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,990
Cornell and NSF again so I wanted to ask

362
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,300
about their realistic nice thing and

363
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,760
whether it's really I mean I'm down with

364
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,300
usability and all right but but do you

365
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,610
think people rated it as not realistic

366
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,460
because password managers and two-factor

367
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,629
authentication aren't usable or that

368
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,530
they didn't think that they could

369
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,690
convince people to do it right thanks

370
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:24,010
actually we don't know from the

371
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:27,490
methodology we use we also don't know

372
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,379
whether yeah whether the compound rating

373
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,060
how much it was influenced by realism

374
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,240
and how it was influenced by

375
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,510
effectiveness a combined rating of three

376
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,160
could be a five in effectiveness and one

377
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,980
in realism or the other way around or

378
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,770
both that three this is still thing that

379
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,450
we don't know there definitely needs to

380
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,600
be further research on why these things

381
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,160
aren't deemed as realistic so yeah

382
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,120
that's what I also highlighted and try

383
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,120
to motivate people to

384
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,170
