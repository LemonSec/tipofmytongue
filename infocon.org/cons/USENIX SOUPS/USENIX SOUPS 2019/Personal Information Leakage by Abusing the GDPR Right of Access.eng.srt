1
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,670
so indeed personal information leakage

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,920
by abusing the GDP our right of exits

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,029
without further ado let's get straight

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,369
into it because there are a lot of

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,529
things to talk about so the general data

6
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,480
protection regulation it's actually a

7
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:29,019
European framework that came into effect

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,159
since May 2018 and it's primarily meant

9
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,290
for European consumers and businesses

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:40,809
but it's although it's not dependent on

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:43,119
the citizenship of the consumer as like

12
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,070
because it came to effect I think it's

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,760
more than a year ago right now it

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,920
generated a lot of startups which they

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,379
think they can provide a

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,500
one-size-fits-all solution to be gdpr

17
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:59,830
compliance but as we will show you later

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,890
in the talk that's often not the case an

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:06,130
important thing of GDP are is that it

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,170
actually has a substantial monetary

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,600
penalties so in the worst case if

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,750
they're not GDP are compliant you may

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,679
pay up to 2 million euros or 4% of the

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,750
yearly turnover so part of that European

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,540
framework you have to use right of axis

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,700
now the right of axis is a specific

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,100
article and the GDP are that actually

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,260
permits you that actually permits

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,059
subjects to request all their personal

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,280
information from any given organization

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,980
so that means like let's say I would

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,340
like my data from Netflix so I say like

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,750
hey Netflix so I sent an email true just

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,300
by an email client and I say like hey

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,490
Netflix I would get to I would require

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,830
all my data and you have to provide it

37
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,050
to me for free and within a month with

38
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,039
its own exceptional case is three months

39
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,770
and you can use your data with any goal

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,049
to any purpose you want nor paper we

41
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,658
call this data request that previous

42
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:06,250
works also call it subjects access

43
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:07,270
requests so our resource questions what

44
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,908
we are going to do is we are actually

45
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,859
going to send data requests under the

46
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:13,810
right of axis so the first question we

47
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,519
have is what information is requested by

48
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,129
the organization to verify the identity

49
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,799
of the consumer so that means like let's

50
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:23,750
say I send an email to Netflix

51
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,940
requesting my data what are a what

52
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,340
of credentials are they going to ask me

53
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,340
to verify those really neither is asking

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,410
that data next how was it requested

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,660
information verified by the organization

56
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,520
so that means let's say they ask for an

57
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,010
ID card like how are they going to prove

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,630
that this ID car is real the next

59
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,730
question which is primarily the main

60
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,560
topic of the start today can I request

61
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,619
that information be forged by an

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,360
adversary or can the organization be

63
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,040
persuaded through social engineering to

64
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,950
obtain personal information from someone

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,900
else so let's say I would like to get

66
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,019
data of one of my friends or one of my

67
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,870
rivals can I actually get that data by

68
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,209
using data requests and finally as

69
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,989
you'll show later in the stock there are

70
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:10,700
a lot of problems with these gdpr

71
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:14,690
implementations so how can we improve

72
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,160
the identity verification now so how are

73
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,510
we going to answer these questions so

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,180
first of all we're going to impersonate

75
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,040
two targeted individuals as an adversary

76
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,620
in order to obtain their personal data

77
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,840
by falsifying or forging these data

78
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,730
requests so these two individuals are

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,739
actually two authors so that's my

80
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,619
colleague and me now what we did is we

81
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,690
contacted 55 organizations primarily

82
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,000
based on the Alex laptop 50 which is

83
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,829
just a list of websites based on

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,739
Internet traffic and we did that

85
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,540
independently of each other then as we

86
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,910
do not want to shame the organizations

87
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,760
that were vulnerable we are going to

88
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,519
classify each organization in categories

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,359
more specifically financial retail new

90
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,120
sets and so forth so what credentials

91
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,190
are really being asked or verified by

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,320
the organization so we contacted all

93
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,600
these organizations and they often

94
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,040
require combinations of the following

95
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,260
credentials so first of all you have to

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,298
login credentials so what does that mean

97
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,850
actually for example Google and Facebook

98
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,769
have a similar process where they just

99
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,079
require you to login on the platform

100
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,970
just with your regular username and

101
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,260
password and then you will have to click

102
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,210
a button and you'll get order data

103
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,880
within a couple of hours so that's the

104
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,159
usual I mean it's not the most common

105
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,040
way to do it but it's the suggested way

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,560
to do it next we have email address

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,349
ownership so that means that if they

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,529
allow you to ask your personal data by

109
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:39,149
email they will

110
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:43,019
just say like hey okay you can only send

111
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:44,339
an email and only send requests when an

112
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,279
image address that is known to us

113
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,959
beforehand so when you are signing up

114
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,089
for an account you usually have to

115
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,949
provide an email address so you can only

116
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,499
send a request with that specific email

117
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,259
address the next thing is actually the

118
00:04:55,499 --> 00:05:02,399
ID card so some companies think it's a

119
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,779
good idea to just ask for an ID card so

120
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,689
they can prove that it's really you'd

121
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:09,029
ask me the data next we have the home

122
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:12,479
address so some companies also think

123
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,459
that that's only the person that is

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,429
asking the data can know where you live

125
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,139
from which city loot that you live next

126
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:21,508
thing is Congress subject so that means

127
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,859
that they will call you to a number to a

128
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,769
phone number that is known to them

129
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:28,558
beforehand probably also to the sign up

130
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,959
page beforehand and that is often done

131
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:33,029
in combination by specific by asking for

132
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,099
specific user data so that means that

133
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,409
for example if you are contacting an

134
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:39,808
insurance company they might ask you for

135
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:43,529
an invoice number or your last product

136
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:45,629
that you have bought so now can we Forge

137
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,360
or falsify or maybe extract the

138
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:51,179
requested credentials so first of all in

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,429
our dress it's a very old concept

140
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:55,409
fishing it's like fishing 101 back in

141
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:56,998
the 90s you just create a similar

142
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,489
looking email dress than the original

143
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:02,219
one so let's say we have Mariano Dotson

144
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:05,459
matino at yahoo.com and let's say I make

145
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:08,129
I changed or at least I modified the I

146
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:11,489
wouldn't L so I think I'm not sure that

147
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,839
people quite for at at the end of the of

148
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:16,138
the room can really see the difference

149
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,179
so in our example is Mariano dot

150
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,429
DiMartino at gmail.com and we just

151
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:22,888
bought the domain name Gmail where the

152
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:25,229
eye is like an eyewitness maligned and

153
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,259
Frank is called an axon thank you so

154
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:31,859
that's really difficult to see in some

155
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,169
in your clients so the home address so

156
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,969
like I said before some organizations

157
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,269
ask you for the home address or the city

158
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:41,579
in which you live of course that is most

159
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,649
often public information that you can

160
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,199
find in social media you just google a

161
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:49,079
bit you can find it through all sorts of

162
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,810
open source intelligence and or what you

163
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,090
also can do is you can just what

164
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,530
the neighbor next to you and write down

165
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,549
the city in which he lives because it's

166
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,979
written on the name card obviously next

167
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,100
ID card so in theory we could actually

168
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,570
take a picture of our own ID and

169
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,490
Photoshop the name the date of birth and

170
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,400
the portrait photo of the individual and

171
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,100
we couldn't censor everything else so

172
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,630
most companies rarely require you to

173
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,910
provide your National Register number or

174
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,250
your passport ID number so you can just

175
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,169
answer it because it's possible in

176
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,419
theory but in practice that's also what

177
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,180
we did actually so we actually forged

178
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:32,750
the ID card well not for Photoshop I

179
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:35,419
should say the name is doe John so let's

180
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,180
say or individual is called doe John and

181
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:41,659
we saw I just took a picture i

182
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,550
photoshopped the name on and the date of

183
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,620
birth and then I also took a picture

184
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,669
from social media and I photoshopped it

185
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,530
on Eid I have to say so we censored the

186
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,070
card ID number although we did not

187
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,599
censor the eyes on the photo because we

188
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,750
didn't want to get victimized yourself

189
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,180
by Supes attendees so but at the

190
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,539
original request we actually did not

191
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,810
censor the eyes so now there are a

192
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,250
couple of I mean there are a couple of

193
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,050
credentials that they have asked but

194
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,419
sometimes they really ask good

195
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,390
credentials so things we cannot Forge or

196
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,549
or extract from somewhere so we have to

197
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,919
resort to other things for example by

198
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,440
using social engineering techniques one

199
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,299
example is some organizations say like

200
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,880
hey please send a request for an address

201
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,260
that is known to us beforehand so when

202
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,270
an adversary could say it's like yeah

203
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,919
sorry I lost access to my account due to

204
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,140
hackers there's a reason why I'm sending

205
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,490
his data requests just make up an excuse

206
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,830
so we had five organizations that

207
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,839
actually said a similar thing and only

208
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,339
worked on one of them although you might

209
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,959
think like hey that's only one out of

210
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,580
five but still like one company that

211
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:53,270
leaks your personal information is

212
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,070
already bad enough our organizations are

213
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,390
like hey we send your personal data to

214
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,030
an email address that is known to us so

215
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,699
that means that they actually verify to

216
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,110
identity but they're not quite sure so

217
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,279
they're just going to send the personal

218
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,259
data to an image

219
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,420
is known to them so what we did is we

220
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,339
just wait until a few days before a

221
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,378
deadline and then we said like hey we

222
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,029
did receive a response to the original

223
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:16,069
data request and the deadline is almost

224
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,810
past so you don't you don't want to be

225
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:20,149
too deep we are in compliance so please

226
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:24,258
send us the data it kind of worked in

227
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:26,629
one out of the two organizations next

228
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:29,660
the final one important one is please

229
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:35,059
send you proof a B and C to verify your

230
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:38,149
identity so in fact if they ask you for

231
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,769
three proofs in fact what we did as we

232
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,170
just wait under a few days and then we

233
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,269
said like okay is proof a and C and it

234
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,829
worked out of four two out of the two

235
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:48,499
companies so the Oval strategy here is

236
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:50,899
just a lot of treasure and a lot of

237
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:52,430
legal talk even though that often

238
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,999
doesn't make any sense at all what we're

239
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:59,029
saying so from 55 evidence or results

240
00:09:55,999 --> 00:10:01,519
sorry from 55 organizations there were

241
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,839
37 that accepted manual data requests so

242
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,379
that means that we could just send an

243
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,610
email and we could get a response to

244
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,589
that same you know 14 of them didn't 40

245
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,199
of them provide an online platform so

246
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,029
like I said they just require regular

247
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,709
username and password for example like

248
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,529
Facebook or Google or all the major

249
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:24,250
companies do and further than answer at

250
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:27,350
all so they're not allowed GPR compliant

251
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,720
now of these 37 organization there were

252
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,730
12 that actually leaked a personal data

253
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,420
of the individual so we could actually

254
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:38,059
leak so we actually got the data from 12

255
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,410
companies from the individual and the

256
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:40,910
falsified credentials were never

257
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,469
questioned there was sort of as no

258
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,240
company that actually said like hey that

259
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,730
ID looks fake no because it looks very

260
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,559
lightly so tree out of 30 several

261
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,069
organizations also leaked personal rate

262
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,439
of someone else so we asked the data of

263
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:56,689
individual a but we got actually data

264
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:58,610
from other persons that had similar

265
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,469
names or that something went wrong

266
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,970
it's a very interesting case here but I

267
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:07,519
hope I can say it if my time permits it

268
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,160
so the results the leaked data that we

269
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,720
actually got from these organizations

270
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,790
vary widely for example for the

271
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,709
financial we actually have time stand

272
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,480
financial transactions or account

273
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,829
numbers or

274
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,779
the services that we have bought at

275
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,519
insurance companies for example another

276
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,250
example is the serial numbers of

277
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,970
products delivery dates started funny

278
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,920
here because some companies ask you to

279
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,589
provide the serial numbers of the

280
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,120
products so that means that if we could

281
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,209
just get it from one company we could

282
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,750
just piggyback it and use that data to

283
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:42,459
falsify even more data requests

284
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,889
entertainments similar things profile

285
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:47,319
preferences products but for the

286
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,930
transport and logistics we even receive

287
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,029
timestamp GPS locations so we could know

288
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,489
where the adversary went where the

289
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:56,230
individual whence the safe routes the

290
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,620
purchase tickets the customer ID and so

291
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,500
forth

292
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,420
what the news outlets we actually even

293
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,410
received browsing history so which

294
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,019
device was the victim using which

295
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,709
operating system and also which profile

296
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:14,079
preferences so recommendations actually

297
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,239
I would like to point article to

298
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,550
emphasize that it's not the GDP ours

299
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,069
fault that these organizations have

300
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,959
barely implemented policies also

301
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,760
consumers can't really do much about it

302
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,310
they just have to do some kind of basic

303
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,449
hygiene for example just don't show all

304
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,339
the pictures for for public I mean I

305
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,889
mean I've said don't show all the

306
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,589
pictures for on social media if you're

307
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,720
not friends with the person for example

308
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:42,819
or just hide your date of birth I'm sure

309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,420
a lot of you really show the date of

310
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,260
birth on their social media account

311
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,779
organization so that's really the

312
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,949
problem here because the GDP are

313
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:55,510
actually it suggests you too weak to to

314
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:57,399
have a platform where you can log in

315
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,709
with your regular username and password

316
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,769
it also significantly reduces the risk

317
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,869
another thing we recommend is to

318
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,990
strictly verify the ownership of the

319
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:11,829
images so that means that even though

320
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,699
you have or an adversary has made a

321
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,489
similar-looking

322
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:18,459
in a dress you might still like check it

323
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,110
really lateral error just character per

324
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,209
character so that's really sure that

325
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,760
it's the same in a dress another thing

326
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:26,699
that we suggest is to call the subject

327
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,740
and forget specific user data so

328
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:32,349
anniversary usually does not have no

329
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,070
about the invoice number from a certain

330
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:39,370
from a certain victim another thing

331
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,280
please don't ask IDs like as we have

332
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:45,280
shown a couple of slides before we can

333
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,560
easily Photoshop them so please don't do

334
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,930
that

335
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,459
really quick the ethics so I have to say

336
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,500
this from my colleague who works at a

337
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,320
large part of households

338
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,990
we actually got written permission from

339
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,000
the target individual so don't worry

340
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,520
from the ethical Research Committee as

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,040
well all the vulnerable organizations

342
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,079
were notified of our research and our

343
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,780
recommendations of course in our paper

344
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,750
all the organizations are anonymous and

345
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,640
classified in different categories and

346
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,800
finally all the organizations responded

347
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,319
positively so three of them even

348
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,810
requested a meeting at university itself

349
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,740
to discuss the recommendations and we

350
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:29,020
were happy to receive them so use me a

351
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,550
couple of minutes so in interesting case

352
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,250
is where we actually got data from

353
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,459
someone else so let's say or targeted

354
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,390
individuals called Leigh Johnson and

355
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,550
receive the date of an another

356
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,980
individual who is called Leslie Jeong

357
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,829
and address and so no streets number 15

358
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,990
so it's probably some very bad SQL query

359
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,510
that was made and that made this light

360
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,100
Johnson actually so thank you very much

361
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,550
everyone I'm glad to answer your

362
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,550
questions

363
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,230
thank you and if folks to come to the

364
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:10,290
microphones on with questions there's

365
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:11,760
two in the middle hello all right my

366
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,319
name is Abraham from University of

367
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,420
Michigan thank you so much for your talk

368
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,850
I'm wondering if you noticed there were

369
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,949
any similarities between the companies

370
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,260
that like would leak the wrong data like

371
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,300
maybe in size or type or country or

372
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,269
anything like that so you mean like the

373
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,339
type of data that leaked no if there

374
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:31,440
were the type of company oh okay

375
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,399
so yeah that was actually very

376
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,279
interesting it's also written in the

377
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,130
paper there were I think we considered

378
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,019
five financial organizations and I think

379
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,490
three or four of them actually leaked

380
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:46,440
data to us while entertainment companies

381
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,410
barely late leaked the data so I think

382
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:54,240
that's a very weird result that you get

383
00:15:49,410 --> 00:16:01,589
there so at that time answers your

384
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:10,829
question I hope wait thank you really

385
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:14,820
interesting work you mentioned that some

386
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:16,859
of the targeted users that you send

387
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,450
information about the information got

388
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,370
leaked and you got it

389
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:25,649
put what kind of future methods or

390
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,500
research designs would you suggest to

391
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:32,279
the companies so that whenever the

392
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,050
information is given about somebody they

393
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,880
should be like an alternate way to for

394
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,520
them to know that okay their information

395
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,079
has been disclosed by the company if

396
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,649
they ever got to know about that the

397
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,270
data is lead okay so any there are some

398
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,300
recommendations I think is the one of

399
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:52,079
amber Welch that actually says that you

400
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,779
for example and there are methods you

401
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,969
can use for example if you request your

402
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,920
data or someone else request this your

403
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,769
data you can actually provide a

404
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,300
notification on the online platform and

405
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:06,390
say like hey someone has requested your

406
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,919
data you can either cancel it or just

407
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,900
continue it

408
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,870
there are a couple of recommendations

409
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,299
that I think still from ember Welch

410
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,089
recommend but I'm not sure quite which

411
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:21,929
one so but there are indeed a lot of

412
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:25,139
possibilities there to apply yeah thank

413
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:29,100
you hello this is Jonathan Sanger from

414
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,540
whom ooh you mentioned that you gave one

415
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,639
of the recommendations was for companies

416
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,340
to use their primary education system in

417
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,900
order to authenticate GDP exactly yeah I

418
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,480
noticed over there are several cases

419
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,669
where a company is not likely to have a

420
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,070
strong primary authentication news

421
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,960
organizations for example and in these

422
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,090
cases they might not even have it tied

423
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,830
to an email address and is strongly a

424
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,659
variegated fashion are there any

425
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,159
recommendations of best practices in a

426
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,960
situation like that that's a very good

427
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,030
question because we have thought about

428
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,400
it as well because like you said indeed

429
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,020
some news outlets do not have that

430
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,460
information they don't even have an

431
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,710
email address or something like that

432
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,809
that's very problematic to actually

433
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,630
verify you yourself so there are some

434
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:13,740
recommendations where you can sign

435
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,640
specific things like you can sign your

436
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:20,220
ID card so it can be falsified but still

437
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,160
it's very problematic to to verify their

438
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,700
I don't really have any good solution

439
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,179
for that

440
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,830
I think policymakers should look more

441
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,299
into depth with that so I'm sorry to

442
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:37,049
this may be a very similar questioner

443
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,150
and for organizations that did not have

444
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,040
I don't know how many of the companies

445
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,020
you tagged did not have any digital

446
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,600
identity those users that they didn't

447
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:49,110
have any online

448
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,928
so I don't know for the examples that

449
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,540
you quoted if any of these companies the

450
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:58,710
users that you are like creating the

451
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:03,000
false okay they did not have any digital

452
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:05,460
identity at all meaning within urine you

453
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,669
don't exist as an identity within that

454
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,110
particular company's systems I'm sure I

455
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:13,309
don't I don't quite understand your

456
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,290
question yes my question is for the

457
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:18,500
companies that you are targeting yes

458
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,690
with your examples did they actually

459
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,210
have a login system

460
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,620
you could log in to or and you did not

461
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,880
exist over there oh so you mean the

462
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:32,419
organizations that were vulnerable or oh

463
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:36,020
so no so actually the data that that got

464
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:39,230
leaked was never from an organization

465
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:43,370
that require regular login credentials

466
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:46,700
so we actually I think it was 14 I think

467
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,340
so obvious 14 we actually requested the

468
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,550
data but we didn't got any data from

469
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,220
someone else or other big data so okay

470
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,230
so there was nobody any online request

471
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,940
system this was all through calling them

472
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:04,670
or manually doing this so in the 37 that

473
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,160
were there so I've quickly back so the

474
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,710
37 actually accepted manual data

475
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,200
requests so they did not require any

476
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:17,600
again credential okay that times with

477
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:20,210
question okay thank you so hi my name is

478
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,399
Kevin from left I see your

479
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,890
recommendations was that organization

480
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,650
should use their existing authentication

481
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:33,050
mechanisms to keep access requests I

482
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:35,060
have you thought about at all the

483
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,440
challenge of minimizing the risk of

484
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,240
account takeovers so if we assume that

485
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,220
the account has already been taken over

486
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,890
then what can organisms do to minimize

487
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,130
the risk posed by the data in the data

488
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,170
subject access requests yeah so if I

489
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,390
understand correctly you mean that if

490
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,130
someone has to take has taken over your

491
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,070
account they can just easily request

492
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,950
your personal data right yeah so we

493
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,830
haven't really thought about that the

494
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,650
fact is even for like simple account

495
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,379
logins or indeed a lot of organizations

496
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:10,340
that provide two-factor authentication

497
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:14,660
so that may be required of course but I

498
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,970
don't I'm not quite sure if if that's I

499
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,860
mean you could I mean you could of

500
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:23,390
course apply two-factor authentication

501
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:26,300
but that means that the consumer has to

502
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,250
provide some way of of other

503
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,980
identification either through Google

504
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:33,550
Authenticator or as a meses or something

505
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:39,520
but yeah that will be a good idea yeah

506
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:40,570
thank you okay thank you I think we're

507
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,339
