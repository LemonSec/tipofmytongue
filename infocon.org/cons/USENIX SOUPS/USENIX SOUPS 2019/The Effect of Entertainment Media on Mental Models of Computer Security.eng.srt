1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,720
name is Kelsey Fulton and today I'm

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,209
going to talk about our research that

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,170
explores how entertainment media shapes

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:21,759
people's perceptions of cybersecurity so

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,710
to start we may ask ourselves you know

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,720
how do people make security relevant

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,760
decisions well as I'm sure you're all

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,320
very aware they are all from something

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,060
we call their mental models right

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,180
basically how they perceive and

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,370
understand computer security but prior

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,320
research has actually shown that

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,790
fictional media influences people's

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,650
mental models and I'm talking about

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:48,489
fictional media that looks a little

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:53,379
something like this guy right here no

17
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:54,449
way I'm getting hats or ports key no no

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,770
this is major

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,140
they've already burned her the NCIS

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,610
public firewall well isolate the note

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,290
and dump them on the other side of the

22
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,290
router I'm trying it's moving too fast

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,090
this is not good because our connection

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,980
with the intrastate abase separate yeah

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,080
it's a point attack he or she is only

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,670
going after my machine it's not possible

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,679
this deal d-level mine encryption it

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,270
would take months

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,710
where's that video game no corner you

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,780
are getting hacked they get in the heavy

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,669
computer the entire NCIS no work is next

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,410
I can't stop him do something the key

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,410
I've never seen code like this

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:46,250
ha will you go Abby I didn't do anything

35
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:47,510
I thought you did no I did as much as we

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,060
could sit here and watch YouTube clips

37
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,740
of NCIS all day we'll skip that part

38
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,690
alright so as I'm sure all of you are

39
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,949
aware that video is perfectly accurate

40
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,750
right so as if we can see you know these

41
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,720
depictions often span the spectrum of

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,460
accuracy some more accurate some like

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,979
NCIS not throwing any shade a little

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,049
less accurate and so if users are

45
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,520
watching this and learning from it this

46
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,730
could be extremely detrimental right and

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,670
so in order to understand maybe how this

48
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,290
media is affecting people we need to

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,429
understand you know exactly what are

50
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,620
they taking away from these kinds of

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,090
portrayals so in order to do this we

52
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,620
want to answer a question like you know

53
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,270
how our fictional TV shows and movies

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,709
informing people's perceptions of

55
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,540
computer security now that's a very

56
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,760
broad question so in order to do this

57
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,840
we'll break it down a little bit so

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,100
first we want to understand you know

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,190
what are people learning from these

60
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,690
portrayals and then following that we

61
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,040
want understand you know how are these

62
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,840
learned concepts actually affecting

63
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,549
people's overall mental models of

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,090
computer security and in result their

65
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,900
behaviors and then lastly why are they

66
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,470
learning these things in particular

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,720
right why some things over others so in

68
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,430
order to do this we completed

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,170
semi-structured interviews we had 19

70
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,810
participants and our interviews were

71
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,369
kind of broken into three sections the

72
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,630
first is the background section where we

73
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,880
kind of got a feel for what people knew

74
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,140
coming into this how they defined hacker

75
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,700
things like that and maybe their

76
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,010
personal experiences with being hacked

77
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,600
then the second section was clips

78
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,130
where we showed them six clips and ask

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,269
them some follow-up questions namely you

80
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,760
know what do you think happened in this

81
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,380
clip and things like what did you find

82
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,810
realistic why what did you find

83
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,970
unrealistic why and then lastly we

84
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,709
followed it with a broad questions of

85
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,600
like how do you think fictional media as

86
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,820
a whole does with realism related to

87
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,920
computer security no once we completed

88
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,890
these interviews we used open and AK

89
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,720
sealcoating to suss out some themes so

90
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,700
to start I'm going to go over you know

91
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,989
what are people learning and how these

92
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,079
learn concepts are affecting their

93
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,150
behavior so

94
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,380
I may be a being a bit presumptuous by

95
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,520
saying we'll look at what are people

96
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,960
learning and why they're learning these

97
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,450
things I guess a really good question to

98
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,850
start with would be are people learning

99
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,649
from fictional media and it turns out

100
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,930
that they indeed are we actually had

101
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,010
five participants who mentioned media

102
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,900
depictions without prompt so for example

103
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,489
we asked a participant you know when I

104
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,620
say the word hacker what do you think of

105
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,120
and their immediate response was well I

106
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,590
think of Matthew Broderick and more

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,080
games so for those of you who are trying

108
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,400
to profile hackers don't worry we did it

109
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,450
for you that's exactly what it looks

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,548
like three participants also directly

111
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,358
mentioned TVs and movies as a source for

112
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,690
where they're thinking they're learning

113
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,520
these things and interestingly enough we

114
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,010
actually had people who made references

115
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,650
to fictional media who actually thought

116
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,820
that the media was inaccurate overall so

117
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,890
for example we had a participant who

118
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,440
said you know I think that the media as

119
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,240
a whole portrays these things

120
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,160
inaccurately and then they later said

121
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,800
you know sometimes when they're watching

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,330
movies or TV they just really kind of

123
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,740
accept whatever's being thrown at them

124
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,359
this is the same person who said that

125
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,410
they thought it was inaccurate and yet

126
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,900
they're still accepting what's being

127
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,710
thrown at them so this can actually

128
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,030
suggest that you know people who claim

129
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,650
to know better are actually being

130
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,280
influenced by these in addition to

131
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,989
people who don't claim to know better so

132
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,179
our results actually suggest a kind of

133
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,340
you know feedback loop where people are

134
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,660
learning mental models of security

135
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,179
sometimes from a fictional media

136
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,800
sometimes from other places but these

137
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,750
models are getting reaffirmed when they

138
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,550
appear in other media later so what are

139
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,020
people learning from fictional media

140
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,870
well

141
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,979
the learning that hackers are only

142
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,160
targeting are there specific people or

143
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,450
important people attacks on Wednesday

144
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,630
situations are always going to be

145
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,530
obvious encryption is fragile and all

146
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:38,250
security measures are futile unplugging

147
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,719
the computer and other simple solutions

148
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,919
and suspicious emails can be dangerous

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,060
and I'm gonna break these all down a

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,260
little bit so let's start with only

151
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,530
hackers only target specific and

152
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,849
important entities so people often

153
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,890
thought you know hackers are only going

154
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,370
to interpret choose important targets

155
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,780
furgus

156
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,760
but we had a participant who mentioned

157
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,830
you know that they indeed weren't

158
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,240
important enough to be a target for a

159
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,240
hacker right because they don't have any

160
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,500
money and later they connected this so

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,990
I'm watching a clip when they said you

162
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,310
know they thought that something was

163
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,900
realistic that the things that they were

164
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,220
breaking in that clip were of high

165
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,969
security so as you imagine very

166
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,710
important targets right people are also

167
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,419
learning that hackers always target a

168
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,870
specific person or entity rather than

169
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,400
you know sending a phishing email right

170
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,050
and so this is exemplified by someone

171
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,010
who said you know a target is someone

172
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,680
that you might have a personal grudge

173
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,960
against and they later connect to this

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,729
when they said you know the fact that

175
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,590
one of the clips we showed they targeted

176
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,419
one person at the NSA to get in instead

177
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,409
of targeting all of the NSA to get in

178
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:42,669
that seemed realistic to them so what

179
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,320
are people really taking away from this

180
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,669
well they're learning that they don't

181
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,590
need to protect themselves because

182
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,900
they're not important or they're not

183
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,000
dating aren't specific enough for

184
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,560
someone to want to attack them so

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,940
they're thinking that they never need to

186
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,190
actually protect themselves against a

187
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,419
hacker

188
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,520
so people are also learning that attack

189
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:04,359
and unsafe attacks and unsafe situations

190
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,919
are obvious so oftentimes in fictional

191
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,660
TV shows and movies an attack is

192
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,760
portrayed as you know an attack an

193
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,349
active intrusion as we saw in NCIS

194
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,599
that's going to trigger anomalous

195
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:15,280
behavior right and sometimes these can

196
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,979
actually include deliberate signatures

197
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,460
from a hacker something along this line

198
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,200
here right and so this is actually from

199
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,900
a clip that we showed and a participant

200
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,610
said you know that that seemed realistic

201
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,109
to them because the imagery of being

202
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,610
hacked where all the screens flash and

203
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,050
stuff that's what they think hacking

204
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,190
looks like it doesn't look like anything

205
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,700
else that's it

206
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,750
and so why is this a problem well if

207
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,460
people are waiting for an obvious

208
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,020
indicator of a security problem

209
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,120
oftentimes as you guys know they're not

210
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,409
going to get one right and so they may

211
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,039
think that they're safe when indeed

212
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,900
they're not people are also learning

213
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,630
that encryption is fragile and all

214
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,820
security measures are futile so

215
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,380
oftentimes in TV shows and movies we can

216
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,630
see that encryption is quickly and

217
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,890
easily broken by sufficiently talented

218
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:05,620
attackers and so when asked what they

219
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,300
thought hackers what imitations hackers

220
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,689
have they said absolutely none our

221
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,529
participant

222
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:12,819
said that they later tied this to a clip

223
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:14,379
when they said you know in our day and

224
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,360
age it seemed realistic because in a

225
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,449
blink of eye you're done you're not

226
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,249
protected and so people are learning

227
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,719
that they shouldn't trust any security

228
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:25,329
measures because they're just going to

229
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:27,009
get hacked anyway and while you know if

230
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,809
a nation-state is after me sure no

231
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,389
matter what I do they are going to get

232
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:34,120
into my my information that's often not

233
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,680
an actual attack model for the everyday

234
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,620
person right and so people are thinking

235
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,909
they should never protect themselves

236
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,250
then they're not preventing the everyday

237
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,910
hacker from getting to know sensitive

238
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,470
data people also felt that unplugging

239
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,110
the computer and other simple solutions

240
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,740
were a way to solve a problem for

241
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,819
example as you all saw in the NCIS clip

242
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,680
they unplugged the computer at then to

243
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:59,259
solve the problem and a participant felt

244
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,959
that this was indeed realistic because

245
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:04,089
back when they had viruses I imagine in

246
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,149
the 90s first thing they do is unplug it

247
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:09,279
and see if it worked again right and

248
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,740
interestingly enough as you all laughed

249
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,839
not a single participant actually noted

250
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,689
the use of a single keyboard by two

251
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,189
people it's actively defend against

252
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,930
attack and like well that's not

253
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:21,819
particularly problematic if they want to

254
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,079
go home and try to have two people type

255
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:25,509
on the same keyboard it's not going to

256
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,920
cause a major problem if they're willing

257
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:29,559
to take representations like this at

258
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,569
face value it's going to be they're

259
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,040
really going to be able to unable to

260
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,529
recognize potentially harmful

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,329
information so basically they're

262
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:41,920
learning that simple solutions can solve

263
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:43,120
potentially serious problems lastly

264
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,860
people were also learning that

265
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,790
suspicious emails can be dangerous and

266
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,980
now you all may be sitting there

267
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,300
thinking well Kelsey that's good that's

268
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,689
what they should be learning and you're

269
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,939
right

270
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,860
not everything portrayed in media is

271
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,959
detrimental to people's mental models

272
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,550
many participants noted that the

273
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,378
phishing in black hat was realistic

274
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,569
which is actually portrayed in this

275
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:03,910
photo here so those of you who can't see

276
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:05,769
in the back it's a picture of a email

277
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,469
that has a downloadable attachment right

278
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:10,269
and so when asked what about this clip

279
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,040
in particular was realistic you know a

280
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:13,839
participant said you always hear about

281
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,699
viruses that you can attach to an email

282
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,920
and so you never open attachments unless

283
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,779
you know who sent it to you and so this

284
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,459
is great because people are learning

285
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,660
that suspicious emails can be dangerous

286
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,460
and this is a proof that we actually can

287
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,240
use fictional media to teach people

288
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,529
things that will benefit them so now

289
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,420
that we've kind of covered the what and

290
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,100
the how let's dive a little deeper into

291
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,000
the why people are picking these things

292
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,709
in particular so how do people have I

293
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,480
eight realism well we found that

294
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:43,510
participants often start with a default

295
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,450
assumption accurate inaccurate and not

296
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,670
surprisingly mixed right and then they

297
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,620
mediate this default assumption by using

298
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,149
their own technical knowledge maybe

299
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,260
things they learn from their work or

300
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,620
things that they've personally

301
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,730
experienced non-technical backgrounds

302
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,410
and maybe things they heard from other

303
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,100
people but things they had experienced

304
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,279
in their own the compliance within the

305
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,790
clip with existing folk models and

306
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,320
lastly the cinematic aspects of the clip

307
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,520
so to start let's kind of explore the

308
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,500
proxy of people using their own

309
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,260
technical knowledge to evaluate realism

310
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,839
so first we found that technical jargon

311
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,770
usually implies realism to somebody in a

312
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,709
clip so for example participants said

313
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,150
you know when they hear technical terms

314
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:30,339
so for example in a clip we showed it's

315
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,839
like a foreign language and since they

316
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,100
have no idea what that means that's got

317
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,350
to be realistic to them it sounds

318
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,640
technical so it's got to be real but

319
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,200
interestingly this actually wasn't

320
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,180
always the case

321
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,010
some participants actually felt that the

322
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,300
president of jargon meant that

323
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,560
somebody's trying to pull a bunch of

324
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,810
technical terms throw them into a

325
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,619
paragraph at an attempt to make it sound

326
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,209
more realistic than it actually was

327
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,130
we also found that participants felt

328
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,410
that if a scene depicted was maybe too

329
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,959
fast or too easy and implied that it

330
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,500
wasn't realistic so oftentimes you know

331
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,969
it's hacking or defending is portrayed

332
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,010
as something that's active and quick and

333
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,480
easy right and that's always seen as

334
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,800
unrealistic to participants or

335
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,680
oftentimes seen is unrealistic to

336
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,469
participants people also use their

337
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,270
non-technical background to evaluate

338
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,579
realism and basically this is like

339
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,930
information inner experiences that they

340
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,160
personally had that maybe wasn't

341
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,709
directly related to the technical

342
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,630
knowledge they knew or understand so

343
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,489
first we found that if it matches with a

344
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,650
negative personal experience it implies

345
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,060
realism so we can see this with a

346
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,699
participant who said that a clip was

347
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,569
realistic because they used a keylogger

348
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,610
in the clip and

349
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,230
step that had put a keylogger on her own

350
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,640
computer to see if she had Facebook so

351
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,700
that's how she knew it was possible and

352
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,650
that made it seem realistic to her we

353
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,000
also found that participants felt that

354
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,880
were the relatability of the scene

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,290
implied that it was realistic for

356
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,730
example if someone could see the scene

357
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,849
happening to themselves then the scene

358
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,260
was more realistic to them so for

359
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,580
example in the black hat clip someone

360
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,569
said you know I found this realistic

361
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,280
because they probably would have fallen

362
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:05,380
victim to it too so that made it seem

363
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,360
real to them people also use the

364
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,860
compliance within this clip of with

365
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,090
existing folk models to determine

366
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,860
whether this seemed that it was

367
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,450
realistic so first we actually found

368
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,780
that the motivation for hacking within

369
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,860
the clip influenced the realism

370
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,260
participants often thought that hackers

371
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,360
were motivated by their desire to show

372
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,430
off and so within a clip we had someone

373
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,230
who was they thought it was realistic

374
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,969
because the character seemed like she

375
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,870
was showing off and so you know you want

376
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,980
to show people what you're good at

377
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,950
because that made it seem really

378
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,990
realistic to them we also found that any

379
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,870
deviation from hacker stereotypes

380
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,760
implied a lack of realism so for those

381
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,910
of you who are unfamiliar with blackhat

382
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,730
the main character a hacker is indeed

383
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,530
played by the handsome Chris Hemsworth

384
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,000
and somebody said that that was

385
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,040
unrealistic because Chris Hemsworth is

386
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,550
just too darn good-looking to be a

387
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:59,219
hacker interestingly enough often times

388
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,180
when asked what they found realistic

389
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,310
participants would just say that you

390
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,630
know hacking happens it's a plausible

391
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,239
thing I hear about it it's something

392
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,130
that can happen and so just by depicting

393
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,060
hacking within a scene that made it seem

394
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,290
realistic to them

395
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:17,949
and lastly participants viewed repeated

396
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,780
tropes as a way to imply realism so we

397
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,150
showed two clips that had an idea of

398
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,310
siphoning money for one clip that had an

399
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,020
idea of siphoning money for the reason

400
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,130
that somebody did it and somebody felt

401
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,850
that that was realistic because they had

402
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,520
seen it in another plot before people

403
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,110
also use cinematic aspects within a clip

404
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,840
to determine whether the clip team

405
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,910
realistic to them so first we found that

406
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,410
visual and audio cues affect realism not

407
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,510
surprisingly and participants were

408
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,819
actually often split on whether things

409
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,660
like Hollywood hacking indicated realism

410
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,660
or a lack thereof

411
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,830
character behavior also had an effect on

412
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,960
realism so for example as you guys saw

413
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,820
in the NCIS clip one of the main

414
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,800
characters was eating a sandwich it was

415
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,450
very laxity Zirkle about the fact that

416
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,099
they were being attacked and a

417
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,270
participant said you know that was just

418
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,190
too casual it didn't seem realistic

419
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,990
because the guy was the sandwich and

420
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,940
joined some lunch saying what's going on

421
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,960
and so to them that implied that it

422
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,590
wasn't realistic he should have been

423
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,650
taking it more seriously we also found

424
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,600
that incongruity reduces realism and so

425
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,160
what I mean by that is participants if

426
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,470
they perceive something in a scene as

427
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,600
being random or it seemed at a place to

428
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,950
them that implied a lack of realism so

429
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,070
with all this information in mind we

430
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,720
make some recommendations so there's a

431
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,340
need for collaboration which is easy to

432
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,590
say but we actually aren't the first

433
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,940
field to look at how entertainment media

434
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,070
affects people's understanding and

435
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,900
knowledge the medical field actually did

436
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,720
this that was the inspiration partially

437
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,189
for this project and so with medical

438
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,660
field was looking at whether if you

439
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,130
showed positive and accurate

440
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,380
representations within the media if it

441
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,900
would influence people and teach them

442
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,910
correct things it turns out it did and

443
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,300
so now there's a position in Hollywood

444
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,579
to advise TV shows and movies on the

445
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,300
information that they're handing out so

446
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,220
why can't we do that Hollywood also

447
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,750
needs to entertain responsibly that's

448
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,540
easier said than done and I understand

449
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,030
that but now that we kind of know what

450
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,180
people see as realistic and unrealistic

451
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,500
with entertainment value involved they

452
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,229
could potentially queue for seriousness

453
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,760
you know the whole to keyboard to people

454
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,070
on one keyboard thing not that

455
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,140
detrimental but we can maybe queue for

456
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,250
information and that could actually be

457
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,130
detrimental to let people know you know

458
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,820
don't take this seriously or do take

459
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,720
this seriously

460
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,010
and lastly educators can actually use

461
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,960
tropes and entertainment to their

462
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,580
advantage so it's easy to stand here and

463
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,190
say you know make more entertaining

464
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,470
educational material but it's not

465
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,200
necessarily that if we know what people

466
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,880
assume like if we know that for example

467
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,700
you can't have someone good looking be a

468
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,380
hacker we can use these kind of tropes

469
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,360
to our advantage right so if I can take

470
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,590
maybe a not so negative trope but use it

471
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,230
to teach somebody about something more

472
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,250
important

473
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,500
then we can benefit from that so to wrap

474
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,569
up our results suggest a kind of

475
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,130
feedback loop where mental models may be

476
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,290
created by media maybe you're not or

477
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,900
reinforced when they're later seen in

478
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,220
media when people are indeed learning a

479
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,630
variety of things from fictional media

480
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,290
but the good news is it's not all bad

481
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,790
things people often start with a default

482
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,010
assumption and then they use technical

483
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,730
personal and cinematic proxies to then

484
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,230
mediate this default assumption and

485
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,240
lastly we could potentially form a

486
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,850
cybersecurity task force make pretty

487
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,470
cool t-shirts right to help Hollywood

488
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,939
produce more accurate media that is at

489
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,550
least still entertaining to the general

490
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,640
population and with that I will take any

491
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,639
questions

492
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:51,630
[Applause]

493
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:57,658
my gosh Andrews my other field is media

494
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,559
literacy as it happens which is similar

495
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:02,809
one there one of the things that we look

496
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,750
to when we think about cinematic

497
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:08,700
influence is often sort of structural

498
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,519
things like camera angle speed of cuts

499
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,629
music things like that you're seeing a

500
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,279
lot of this here you're seeing the fast

501
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:16,379
cuts you're seeing far angles close

502
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,940
angles did anybody refer to any of those

503
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:21,389
or is that sort of beyond their

504
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,070
awareness yeah so great question they

505
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,449
actually didn't refer to like camera

506
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,059
cuts or anything but we did have people

507
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,620
mention like dramatic music which you

508
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,330
usually use to escalate a scene right

509
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,139
people often perceive that as being

510
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,449
unrealistic

511
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:34,649
I guess because when you get a virus on

512
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,299
your computer at home like there's not

513
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:39,120
some pop in like background music

514
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,370
playing right but people often stated

515
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,719
that the escalation of music to go along

516
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,469
with the plot seemed unrealistic to them

517
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,629
yes I'm Bucky from the University of

518
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,299
British Columbia this was very

519
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:53,399
interesting to watch I was just

520
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,820
wondering how did you avoid priming

521
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:59,129
participants was it like and maybe the

522
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,950
title of your equipment Nazis or because

523
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:03,299
I for my understanding they made points

524
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,519
after watching the clips and all of that

525
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,750
so how did you avoid priming them in

526
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,590
terms of your responses

527
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,820
sure yeah so when we recruited we were

528
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,529
advertised it as a computer and Internet

529
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,168
study which is about as big as you can

530
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:18,809
go and the IRB will still approve it and

531
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,460
so we didn't really ask them explicitly

532
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,350
about security experience coming in we

533
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,019
did ask them like how much time do you

534
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,668
spend on each medium like podcasts TV

535
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,240
movies to make sure we had a diversity

536
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:31,830
and hours that they spend watching media

537
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,539
and then we just kind of broadly started

538
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,879
asking them questions about hackers or

539
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,019
personal experiences and by the time we

540
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:38,219
got about halfway through the clips I

541
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:39,720
guess they started to pick up on that we

542
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,159
were looking for realism or lack thereof

543
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,240
but we were emphasized a lot of the time

544
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,190
too that there were no right or wrong

545
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,289
answers we were generally interested in

546
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:51,870
what they had to say and so that's that

547
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:54,149
was basically the approach we took hi my

548
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,789
name is Connor from Berkeley great talk

549
00:19:54,149 --> 00:20:00,770
thanks a lot do you have any plans to

550
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,420
look into the effect of journalism media

551
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,639
people's understanding of cybersecurity

552
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,340
practices where if they read something

553
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,580
in a newspaper they expect it to be true

554
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,980
but if it's inaccurate then it's giving

555
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,500
them a false sense of security I'm a

556
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,120
great question this is actually

557
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,670
completely unrelated to my dissertation

558
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,639
interests this was a project I did that

559
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,490
was a lot of fun to do but and so there

560
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,080
was no immediate plans so look into two

561
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,850
other mediums but something we did

562
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,230
discuss was a major limitation of our

563
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,699
work as we just looked at TV shows and

564
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,230
we just looked at movies what about

565
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,670
books what about podcasts what about

566
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,800
journalism right

567
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,850
what about regular news on TV how are

568
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,080
all these same flow and things

569
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,580
influencing it and it's definitely a

570
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,020
good place for future work that we just

571
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,020
don't have plans right now to explore

572
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,270
