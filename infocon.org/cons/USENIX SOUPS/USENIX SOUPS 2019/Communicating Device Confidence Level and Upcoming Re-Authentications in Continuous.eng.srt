1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,040
thank you very much hello everybody my

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,410
name is Sarah Durga Rodriguez and I'm a

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,060
master student at the new Munich and

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,040
today I would like to present our paper

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,380
called communicating device confidence

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,480
level and upcoming Rio 10th occasions

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,698
and continuous authentication systems on

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,609
mobile devices which is based on the

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,739
findings of my bachelor thesis so

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,780
imagine you leave your unlocked phone in

11
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,050
a public space for example a coffee shop

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,850
or your workspace some what could pick

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,760
up this phone and steal sensitive data

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,979
furniture but if you devise new uses

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,320
continuous authentication it would

16
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,960
recognize this intrusion and it could

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,260
restrict access to the attacker in a few

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,510
seconds this would be great wouldn't it

19
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,940
so now imagine this same great

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,159
continuous authentication system does

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,349
falsely detect you as an intruder to

22
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,720
your own device so it could restrict

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,750
your access to your own phone mid task

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,090
and trigger Rio 10th occasion wouldn't

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,010
that annoy you well you see there's an

26
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,410
obvious trade-off between usability and

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,120
security in this topic that's why we

28
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,550
aimed at reducing the annoyance caused

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,860
Pirrie authentication interrupts in with

30
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:27,530
our investigation so coming back to our

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,180
here presented publication you might

32
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,230
have noticed that our title contains

33
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,000
very much information so I use it as a

34
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,370
guideline furniture using the topic of

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,780
our research to you therefore I would

36
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,760
like to start with a brief introduction

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,270
of the current authentication on mobile

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,070
devices so currently authentication on

39
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,899
the smartphone consists in an explicit

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,470
authentication at the beginning of each

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,220
usage session which is normally based on

42
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,060
secret

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,460
tokens or biometrics but this method has

44
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,670
shown to have some challenges because it

45
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,750
firstly causes an overhead of

46
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,330
authentications because most usage

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,610
sessions don't include an access to

48
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,728
sensitive data and it secondly also

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,769
provides security provided in limited

50
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,200
security because there's no further

51
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,900
security mechanism after unlocking the

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,060
phone so this is where continuous

53
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,459
authentication comes in which is a much

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,300
investigative approach with the ability

55
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,410
to reduce the ultra indication Oh

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,630
ahead and increase the provided security

57
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,470
they there are two basic approaches and

58
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,579
continuous authentication creation which

59
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,920
contacts the we're in behavioral

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,690
biometrics please note here that it I

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,579
will use the terms implicit

62
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,730
authentication and continuous and

63
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,710
authentication interchangeably so the

64
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,739
first approach the context that were

65
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,750
implicit authentication and is where the

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,510
device continuously detects the current

67
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,520
usage context and it activates a

68
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,429
different unlocking methods depending on

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,940
the context so if a context is insecure

70
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,160
it will choose a more secure

71
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,079
authentication method the second

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,470
approach behavioral biometric implicit

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,050
authentication is where the system

74
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,120
continuously compares the current usage

75
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,690
with with the device owners behavior

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,580
pattern so based on this compulsion the

77
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,010
so called device confidence level is

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,960
calculated if the device confidence

79
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,980
level falls below the authentication

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:33,690
result the implicit authentication

81
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:37,980
failed so both approaches might need an

82
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:41,670
explicit real indication so the

83
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,560
simplicity that the simplicity Auto

84
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,429
indication really reduce the number of

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,459
explicit ones well this depends on the

86
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,860
use case if implicit authentication is

87
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,230
used perform on no authentication users

88
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,230
as a sole method of antek authentication

89
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,280
then the user has to don't do only a few

90
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,488
real indications

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,320
if the implicit system fails but if it

92
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,840
is used by former explicit

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,600
authentication users as a second barrier

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,100
of the security then some additional

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,930
real tenth occasions will be triggered

96
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,339
so it will increase the number of

97
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,380
explicit authentications but what is the

98
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,958
extent of second of this energy increase

99
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,300
provided by implicit authentication this

100
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,780
depends on the behavior of the system if

101
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,880
an implicit authentication fails so

102
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,530
normally if this happens an explicit

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,229
real indication will be triggered as a

104
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,750
fallback method most system designs like

105
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:37,740
for example Android smart lock don't

106
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,440
trigger an immediate

107
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,930
indication but the lair to the beginning

108
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,940
of the next next usage session so it

109
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,370
provides only a minor security increase

110
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,460
compared to explicit authentication at

111
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,080
the beginning of each user chat session

112
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,799
to avoid this other researchers have

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,150
suggested an immediate real indication

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,750
which could interrupt the use of mid

115
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,239
tasks

116
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,820
it therefore awaits further access of an

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,000
attacker in course and a major security

118
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,070
increase so this is why we chose the

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,320
immediate real indication is a topic for

120
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,310
further investigation but if an implicit

121
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,849
authentication system fails at

122
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,350
identifying an authorized user then this

123
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,950
interruption will cause obvious

124
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,320
usability issues researchers have found

125
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,900
three main usability issues of

126
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,270
implicitly medication the first one is

127
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,120
the missing possibility to influence the

128
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,030
timing of any authentication the second

129
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,710
one is the unpredictability of

130
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,270
interruptions and the third one is the

131
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,190
sensation of not being correctly

132
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,359
informed about the current state of the

133
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:48,900
system all these three issues caused

134
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,700
annoyance of users so we therefore

135
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,310
developed a concept which aims at

136
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,780
reducing this cost annoyance based on a

137
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,780
focus group discussion with five

138
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,880
participants this concept includes first

139
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,640
the possibility of Ria's indicating

140
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,610
voluntarily at any time to avoid fast

141
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,590
interruptions second the shot a

142
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,020
shortened announcement of an imminent

143
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,599
Ria's indication including in grace

144
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,909
period which allows the user to finish

145
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,920
the task and third the long term

146
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,930
indication of the current system status

147
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,560
which shows that the system is running

148
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,200
correctly so after introducing this

149
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,640
topic the last part of our title is now

150
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,010
covered and I would like to further

151
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,360
specify the research we conducted based

152
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:36,690
on it we derived four major research

153
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,610
questions based on this topic first one

154
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,250
is can indicators reduce annoyance

155
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,820
caused by unpredictable Ria's indicating

156
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,040
new requests second one are the other

157
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,159
factors influencing this annoyance for

158
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,150
example education of the user or the

159
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,340
interrupted tasks in cell

160
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,659
or the importance incidents and the

161
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,609
sensitivity of the task in third to

162
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,710
indicate as much users to reoffend acade

163
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,580
Volant airily and therefore avoid forced

164
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,320
interruptions and fourth how the users

165
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,099
perceive and respond to the introduction

166
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,270
of voluntary Rio 10th occasion we

167
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,730
therefore developed a prototype

168
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,940
elevating evaluating these research

169
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,670
questions our prototype was called

170
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,830
Authenticator and it is basically an

171
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,690
Android app which which simulates a

172
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,669
behavior biometric in place and

173
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,670
authentication system on touch glasses

174
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,890
so it reacts to touch interactions by

175
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,890
modifying the device confidence level by

176
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,870
chance if this device confidence level

177
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,409
falls below the authentication with

178
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,390
result in our case 20% a recent occasion

179
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,680
is triggered which will happen by

180
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:48,810
locking the screen so our prototype also

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,360
included some in-situ experience

182
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,480
sampling screens on the interrupted

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,250
tasks on the important and Svensson

184
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,260
tivity of the interrupted tasks and

185
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,580
annoyance caused by the interruptions

186
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,990
and the current location of the user

187
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,000
these screens were triggered after an

188
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,110
reopened occasion but maximum three

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,210
times per day based on our concept with

190
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,730
implemented for experimental conditions

191
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,830
in this prototype the first condition is

192
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,630
the no indicator condition which is the

193
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,450
first baseline of evaluation and

194
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,130
includes no indication the second one is

195
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,960
a short-term indicator condition which

196
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,420
unknown system imminent reoffend

197
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,580
occasion and it is our second baseline

198
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,560
based on the best condition of a

199
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,780
research conducted by Agra Valley at all

200
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,880
and it is a Supes paper from 2016 next

201
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,370
one is the long-term indicator condition

202
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,550
which visualizes the device confidence

203
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,860
level at any time and the last one is

204
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,439
the combination of both indicators so

205
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,460
short and long-term indicator combined

206
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,430
but how exactly did we implement this

207
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,230
current conditions so the first one and

208
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,660
no indicator condition includes no

209
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,340
announcement of real indications and no

210
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,510
indication of the device confidence

211
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,700
level as a system status

212
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,340
only has a basic notification with a

213
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,110
neutral system in the status bar so it's

214
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,630
basically perceived as a sudden locking

215
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,950
of the screen

216
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,680
the second condition is a shorter

217
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,140
indicator which if there is no imminent

218
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,979
REO sent occation is exactly the same

219
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,230
than the no indicator condition but if

220
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,240
there is an REO syndication triggered

221
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,280
the internet notification will pop up

222
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,070
which contains the current device

223
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:36,220
confidence level and a shortcut enable

224
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,750
immediate voluntary authentication the

225
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,420
screen will also start to dim out

226
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,100
gradually providing an 8 second grace

227
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,510
period for the user to finish the task

228
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,450
as you can see here after this grace

229
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,100
period the screen will be locked and an

230
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,490
explicit realtor indication will be

231
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,440
necessary the third condition is a

232
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,540
long-term indicator which indicates the

233
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,840
current device confidence level through

234
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,880
a shared symbol in the status bar it

235
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,860
contains a notification which is the

236
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,240
same as a short-term indicator condition

237
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,180
the fourth and last condition is a

238
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,800
combination of posts so it has first the

239
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,770
indication of the device confidence

240
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,319
level at any time and second it

241
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,760
announces an immediate Numan entry

242
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
authentication by the pop-up

243
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,110
notification and greatly delimit

244
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,900
gradually dimming out the screen as you

245
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,450
can again see here and again the screen

246
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,640
will be locked after this grace period

247
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,250
so an explicit real identification will

248
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,870
be necessary

249
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,980
we are villa waited then this prototype

250
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,740
through a new study which was within

251
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,930
subject field study with 32 participants

252
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,720
as before mentioned the dependent

253
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,430
variable of our research was the type of

254
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,070
indicator so we had the four conditions

255
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,689
which included the days by the two

256
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,410
baselines I mentioned before the no

257
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,470
indicator and a shot in Tim indicator so

258
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,640
this is the timeline of our field study

259
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,830
after installing the app the

260
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,140
participants tested each condition for

261
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:11,080
one week so we had a total duration of

262
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,810
four weeks the participants had to also

263
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,630
fill in an online survey at the end of

264
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,640
each condition an additional online

265
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,630
survey

266
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,350
start of the field study was used to

267
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,780
determine their demographics and the

268
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,150
final survey was also used to compare

269
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,430
all indicators and evaluate the implicit

270
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,079
or to indication in general the other

271
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,099
was counterbalanced by playing in

272
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,110
legends were so during the user study we

273
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,360
looked collected both quantitative and

274
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,090
qualitative data for example on the

275
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,550
device usage such as the unlocks the

276
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,310
touches on the screen the executed EPS

277
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,709
or on the recent occasions whether there

278
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,949
were voluntary or not which was an

279
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:58,020
interrupted app we also get at the

280
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,750
before-mentioned experience sampling

281
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:04,370
responses and the online questionnaires

282
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,320
and sent some optional final interviews

283
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,080
so we were a user study we were able to

284
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,670
gain some interesting insights first of

285
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,410
all I would like to briefly comment on

286
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,319
the participants perception of our

287
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,660
indicators when asked about the personal

288
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
preference most participants preferred

289
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,670
our indicators over having no indication

290
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,010
the exact same ranking was the

291
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,069
combination of most indicators first on

292
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,380
second place the long-term indicator on

293
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,430
third place the short-term indicator and

294
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,280
last no indication so users felt that is

295
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,500
particularly motivated to Rio tentacle

296
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,550
voluntarily by the combination of both

297
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,340
indicators to the topic that motivated

298
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,280
our orissa was an annoyance but we did

299
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,010
not found any significant effects of oil

300
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,839
indicators on the annoyance however we

301
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,670
did find significant correlations

302
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,100
between the importance of the

303
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,740
interrupted tasks in the noise caused by

304
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,720
the interruption and the sensitivity you

305
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,470
have to interrupt the task and again the

306
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,940
noise as can be seen in this graphic

307
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:13,830
over here annoyance was also strongly

308
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,220
influenced by the interrupted tasks

309
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,830
itself so as can be seen here the task

310
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,200
group noting voluntary which reported

311
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,510
that the user was doing like nothing

312
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,160
important in this moment was perceived

313
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,890
as a significantly less annoying

314
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,140
interruption than all other tasks

315
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,959
next I would like to discuss voluntary

316
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,060
authentication in general because it was

317
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,979
perceived not less annoying in the

318
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,930
experience and links but it was

319
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,320
mentioned by participants as a positive

320
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,089
feature it was also often reused one

321
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,010
third of our ríos indications were

322
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:53,350
voluntary voluntary real education was

323
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,959
also positively impacted by all our

324
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,910
indicators because they increase the

325
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:02,339
number of voluntary us indications

326
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,339
compared to the no indicator condition

327
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,510
now the final implications of our work

328
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,670
in summary we derived three main design

329
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,899
recommendations regarding the scheduling

330
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:19,209
of recent occasions the first one is

331
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,640
considering sensitivity of the task so

332
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,739
if accessing non sensitive data for

333
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,050
example while reading a reoffend

334
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,529
occasion could be delayed or triggered

335
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,260
when the task is finished but while

336
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,820
accessing sensitive data for example a

337
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,130
banking app and immediately

338
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,500
authentication should research directly

339
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:42,910
restrict further access to avoid

340
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:45,370
unauthorized access second curtains

341
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,569
consider also the importance of the task

342
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,670
as we found that the interruption of

343
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,459
important tasks particularly was

344
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:57,010
particularly perceived as annoying by

345
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,930
our participants so selectively delaying

346
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,019
such interruptions could improve the

347
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,449
users experience with the system the

348
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,670
search in Mac design recommendation is

349
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:08,620
that you could use the recent changes in

350
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,500
the device confidence level as a kind of

351
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,779
indicator because a sudden decrease in

352
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,850
the device confidence level most likely

353
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,610
corresponds to an intruder who taken

354
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,220
hold of the device but this one is a

355
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:25,060
spec of derivative assumption so further

356
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,740
research is necessary to prove it to

357
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,229
finish my task I would like to briefly

358
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,120
summarize our research so we

359
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,610
investigated the impact of a long-term

360
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,620
indication of the device confidence

361
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,959
level a short-term announcement of

362
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,600
imminent REO 10th occasion and the

363
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,020
possibility of Rio gente que turn

364
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,520
voluntarily on users perception of

365
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,470
authentication we found that all three

366
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,230
indicators were preferred to no

367
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,020
indication the Noi ins is influenced by

368
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,240
first the sensitivity second importance

369
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,689
and third that interrupts the task

370
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,520
itself we also found a positive effect

371
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:06,420
of all our indicators on the use of

372
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,910
voluntary of indications and finally we

373
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,829
also found that voluntary authentication

374
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,310
was perceived as a positive feature and

375
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,660
used to considerable extent so at this

376
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,939
point I would like to finish my

377
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,500
presentation thank you very much for

378
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:29,730
your attention and I would be happy to

379
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:32,610
answer your questions hi I'm Gus Andrews

380
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,160
I thank you this is a really novel topic

381
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,930
and I appreciate it I'm wondering and

382
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,069
this may be out of the scope of this

383
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,959
immediate analysis did you do a thought

384
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,300
exercise or a run-through of what would

385
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,430
happen of how this would perform in the

386
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,219
hands of an attacker because it seems to

387
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,160
me like a notification like hey you need

388
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,200
to really will would spur an attacker

389
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,969
who has the phone to do their tasks

390
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,750
faster and so they don't have to do that

391
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,980
yeah this is actually a topic we

392
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,470
recommended for further research too in

393
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,240
our paper because yeah if you see for

394
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,829
example the development of the device

395
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,890
confidence level it could be used as a

396
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:14,010
cue maybe but yeah we try to avoid this

397
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,650
a little bit by using the symbol only

398
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,379
it's certains fuel ever so you don't see

399
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:26,970
an immediate change but only like a 20%

400
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:29,700
soon change Jim Fenton thank you for for

401
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,550
this talk RIA 10 occation is one of

402
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,980
those areas where security is seen to be

403
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,440
diametrically opposed to usability and

404
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,150
we get a lot of pushback when we try and

405
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,470
impose these requirements and try and

406
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,620
figure out how to do it as gently as

407
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,679
possible one of the things especially on

408
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,309
mobile device is that

409
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,289
get questions about is whether the the

410
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,559
lock screen of the device should be

411
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:56,529
considered another e authentication for

412
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,960
an application running on that device

413
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:02,000
one of the difficulties in doing that is

414
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,020
that the application usually doesn't

415
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,970
have access as far as I know to the

416
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,580
information about what the lock screen

417
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,320
requirements were you know does does the

418
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,600
screen actually lock up unless it's a

419
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,070
managed device in which case that that's

420
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,980
controlled have you done any looking

421
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,879
into or been thinking at all about how

422
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,890
to aggregate reoffending together

423
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,350
between applications on the same device

424
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:34,850
in order to avoid having users have to

425
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,309
reallocate in several places when

426
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:41,029
they're multitasking and so you're

427
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:45,020
referring to an a based approach like

428
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:47,299
Rio sent ocation for each app in

429
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,149
individual apps that are running on the

430
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,379
device would probably need to prompt

431
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:53,600
themselves because they don't have

432
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,850
information about the other things that

433
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,039
are running or what's been happening at

434
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,199
the device level yeah where we

435
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:04,039
investigated more like a system-wide

436
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:07,419
system so not for app based approaches

437
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:15,799
but yeah I can take a look at it and

438
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:18,380
yeah thank you so some mobile systems

439
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:21,200
have explicit authentication barriers

440
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,549
when accessing sensitive data I'm most

441
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,830
familiar with iOS which has local

442
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:27,649
authentication and user presence

443
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,168
protected keychain items how do you feel

444
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:32,750
about that sort of more ambient level of

445
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:37,700
authentication versus this kind of more

446
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:40,429
explicit model well I do think that for

447
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,130
some apps like for example a banking app

448
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:46,039
it will always be a very important to

449
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,440
have maybe a second barrier but I do

450
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,919
think that implicit authentication would

451
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,679
be like a more fluid approach fact for

452
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,330
example for persons to avoid real

453
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,670
authentic Asians at the at the beginning

454
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,580
because we also

455
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,310
in the related work that like 40% of all

456
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,020
persons don't use any authentication so

457
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,540
maybe for this person's an implicit

458
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,690
authentication is like the the best

459
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:15,860
approach but if you want like the most

460
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,500
secure approach and edit like app based

461
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:23,600
the authentication will always be yeah

462
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:25,880
more secure so are you suggesting that

463
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,980
we have in addition to sort of device

464
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,940
authentication a separate mechanism with

465
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,840
separate secrets

466
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,060
because like again at least again on iOS

467
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,040
the the user presence test is basically

468
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,080
the same test that you do to unlock your

469
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,909
device so it's the same secret and

470
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,120
therefore the same bar for

471
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:47,150
authentication so banking apps can

472
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,489
request touch ID face ID or a specific

473
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,330
passcode do you feel that that should be

474
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,220
separated somehow yeah I do think that

475
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,580
this second parry of authentication

476
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,960
should be like using another

477
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,810
authentication method normally we didn't

478
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,110
do this because we had to lock the

479
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:08,540
screen because we didn't want to like em

480
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,219
root the devices of our participants so

481
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,250
we used the lock screen but we would

482
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,870
recommend use another for example and

483
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,910
stronger pin for this implicit

484
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,879
authentication or the recent occasions

485
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:25,460
in general so it's would be two

486
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:27,290
different pins like sample okay and I

487
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,480
will conclude with one last question I'm

488
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,520
interested since you showed users those

489
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,320
percentage scores the confidence scores

490
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,180
do you think one of the reasons that

491
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,679
there was a lot of reification was

492
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,390
because people saw that score and they

493
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,980
were like oh I really want to convince

494
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,470
my phone that it's me I want it to be

495
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,820
higher and and so I'm wondering if you

496
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,230
got any feedback or heard anything from

497
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,030
participants that said they were really

498
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,740
like paying attention to that number and

499
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,090
wanted to prove to their phone and to

500
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,630
your experiment that it was really bad

501
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,790
yeah we actually did get a lot of

502
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,090
feedback on this so yeah many

503
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:02,750
participants were not to voluntary real

504
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,879
CENTAC a true keep this level high but

505
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,280
we also had some participants at the

506
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,560
