1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,800
my name is camellia I'm a PhD candidate

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,169
at Stanford and I'd like to share with

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,150
you some work focused on ransomware this

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,630
is joint work with the Joe Bono Chris

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,880
gates and chard go well so as you might

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,860
know ransomware is a type of malware

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,860
that restrict access to a computer

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,170
typically by locking the computer or

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,470
encrypting data and demanding payment to

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,690
restore access so there's been a lot of

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,750
media attention focused on ransomware in

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,660
recent years this has been a large part

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,070
due to or driven by attacks on

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,870
government organizations and

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,180
high-profile industry targets

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,019
however it's thought that consumers are

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:58,110
actually the most targeted at and at

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,940
risk in part because they may have less

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,259
security less robust security in place

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,390
to protect them for example a report by

21
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:09,780
Symantec has found that two-thirds of

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,299
all infection two-thirds of all blocked

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,070
infections of ransomware has been have

24
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,979
been on the consumer side for the past

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,350
couple of years but very little is known

26
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,149
about the prevalence and characteristics

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,609
of these attacks on the general

28
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:27,390
population what proportion of people pay

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:32,449
how they perceive and react to to these

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,920
attacks various government organizations

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,560
researchers and industry have attempted

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,420
to document the phenomenon but results

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,280
have often been inconsistent and

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,649
difficult to compare against and

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,909
generalize to the general population

36
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,950
and this is in part based on due to the

37
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,249
fact that non representative data has

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,509
been used so government organizations

39
00:01:53,249 --> 00:02:00,689
such as the FBI's ic3 organization

40
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:02,219
relies on voluntary victim reports and

41
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,490
this is thought to be a gross

42
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,190
underestimate of the true rate industry

43
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,530
will report blocked infection rates of

44
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,359
the users of their software products and

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,400
of course these are users who

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,770
self-select into purchasing a software

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,970
security product and may not be

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,980
representative of the general population

49
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,310
more recently researchers have turned to

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,130
public

51
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:31,870
transactions to try and estimate losses

52
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,480
and infection rates so for example Huang

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,130
and I'll find 20,000 potential victims

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,200
globally who paid ransom using Bitcoin

55
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,870
but of course this you know one obvious

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,260
limitation here is that it's limited to

57
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,569
one payment method which again is not a

58
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,569
complete picture of what's going on so

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,209
we focused in this work on to answering

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,250
two questions first what is the

61
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,489
prevalence of ransomware for the general

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,300
population how many people are infected

63
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,750
and second can we predict who is at risk

64
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,620
so who's the vulnerable population is

65
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,569
and to do so we we developed a survey

66
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,280
tool that we administered to a

67
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:22,319
representative sample of the US

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,310
population the survey documented the

69
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,100
characteristics of the ransomware attack

70
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,790
experienced but also situational and

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:35,829
behavioral factors that may have led to

72
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:39,280
susceptibility okay so I'll first focus

73
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:42,610
on estimating prevalence we had a

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,730
representative sample of 1200 US adults

75
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,890
from YouGov YouGov is a global market

76
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,488
research firm that has over two million

77
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,750
members subscribed in the US and they do

78
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:58,290
make an effort to have on their panel

79
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,750
hard-to-reach populations and each

80
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,000
weighting adjustment so each respondent

81
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,310
had a weighting adjustment associated

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,530
with them and which was constructed by

83
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,530
matching to the 2010 American Community

84
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,660
Survey and this is a standard technique

85
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,010
to adjust for any remaining bias in the

86
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,750
convenience sample respondents

87
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,510
progressed through up to thirty

88
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,010
information in question pages we first

89
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,070
provided them with a definition of

90
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,280
ransomware screenshots of common strings

91
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,080
such as the one you see on the right we

92
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,679
asked them five questions on specific

93
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,248
tactics that are typical typically seen

94
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,929
and ransomware attacks

95
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:42,049
these might be things like did you see a

96
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:43,609
time we're counting down was your screen

97
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:46,578
lock did you notice that your files were

98
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:48,409
encrypted things like that and of course

99
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:52,209
is there do you see impersonation of the

100
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:54,739
law-enforcement agencies such as the FBI

101
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,079
we also asked them for a free text

102
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:59,619
description of what happened so tell us

103
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,879
what happened in your own words and

104
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:03,859
consequences of the attacks so how did

105
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,799
they remove the ransomware were they

106
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:10,248
able to did they pay and how did they

107
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:13,758
how did they react now as is the case

108
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:15,619
with most surveys our results are

109
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,749
limited by the fact that these are self

110
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:20,749
reports and so we can't know for sure

111
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:23,239
that respondents correctly identified

112
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:24,979
ransomware as such we did try to

113
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:29,179
mitigate these issues in a variety of

114
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:31,519
ways one of which was to pilot the

115
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:34,419
survey on Mechanical Turk prior to

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:40,939
running the study and making edits and

117
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:43,698
clarifications as needed and so and of

118
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:45,469
course so having access to this fairly

119
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,159
extensive list of questions also allowed

120
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:51,469
us to make sure that respondents answers

121
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:54,169
word fact consistent and tease out

122
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:56,748
inning allow us allowing us to further

123
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:02,779
verify that their answers were in fact

124
00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:05,919
incidents of ransom so initially we

125
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:09,469
found that five percent of respondents

126
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,349
self-identified as victims each of these

127
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:14,659
responses was manually reviewed and

128
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:17,709
classified reclassified when necessary

129
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:20,209
by two independent researchers and

130
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:23,059
following reclassification we found that

131
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:26,419
approximately three percent of users

132
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:29,149
were indeed ransomware victims so

133
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:32,389
although small this does correspond to

134
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:36,909
almost three million victims in the u.s.

135
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,909
which is I would say not insignificant

136
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:42,289
we found that almost half of the attacks

137
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,779
reported included some kind of police

138
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:49,409
impersonation such as the FBI example

139
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:51,569
you saw previously strains that included

140
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,119
encryption that encrypted data were much

141
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,879
less common than lockers drains which

142
00:06:54,119 --> 00:07:00,059
are typically easier to remove so 36

143
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:04,110
percent versus 74 the median and average

144
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:08,039
ransom reported was 250 and 500 and $10

145
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:11,399
respectively and consistent with prior

146
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:17,998
work few victims paid the ransom 4%

147
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:24,269
and/or notified authorities 10% now one

148
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:27,029
hypothesis is that the rise in adoption

149
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:28,739
of cryptocurrencies is really a major

150
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,229
driving force behind the ransomware

151
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:33,929
trend that we see and so we asked

152
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:36,479
respondents how were you asked to pay

153
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:39,359
the ransom this was a multiple choice

154
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,849
question so we're able to estimate a

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,269
lower bound on the distribution of

156
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:47,009
methods and we found that prepaid cash

157
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:50,599
vouchers and wire transfers together

158
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:53,249
accounted for over 56% of infections

159
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:56,998
dominating whereas cryptocurrencies

160
00:07:53,249 --> 00:08:02,819
accounted for only 12% so this result

161
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:05,039
sort of cast doubt on that hypothesis we

162
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,169
also asked respondents did you change

163
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,869
any behaviors follow following the

164
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,058
attack and we found that half of victims

165
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:16,199
reported changing two or more security

166
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:18,989
habits these were driven by more careful

167
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,629
browsing and behaviors related to AV

168
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:25,609
products so a lot of people either

169
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:30,059
purchased or updated their ad product

170
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,800
now whether people actually in fact

171
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:33,509
change their behaviors or this is due to

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,759
some kind of social desirability bias

173
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:40,589
that we're seeing we of course can't

174
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:44,068
know for sure but it does suggest that

175
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,509
people are attributing the cause of the

176
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,819
attack at least in part to their own

177
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:50,129
behaviors as opposed to adopting a view

178
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,579
of you know it was just random it wasn't

179
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,160
my fault

180
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:58,199
it's a freak accident that that kind of

181
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:01,829
randomly happened one other observation

182
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:02,490
that stood out to us here was that very

183
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,770
few

184
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,740
respondents started to back up their

185
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,800
data following the attack now this is

186
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,300
arguably the single most effective way

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,490
to mitigate against the ransomware

188
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,699
attack and avoid paying the ransom but

189
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,290
few people tended to do so suggesting

190
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,520
that maybe more awareness and education

191
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:31,860
is is maybe warranted to around the

192
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:36,300
security habit okay finally we we looked

193
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:40,230
at risk perceptions so the idea that or

194
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,969
one's awareness that they are at risk of

195
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,520
an adverse security event is thought to

196
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,460
play an important role in making the

197
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,630
security decisions so we asked

198
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:54,210
respondents two questions to get at this

199
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,990
first how likely do you think you are to

200
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,330
experience a future ransomware attack

201
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,920
and what is the likelihood that if you

202
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,860
were to get infected with a ransomware

203
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,959
attacked with ransomware today that you

204
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,940
and the only way to get your data back

205
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,980
would be to pay a ransom of three

206
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,240
hundred dollars how likely are you to

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,990
pay that ransom and respondents were

208
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,930
prompted here to report a number an

209
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,940
integer between 1 and 100 where one

210
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,910
means no and a hundred means yes

211
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,670
definitely and the table shows averages

212
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,530
across the victims and not vectors so we

213
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,890
find that victims believe there are more

214
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:38,760
at risk of a future attack and at the

215
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:41,550
same time less likely to pay so maybe

216
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,680
this is do be to having better

217
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,599
mitigation and strategies in place

218
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,270
following the attack or changing their

219
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,460
habits but we can't know for sure and

220
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,470
this is one area where it'd be

221
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,330
interesting to do further work and

222
00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:02,040
really tease out and understand what's

223
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:05,370
driving the differences ok so shifting

224
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,290
now to susceptibility a natural question

225
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,710
is of course you know given that the

226
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:13,589
costs of a ransomware infection are

227
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,670
pretty high given in terms of monetary

228
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,700
and fine

229
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:22,890
time can we identify the at-risk

230
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,840
population so we try to predict

231
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:29,310
ransomware infection using our survey

232
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:31,730
responses we had questions on

233
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:36,140
demographics socioeconomic status the

234
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:41,040
technology used so for example OS type

235
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,560
browser the computer savviness which was

236
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,640
measured via and a question multiple

237
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:51,060
choice test about 10 to 12 security

238
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,939
habits and a binary indicator of whether

239
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,750
or not the respondent was had been

240
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,000
exposed to an online scam previous so

241
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,670
we've had two models a linear model of

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,030
the lasso and a nonlinear model the

243
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:10,170
gradient booster trees and in the table

244
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:11,550
is average AUC across ten folds and you

245
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,079
can see that results are fairly

246
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:18,750
consistent between the two models so

247
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:23,210
what we found was that after controlling

248
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:25,800
for security habits and online exposure

249
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,860
the situational factors such as

250
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,500
demographics and socioeconomic status

251
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,020
really didn't hold any predictive power

252
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,390
so this is a nice result sort of

253
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,230
speaking to the power of having good

254
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,630
security outcomes and you can see that

255
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:48,120
the performance is on par with the

256
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:50,220
saturated model using all features so

257
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,230
having said that collecting this type of

258
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:59,220
data may be costly and difficult so we

259
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:03,210
proposed a also a simpler approach to

260
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,940
risk assessment and this is a sort of

261
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,970
proof of concept risk rubric that

262
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:12,780
consumers can use to estimate their own

263
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:17,310
risk of infection so it was constructed

264
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:19,980
using the tuned lasso model and where we

265
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,540
rounded and scale the coefficients to

266
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,810
integers from one to ten

267
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,630
and it consisted only six questions

268
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:31,020
so these focused on

269
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,990
toran behaviors backing up and data

270
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,780
encryption habits exposure to online

271
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,950
scams two-factor authentication usage

272
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:45,900
and password protecting prosser password

273
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:48,330
protection for login habits and the

274
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,459
output is a risk score for each user the

275
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,460
higher the score the more at-risk users

276
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:59,100
okay so we wanted to see that whether

277
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:02,010
the model was calibrated the in the plot

278
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:08,180
here you see the scores grouped into

279
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:10,830
buckets of five each each point is a

280
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,130
contains anywhere between three to

281
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,710
thirteen infections and the sizes

282
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:20,160
indicate that the number of users in

283
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:23,390
that and the y-axis is the likelihood of

284
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,760
ransomware infection predicted by a

285
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:30,420
model where the sole predictor was this

286
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,000
risk or product predicted by the the

287
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,920
risk rubric and we can see that as the

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,170
score increases the likelihood of

289
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,150
infection also increases giving us

290
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,810
confidence that the model is indeed

291
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,579
calibrated and of course we see that we

292
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:50,790
don't really lose anything in terms of

293
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:53,180
predictive performance okay so to

294
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,290
conclude we provide the first

295
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,780
representative estimate of ransomware

296
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,560
infection for the general population

297
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,589
this was 3% for the year that we

298
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,930
measured and of course an interesting

299
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,240
future work here excuse me is whether

300
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,310
the this number is increasing and at

301
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,580
what rate which will require further

302
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,739
longitudinal studies we also found that

303
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,140
susceptibility to ransomware infection

304
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,900
can be predicted just from self-reported

305
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:26,610
security habits and exposure to online

306
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:28,680
scams and finally we presented a proof

307
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,140
of concept approach for consumers to

308
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,390
self assess their risk of infection so

309
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,340
it's fast transparent and requires

310
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,810
limited information these are all

311
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:42,560
features that previous work has found to

312
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:45,319
make risk rubrics very more acceptable

313
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,160
to users but of course future research

314
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:51,590
is required to really gauge user

315
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,420
reaction to these models and also to

316
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,150
robustly test them before they can be

317
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,150
responsibly used on the general

318
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,949
population so I'll stop here for

319
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,949
questions feel free to reach out with

320
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:12,200
any any questions our feedback thank you

321
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:12,200
[Applause]

322
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,720
hey Alyssa Red miles Micro have research

323
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,630
and Princeton I think it's interesting

324
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,920
that a lot of the predictive questions

325
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,450
in the questionnaire we're pretty

326
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,370
general is your hypothesis that

327
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,770
predicting ransomware risk would also

328
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,380
generalize well to predicting say risk

329
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,779
of falling for spam or other negative

330
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,720
security consequences or do you think

331
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:50,180
that wouldn't work hmm it's a really

332
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:54,670
interesting question so I'm you know I'm

333
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:59,479
not sure what to say on the spot here I

334
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:01,699
would like to think that's true but at

335
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,320
yeah at the same time you know if

336
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,939
fishing for example comes two different

337
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,010
mediums and has become very

338
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:11,240
sophisticated

339
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:17,540
so yeah I'm hesitant to say yes I but I

340
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:19,250
would like to say thanks you you lose

341
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,959
just a few ways that ransomware

342
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,839
infection rates have been measured

343
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,300
including the long 2018 paper I wonder

344
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,010
if you extrapolated your finding of the

345
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,580
percentage of attacks that were due to

346
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,960
paid through Bitcoin to the other

347
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,550
methods you found if you would get the

348
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,190
rough

349
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:42,830
range of long 2018 yeah we we did that

350
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,650
the caveat there is that it required

351
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:51,460
various assumptions to kind of line up

352
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,460
the numbers we did that for I believe

353
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,330
all all three of these reports and the

354
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,350
results are in the paper and we did find

355
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,929
that ball ballpark they were consistent

356
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,669
but again it required various

357
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,780
assumptions because for example the hong

358
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:14,000
paper only looks at crypto currencies

359
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,000
and/or Bitcoin payments and those that

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,450
paid and we had no idea to how to

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,580
extrapolate like Global payment rates so

362
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,800
we used our number and so there's a lot

363
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,300
of caveats to that which is partly what

364
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,310
motivated the work in that it's very

365
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,770
difficult to extrapolate from each of

366
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:37,760
these individual numbers to a

367
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:41,500
generalized estimate yep my question is

368
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,720
the general perception that people have

369
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:49,190
towards their privacy is I don't have

370
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,740
anything to hide and I why would anybody

371
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,830
want to attack me you know especially

372
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,000
ransom there so if people have such

373
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:01,639
attitude my question to you then is what

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,820
kind of demographics did you see we're

375
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,160
more prone to such ransomware attacks

376
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,520
was it a specific age group or people

377
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:14,560
belonging to a specific economic status

378
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:21,350
or education status something like that

379
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:24,020
so we I don't have R is so I don't want

380
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,629
to say speak to that directly because

381
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,210
sort of our results point to the fact

382
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,240
that demographics and socioeconomic

383
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:35,000
status weren't at all as predictive

384
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,740
anywhere near as predictive as after

385
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,830
taking account these security habits and

386
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,540
online scams so if you look at the just

387
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,600
comparing the accuracies of these models

388
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,999
here the one with security habits in

389
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,728
extreme

390
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:50,329
scam pretty much performs like on par

391
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:52,859
with the saturated model versus

392
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:55,589
demographics and socioeconomic status is

393
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:59,188
ten percentage point lower accuracy so I

394
00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:02,129
I think there's yai

395
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:04,109
we found limited I guess usability and

396
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:06,708
trying to tease that out given the

397
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,708
results

398
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:24,359
within the consequences that you saw I

399
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:28,269
was wondering if you can tease out

400
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,949
something about like how how much data

401
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,619
did they actually lose how much did they

402
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,109
suffer for it just given the low

403
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:36,728
percentage that you saw of people

404
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,649
deciding to do backups which you were

405
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:40,899
thinking might be an awareness issue but

406
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:42,279
it may also be you know that if they

407
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:46,029
have all their stuff on cloud services

408
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:51,549
or if they don't really think of it like

409
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:54,579
I am setting up a backup that's that's

410
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,979
in the paper in terms of the amount of

411
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:59,320
the number of people that lost data as

412
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:04,839
the result of the attack

413
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:08,049
I believe don't quote me on this but I

414
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:11,559
believe close to 30 percent 25 percent

415
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:16,809
or 30 percent lost data as a result of

416
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:24,070
the attack and I think in part that's

417
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:27,999
driven by the the main or the focus

418
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:31,139
being unlocker ransomware

419
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:36,009
which is easy to circle to circle events

420
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:39,458
then the encryption ransomware so that

421
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:42,429
may be partly driving the result of not

422
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:44,589
backing up data but we we can't really

423
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,200
know for sure it'd be interesting to

424
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:49,349
follow up on that for sure I won't quote

425
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,349
you

426
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,070
[Applause]
