1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,280
so hi everyone my name is ish enzo from

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,080
university of michigan today i'm happy

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,730
to present this drawing collaboration

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,290
with carnegie mellon university on

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,810
website privacy choices so privacy

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,849
choices are mandated by regulations over

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,099
the world from the European Union to the

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,110
United States

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,239
the three most commonly mandated types

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,640
are opt outs for email communications

11
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:42,019
opt outs for targeted advertising and

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,479
choices for data deletion do users care

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:50,030
about privacy the answer is obviously

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:51,890
yes in 2016 pure national survey 65% of

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,989
respondents that is very important to

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,860
them to control what information is

17
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:00,559
collected about them 86% reported taking

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,080
steps to remove or mask their digital

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,070
footprints ranging from clearing cookies

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,798
to delete in post on social media our

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,679
privacy choice is usable the answer is

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,020
unfortunately no as reflected by prior

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,450
research which were conducted as either

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,880
large-scale measurement analysis or

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,270
small-scale user studies based on a

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,100
limited set of tools or websites our

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,460
studies is in the middle in terms of

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,070
method as a manual in-depth counting

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,190
analysis of privacy choices on 150

30
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,740
websites we chose to focus on email

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,620
communications targeted ads opt outs and

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,479
data deletion choices as this are the

33
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,500
most mandated three types of by

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:48,260
regulation we're interested in knowing

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,470
how this mandated privacy choices are

36
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,990
provided in practice specifically what

37
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,600
choices related to email communications

38
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,929
targeted advertising and data dilution

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,339
do websites offer and second how our

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,890
websites presenting these privacy

41
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,820
choices to their visitors and what are

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,068
the potential usability issues for each

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,349
web set we went through different places

44
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:15,349
to check the process of privacy choices

45
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:18,018
first we'll go to the home page observe

46
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,499
it has any cookie notices or link to

47
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:23,790
privacy choices after that we created a

48
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:26,879
user account using a provided name and

49
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,798
no address third we go through the

50
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,048
websites privacy policy and find

51
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,349
description of privacy choices in text

52
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:37,890
and force we repeat the same procedure

53
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:40,858
for account settings while going through

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,379
each website we filed out an analysis

55
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,819
template including 82 questions to

56
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,790
standardize the data recording

57
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,339
procedures examples of questions include

58
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,069
location such as where's their choice is

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,459
located as privacy policy account

60
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,429
settings or other places level of detail

61
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,170
such as for an email opt out as a

62
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,159
describe what specific types of

63
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,649
communication that can be opted out the

64
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,929
third one is link availability do they

65
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,230
use one or multiple links and do all

66
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,269
links lead to the relevant page

67
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:19,260
interaction path how many user actions

68
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,900
are required to exercise their choice we

69
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,349
randomly sample 150 web sites from the

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,769
Lexus top global top 10 key sites as of

71
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:31,470
March 2018 particularly we stratify the

72
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,510
sample based on site traffic with 50

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,690
sites from the top middle and button

74
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,060
tiers respectively this is to understand

75
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,019
the potential influence from website

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,599
popularity we analyzed all 150 web sites

77
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,639
between April and October 2018

78
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,629
half of them were double coated with a

79
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,849
high internal reliability most of our

80
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,659
analyzed web sites are registered in the

81
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,159
US while Europe was the second host area

82
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:01,798
notably because our analysis was

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,440
conducted using u.s. IP addresses the

84
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,970
results we observed only reflect the

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,099
state's quote for us-based users so what

86
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,949
do we find for website privacy choices

87
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,320
and will a structure our key findings

88
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,060
around three aspects their presence on

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,740
different websites how they were

90
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,360
described and potential usability issues

91
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,400
first an encouraging finding is that

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,240
privacy choices were commonly offered

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,679
across top middle and low traffic tiers

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,570
when looking at this graph you notice

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,700
most of the sites that use email

96
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,930
communications or targeted advertising

97
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,419
provided a respect

98
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,370
tip up towel mechanism and this lack of

99
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:45,060
Troyes problem occurs slightly more

100
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,190
severely for data deletion other types

101
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,410
of opt-out we observed which are less

102
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,289
common are those for web analytic

103
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,270
services third-party sharing on earth do

104
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:58,110
not track request and opt outs for

105
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,090
cookies in looking at the location of

106
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,610
privacy choices either in account

107
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,039
settings privacy policy or more than one

108
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,780
location we notice for email

109
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,050
communication opt outs intended to

110
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,940
appear at multiple places

111
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,039
comparatively presence of targeted ads

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,639
opt outs and data deletion choices were

113
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,229
more centralized toward privacy policies

114
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,699
the location distribution patterns are

115
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:24,530
quite similar for websites with

116
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:27,090
top-middle or traffic or pattern traffic

117
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,789
moving on to a description of privacy

118
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,619
choices problems start to emerge first

119
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,419
it's a websites described as privacy

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,740
choices with very poor readability

121
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,229
looking at this flash King cake rate

122
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,320
level scores for tax in privacy policy

123
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:46,550
that describes this choices they all had

124
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,719
a mean around 13 this means on average

125
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,490
comprehending attacks were required the

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,970
audience to have university level

127
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,349
reading abilities interestingly

128
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,900
understanding the privacy policy tax in

129
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:00,990
general is slightly easier but still not

130
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,539
ideal as comparison materials addressed

131
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,250
to the general public a suggested to aim

132
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,539
for a score between seven and nine

133
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,669
another problem regarding a tax

134
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,979
description is the lack of consensus in

135
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:17,969
the wordings used to present privacy

136
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,620
choices taking the headers the headings

137
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,259
of the sections that described as

138
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,539
privacy choices as an example we noticed

139
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,590
that some terms were evenly distributed

140
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,270
such as your choice for all three types

141
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,090
however there are unique terms for

142
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,870
certain types of choices such as opt-out

143
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,989
for email communication third party for

144
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:43,860
targeted ads and you're right for data

145
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,539
deletion and furthermore no single and

146
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,090
grande occurred in more than twenty of

147
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,039
our analyzed policies this lack of

148
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,619
consistency across websites

149
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,250
make it hard for users to locate choices

150
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,520
in privacy policies here's a snapshot of

151
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,230
the headings for data dilution choices

152
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,570
companies like parks and Netflix had a

153
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,840
relatively simple such as your choice

154
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,460
and data subjects rights other companies

155
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,469
would use longer and more concrete

156
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,109
headings such as Lincoln's

157
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,690
rise to access and control your personal

158
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,750
data and Facebook's how can I manage or

159
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:23,219
delete information about me moreover

160
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,700
ambiguity exists regarding what actually

161
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,530
happened when a choice is exercised

162
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,099
among the 80 sites that mentions trying

163
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,289
to advertising in their privacy policy

164
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:38,160
50% did not describe the opt-out would

165
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,990
stop tracking entirely or not and 90% in

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,180
a specified whether the opt-out applied

167
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:47,040
to across multiple browsers or devices

168
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,400
the same ambiguity issues exists for

169
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,020
data deletion choices among the 108

170
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,979
websites offering data deletion

171
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,109
mechanisms 83% did not describe a time

172
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:02,700
frame one that when the account will be

173
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,680
permanently deleted for usability we

174
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,630
also found severe issues that could

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,480
likely make this privacy choices

176
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:13,620
difficult or impossible to use starting

177
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,380
from requiring too many user actions we

178
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,770
counted user actions as clicks hovers

179
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,719
checkboxes and forum views we counted

180
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,270
the user actions required to exercise

181
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,450
the choice from the home page just for

182
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,430
the shortest path and the number is 5.3

183
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,000
for email opt outs and data deletion

184
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,729
choices and 3.2 for targeted ads opt out

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,590
notice that this is just for the

186
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,349
shortest path and it's conducted by

187
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,390
researchers who are experienced and know

188
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,180
where to go to to find these choices an

189
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,400
average first-time user is likely to

190
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,630
spend more time as struggles in figuring

191
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,630
out the right path

192
00:08:54,009 --> 00:09:01,430
here's an example on New York Times

193
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:04,370
which we should clarify is just you okay

194
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,439
here's the video which is valid uses to

195
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,199
illustrate larger issues instead of

196
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,810
targeting any specific companies here it

197
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:14,029
can takes up to 38 user access to

198
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,310
complete a data deletion request form

199
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,589
starting from finding the right link to

200
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,349
the form in privacy policy select

201
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,380
deleted as a type of request scroll down

202
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,920
and select the right product or service

203
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,110
from the list of 22 up options then the

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,709
user also needs to fill out name email

205
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,380
address country etc plus for checkboxes

206
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:39,609
and the resep recapture at the end of

207
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,610
this very lengthy process

208
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,750
additionally confusion may occur why

209
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,610
website when websites have multiple

210
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,060
links leading to different opt-out tools

211
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:53,509
for the same purpose take Twitter's

212
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,130
targeted ads up now for example first in

213
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:58,430
the account settings you can find the

214
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,620
opt-out provided by Twitter itself if

215
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,680
you navigate to the about Us page

216
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,470
it also shows up top provided by DAA and

217
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,920
then I as well as Google for its web

218
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:12,199
analytics if you go to Twitter's privacy

219
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,969
policy only the one provided by Twitter

220
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,579
and naa will show up here

221
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,120
all of this links to multiple opt-out

222
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,060
tools

223
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,980
spanning across multiple pages may cause

224
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,660
confusion about which tool should be

225
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,940
prioritized and what their differences

226
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:32,380
are lastly we know that several poor

227
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:36,319
design choices that may impact usability

228
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,180
here's an example from Amazon to opt out

229
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:41,449
of email communications your first

230
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,489
encounter a list of 69 check boxes for

231
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:46,670
different categories then at the very

232
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,920
very end of the list you'll notice an

233
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,110
opt-out of all check box titled do not

234
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,759
send me any marketing communications and

235
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,920
you'll need to remember to click the

236
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,060
Update button to make sure the choice is

237
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,579
exercised

238
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,099
well this opt-out for all button is now

239
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,170
visible on top a first-time user may be

240
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,209
scared away immediately just because

241
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,400
they think they need to uncheck all 16

242
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:11,930
eye boxes and the process is too

243
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:14,240
and hassle so after hearing so many

244
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,540
issues you may wonder how do we improve

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,640
website privacy choices we summarize our

246
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,010
recommendations based on the interaction

247
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,730
cycle which divides human interaction

248
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,110
with systems into four stages planning

249
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,870
translation physical action and

250
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,970
assessment I will next highlight one key

251
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,830
recommendation for each stage but feel

252
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,190
free to refer to our paper for more

253
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,410
details for the planning stage to help

254
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,570
users find a specific privacy choices

255
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,459
more easily a starting point can be

256
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,610
standardized in section headings in

257
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,040
privacy policies one example how this

258
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,170
can work is the model privacy notice

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,510
form that US financial institutions are

260
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,130
suggested to use for compliance with the

261
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,110
GLBA

262
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,390
though this might not be perfect exactly

263
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,280
a good initiative and research have

264
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,390
shown that this can contribute to lower

265
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,610
ambiguity in privacy policies for the

266
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,189
translation stage to help users plan now

267
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,990
the actions to exercise the choice more

268
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,710
efforts should be put to simplify the

269
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,270
process of learning of those in cases

270
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,280
where websites provides links to

271
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,980
multiple targeted ads opt-out such as

272
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,500
Twitter user can really benefit from a

273
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,810
single interface such as our privacy

274
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,290
Center that unifies multiple choice

275
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,750
mechanisms for the same purpose if this

276
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,430
is not technically feasible whether both

277
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,410
a website should at least provide

278
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,839
adequate explanation of what the

279
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,280
differences are between multiple opt-out

280
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,940
tools and which one should be

281
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,220
prioritized for the physical action

282
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,770
stage to help users exercise the choice

283
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,310
better and intuitive step is to reduce

284
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:54,230
the number of required actions in the

285
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,660
New York Times example there should be

286
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,420
an option to delete user account from

287
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,100
all services well if the user really

288
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,020
wants to do it just for Selective

289
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,600
Service they should at least be able to

290
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,180
do it in one single form in formats such

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,660
as the list of checkboxes instead of the

292
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,489
current drop-down list and finally many

293
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,650
of the form fields can be eliminated so

294
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,230
that a only asked users to provide

295
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:21,120
minimal information that's necessary to

296
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,190
perform this data deletion request

297
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,690
and similarly for the Amazons cased the

298
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,550
up dog our button should really be

299
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,040
placed at the top of the page rather

300
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,599
than at the button two of why the cases

301
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,660
where the users waste their time on

302
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,519
checking our boxes or even giving up opt

303
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,740
in now because the process looks too

304
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:43,389
complicated at the first glance it's

305
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,699
conceivable that many companies may

306
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,430
deliberately making this privacy choices

307
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,979
unusable for their visitors and in this

308
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,310
case it's regulators responsibility to

309
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,680
combat such dark patterns previous cases

310
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,040
exist such as a ruling by the French

311
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,630
Data Protection Authority on Google for

312
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,910
failing to provide notice in an easily

313
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,250
accessible form and fell into the obtain

314
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,889
users valid consent to data processing

315
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,389
for a personalization and similarly for

316
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:15,310
FTC's recent following on Facebook for

317
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,959
the assessment stage to help users

318
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,599
better evaluate the outcomes of

319
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,790
exercising privacy choices we can start

320
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,459
by providing more detailed explanation

321
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,500
for choice outcomes this means to

322
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:28,420
something like this choice will only

323
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,360
apply to the specific browser or device

324
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,660
from which you opt out as in the example

325
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,540
of dailymotion or we will delete your

326
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,649
full profile within 90 days as in the

327
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,569
example of github so in summary today I

328
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,570
present our study on website privacy

329
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,360
choices which are prevalent but still

330
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,420
severe issues existing regards their

331
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,220
description and usability we call for a

332
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,349
joint effort between companies and

333
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,720
regulators to ensure usability of

334
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,279
privacy choices thank you all for

335
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,019
listening to my presentation my name is

336
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,050
Ian zofran University of Michigan and

337
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:11,700
the happy to take any questions

338
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:13,900
[Applause]

339
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,740
thank you folks to come to the center

340
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,740
bikes with questions

341
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,930
there aren't any questions yet I have a

342
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,100
question you showed in the beginning

343
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,050
there's a bunch of different regulatory

344
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,389
requirements um what are your thoughts

345
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,550
on the ways usable ways to combine all

346
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,870
the different regulatory requirements in

347
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,339
a usable way especially around things

348
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,740
like standardizing language and stuff

349
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:42,410
like that so yeah thank you that's a

350
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,769
great question I feel a way to combine

351
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,079
regulations together is to make sure the

352
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,930
regulations stipulate specific

353
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,660
requirements so a counter example which

354
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,239
I can think of is in gdpr when it says

355
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,550
using clear and plain language for

356
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,860
either things like data breach

357
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,829
notifications or privacy policies it

358
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,190
doesn't really tell how to achieve that

359
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:09,258
all clear and plain language and so I

360
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,889
feel as a starting point if you want to

361
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:14,870
establish specific requirements in the

362
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,029
regulations that can be a good point to

363
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,350
really tell companies how to achieve the

364
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,350
things we want you to achieve

365
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,670
- I'm Cory Ferris from Carnegie Mellon

366
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,970
it's a nice to see you again at Supes

367
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,829
congratulations on this I'm curious have

368
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,889
you guys reached out to the companies

369
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:36,769
involved in the study to get to notify

370
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,930
them and maybe get their feedback oh we

371
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:40,550
haven't done so so far about to my

372
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,589
knowledge our team is working on an

373
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,508
update which hopefully can be published

374
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,670
on media and in that way attract more

375
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:50,920
attention for companies you notice there

376
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,920
are changes to be made thank you

377
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,290
University really great presentation I

378
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:00,339
was curious

379
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,899
given that this kind of scenario

380
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:04,549
involves different stakeholders which

381
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:08,630
includes the companies and the

382
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:11,510
regulators but also the users so how

383
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:16,929
important do you think is the user input

384
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:20,929
in in creating more accessible and more

385
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:23,870
usable privacy policies and interfaces

386
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:25,939
um - main user input is extremely

387
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:28,489
important and that's like approach

388
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,790
called user centric privacy design that

389
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,230
takes user input into the cycle of

390
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,320
designing and implementing privacy

391
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,210
choices

392
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,460
especially I think if it's just

393
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,950
companies working with regulators and

394
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,490
stimulates specific things to be done

395
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,890
with it

396
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,920
they don't necessarily take the insight

397
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,930
from known tech savvy users and

398
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,540
especially for experts like a security

399
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,310
and privacy we know all those things but

400
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,170
we are already familiar in the field for

401
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,780
such a long time so maybe we need

402
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,140
fresher perspective from the users to

403
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,760
make sure they are actually usable for

404
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,590
them hi thank you i'm pilar from

405
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,710
1password

406
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:15,750
and i was wondering if you have stumbled

407
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:19,530
upon this service that we've seen a lot

408
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,120
of basically you are social privacy

409
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,730
conscious that you allow this

410
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,300
third-party company will read and write

411
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,620
access to your email and they just

412
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,610
machine-gun every company they can think

413
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,500
of with billion requests and the person

414
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,590
doesn't even know who's getting the

415
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,470
deletion request so we have to be a lot

416
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:43,260
more careful with actually enacting it

417
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:46,590
but have you seen anything about this

418
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,420
service or bad side effects of it so

419
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,840
that will be a service that perform data

420
00:18:48,420 --> 00:19:01,620
deletion request in representative of

421
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:03,870
you every company they have I may have

422
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,870
heard of this service I don't I haven't

423
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,719
used this kind of service before oh I

424
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:12,389
cannot speak for their practice about

425
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,340
how shady or how pervasive they are in

426
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,950
performing this I think the intention is

427
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,050
good but if a user one should use that

428
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,840
make sure you read their privacy

429
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:24,389
policies terms and conditions and that's

430
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,260
not enough I think there should also be

431
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,000
like regulations or some kind of

432
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,950
supervision on this type of service to

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,260
make sure even though the purpose of

434
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,600
school they are not invading users

435
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,920
privacy none either intentional or

436
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,919
unintentional way

437
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:50,219
thank you

438
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,219
