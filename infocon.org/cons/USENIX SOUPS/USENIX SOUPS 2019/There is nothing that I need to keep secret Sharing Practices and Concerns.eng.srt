00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,740
hello everyone my name is Abdul Majeed

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,390
our Kotani I'm a business student from

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,960
UNC Charlotte

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,550
I'll present my paper on sharing and the

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:27,890
privacy concerns of users variable

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:31,310
fitness devices so wearable fitness

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,780
devices are one of the most adopted IOT

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,989
devices and it is the top-selling

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,630
devices in market reports estimates that

10
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:41,930
reports estimate that more than 70% of

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:45,890
the devices of the variables that would

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,620
be sold in 2020 are fitness trackers and

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,550
smart watches which also include or

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,050
provide fitness tracking capability

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:58,959
these devices sense and collect a

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:04,399
variety of data like heart rate calories

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,740
step count location among gathers many

18
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:09,110
of the wearable fitness surfaces enable

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,289
users to share their data with other

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,050
individuals and with organizations so

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,720
user users can share their data within

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:21,640
the device military and social circles

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,789
or externally on social media and

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,490
external online health and fitness

25
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:32,470
platforms

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,449
however sharing since the activity data

27
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:38,560
can expose users to several risk for

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,540
example when a user share data such as

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,700
step count or distance routes can be

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:49,340
used to pinpoint user home address or

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,920
other sensitive locations such as

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:57,170
military sites there is also a concern

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,210
that fitness tracker data can be used by

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,509
third parties such as insurance

35
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,130
companies can be used for other purposes

36
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:08,179
to increase for example by the insurance

37
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:10,250
companies to increase consumers coverage

38
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,830
rates or by employers to basely share

39
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,549
their promotion decisions based on an

40
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,030
employee health status so these are some

41
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:23,239
examples and there are different other

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,620
scenarios where users data can be at

43
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,550
risk a previous work on sharing and

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,850
privacy of fresno state examines user

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,090
motivations users shared their data in

46
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,560
order to stay accountable and to get

47
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,860
social support and to compete with

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:48,130
others and there has been extensive work

49
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:52,600
on sharing activity data on social media

50
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,060
and workplaces so users wanted to access

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,940
larger number of audiences by sharing

52
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,070
their data on social media and to

53
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,520
promote their physical activity within

54
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:06,010
the work place environment privacy

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,900
concerns were also examined and they

56
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:14,649
found that users do not find the data

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,150
from activity trackers sensitive but

58
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,920
they are concerned about other data

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,390
collected by these devices like location

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,980
and they are also concerned about

61
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,040
unintended use and lack of control over

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,049
their data other all studies also

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,040
examined the privacy policies of

64
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,020
wearable fitness companies and they

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,100
found that some of the policies some of

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,890
the companies did not comply with the

67
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,220
existing regulations regarding data

68
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,630
practices users have also a limited

69
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,650
knowledge about those practices

70
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:52,930
according to another study so far

71
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,170
previous studies examined the sharing

72
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:00,330
and privacy primarily on social media

73
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,339
and in the workplace in workplaces

74
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:07,020
focusing on users goals and their

75
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,709
perceptions we wanted to we wanted to

76
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:14,830
have a broader view of all forms of

77
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,418
sharing so we wanted to examine in our

78
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,750
study we wanted to examine sharing as

79
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:21,370
one important aspect of privacy

80
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,820
therefore our goals in this study were

81
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,580
to understand how long-term users of

82
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,120
fitness trackers share their data and

83
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,800
what privacy decisions they make when

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,140
they share data with different audiences

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,919
and with different organizations so you

86
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,800
conducted semi-structured interview with

87
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,930
users of fitness trackers

88
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,450
in order to get insights about their

89
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,139
actual sharing behaviors we restricted

90
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,760
participation to people who have three

91
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,100
months at least three months of a device

92
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,289
used and who shared some information we

93
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,480
advertised our study and relevant online

94
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,740
forums and we interviewed 30

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,950
participants 15 beers and 15 females

96
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,830
they came they came from different

97
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,870
backgrounds and from different from

98
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,229
different educational backgrounds and

99
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:20,389
their age ranged from 20 to 51 they also

100
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,570
utilized a variety of fitness trackers

101
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:28,410
including wrists devices such as Fitbit

102
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:30,900
smart rings just a swab and among other

103
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,210
devices the interview questions were

104
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,388
structured into three parts the first

105
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,430
part focused on the general usage of a

106
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,560
device by the participants and the

107
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,000
second part we asked them about their

108
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,389
sharing practices we'll ask them

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
questions such as with whom they share

110
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,850
their information and in what platforms

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,060
and why in the last parts of the

112
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,030
interview you ask them about the

113
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,800
prophecy concerns we asked them how they

114
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,659
think their information can be misused

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,460
and what they do to manage their

116
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,289
information we trust the inductive

117
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,159
coding to analyze the interview

118
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,900
transcripts so moving into the results

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,539
the first part of the result is about

120
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,330
general usage so similar to previous

121
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,700
studies findings we found that users

122
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,210
utilize their participants utilize the

123
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,430
trackers for several purposes mainly to

124
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,469
track their activity and to stay

125
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,910
accountable however we found a

126
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,970
considerable number of people in our

127
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,830
study share their data with with

128
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,010
caregivers for medical reasons for

129
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,960
example we have fun participant she has

130
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,020
sleep apnea and she used her device to

131
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,020
track hair sleep another participant has

132
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:51,090
had back surgery and she used the device

133
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:54,810
to track her standing and walking after

134
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,270
the surgery most of the participants use

135
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:01,710
their devices all times others be

136
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:04,258
during workouts so prior to starting our

137
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,940
study we assumed that sharing platforms

138
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:11,310
and backed users behaviors however we

139
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,069
found that platforms had less to do with

140
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:17,990
users behaviors than they're sharing

141
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:21,590
goals and related audiences so our study

142
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:25,620
presents a set of sharing goals

143
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,690
audiences and specific practices from

144
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,120
participant free services we identified

145
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,050
six category or the recipients of their

146
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,889
data friends family strangers physicians

147
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:42,150
and center programs and co-workers some

148
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:45,990
participants utilized multiple patterns

149
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:48,270
based on their goals so starting with

150
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,819
the friends the majority of participants

151
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,198
shared their data with friends so they

152
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,940
share their data in order to stay

153
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,080
accountable and to compete with their

154
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,849
B's and to to brag about achievements

155
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,430
they said they share basic data with

156
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:09,270
their friends such as tip count they are

157
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:12,479
unwilling to share body weight and other

158
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,909
data that might impact them because they

159
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,860
are concerned about their friends

160
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:18,750
judgments of their lack of activities

161
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:26,729
especially those who may not have time

162
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:29,009
to exercise also participants who share

163
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,449
their data friends prefer to share their

164
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,659
data on social media channels like

165
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:36,990
Facebook and Twitter however a few

166
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,990
raised concerns about sharing their

167
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,000
their data on those cells because those

168
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,490
channels they said they have different

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,680
networks of connection and sometimes it

170
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,660
may not be ever ready to share activity

171
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,609
data with different networks of

172
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,370
connections like professionals the

173
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,579
second category of the recipients are

174
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,450
family as family so participants

175
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,099
mentioned that they share their data

176
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,900
with family in order to have their

177
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,560
family maintain healthy lifestyle and to

178
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,670
also help themselves

179
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,768
had a lifestyle so they said they felt

180
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,839
comfortable sharing everything with

181
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,509
their family because they felt

182
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,120
responsible to toward their family and

183
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:25,990
to share any experience with a good or

184
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,519
bad with their family members then you

185
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,559
try simple techniques to share their

186
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:34,439
data so just by talking or by showing

187
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,439
family member their data in the device

188
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,319
the third category of the recipients are

189
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:45,430
strangers so about the servants share

190
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:47,920
their data with strangers in order to

191
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:53,019
get advice regarding some health goals

192
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:56,229
like losing weight so they utilize the

193
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:59,350
device built in social circles or online

194
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,209
fitness and health communities we ask

195
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,449
them if they are okay to share their

196
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:08,369
data with unknown people and they said

197
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:12,248
they are okay because they do not expect

198
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:17,559
harm from people having same goals as

199
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:20,980
themselves others were not concerned

200
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,779
because they use fake information in

201
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,370
their profiles and all of the

202
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,069
participants mention that they do not

203
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:33,339
share location data because they are

204
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:34,779
concerned about their safety we were

205
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,660
surprised by the number of people who

206
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,209
share their data with caregivers so we

207
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,939
have about six or seven participants

208
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,680
share their data with caregivers as I

209
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:48,939
mentioned they share the data in order

210
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:54,339
to track some medical conditions or to

211
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:56,800
track their vital signs so they say they

212
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,870
said they they are okay and they are

213
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,000
comfortable sharing or friendly with

214
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,389
their doctors and they make sure to

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,089
record everything precisely because they

216
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,559
think it's good for their to hold their

217
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,199
health to merge their information

218
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,850
accurately with accurate information

219
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,529
however some are frustrated when

220
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,970
frustrated with the current way they

221
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:20,199
utilize to share their data because they

222
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,840
compiled data manually and checked with

223
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:25,329
the doctors and they wish to have

224
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:32,170
somewhat emitted way to share their data

225
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:34,270
with with their physicians some of the

226
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,640
participants also share their data with

227
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,079
financial incentive programs so they

228
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,380
share their data in order to receive

229
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,860
some incentives like discount on the

230
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:47,830
purchases from a pharmacy or discount

231
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,620
and the insurance so they connect their

232
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,510
data with those parties those parties

233
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,660
will pull out their data from their

234
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:57,850
fitness trackers mainly step counts and

235
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,550
to admit that they their main goal for

236
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,810
sharing their activity data is to to

237
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:07,260
receive the incentive we also ask them

238
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,420
if they are comfortable and they said

239
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,819
they are ok because it just counts and

240
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,900
the step count are harmless step count

241
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:21,940
is harmless only one participant

242
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:24,730
mentioned he is concerned about abusing

243
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,650
his data by the insurance company in the

244
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,700
future but he considered himself healthy

245
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:33,040
now and he's not concerned right now the

246
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,320
last category of the recipients of users

247
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,420
data are co-workers so similar to

248
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,290
previous studies findings we found that

249
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,740
some some users share their data with

250
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,579
co-workers so sharing with co-workers is

251
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,520
more friendly competition and

252
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:54,400
participants find it an opportunity to

253
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,319
to increase their physical activity some

254
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,689
of the co-workers may not been

255
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,140
personally known to the user but they

256
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,140
say it again at step count and it is

257
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,140
harmless

258
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,920
the last part so first you ask

259
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,600
participants about the prophecy concerns

260
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,729
they said they are not concerned because

261
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,080
they do not consider they did not

262
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,460
consider activity data sensitive

263
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,760
comparing comparing to other data such

264
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:27,070
as financial data rather they are mostly

265
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,500
concerned about self presentation and

266
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:34,080
social norms were sharing their data so

267
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,740
they said they make sure to boast

268
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,140
information that

269
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,529
confirm with sharing common sharing

270
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:45,640
norms and they do not share information

271
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:52,810
that might impact their image in front

272
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:56,620
of their peers so they make sure to post

273
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,719
something that can communicate positive

274
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,860
image about their health and with his

275
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,870
life all the few people had concerns

276
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:12,490
about reusing by their data merely by

277
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:14,980
insurers and by marketers we also asked

278
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,470
them what they do to manage their

279
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,820
prophecy and the most of them said that

280
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:27,670
they do not take any action to to manage

281
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:30,339
their information because again they do

282
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:34,660
not consider their this this data as

283
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:36,580
sensitive a few people mentioned that it

284
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,399
allows some strategies certain

285
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,470
techniques like providing minimal

286
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,040
information or providing fake

287
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,900
information in their profiles somewhere

288
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,360
was somewhere where we're not aware

289
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,990
about their privacy settings so we asked

290
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,060
them to go over their profiles and some

291
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,080
of them discovered that the other files

292
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:02,859
were actually public so in summary our

293
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,560
such our study suggests that users of

294
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,270
fitness trackers do not consider

295
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,810
activity data especially steep count as

296
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:13,050
sensitive as a result they do not take

297
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:17,229
any action to protect their information

298
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:20,099
however experimental research showed

299
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:25,089
that highly private information can be

300
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:27,459
can be draw it from activity data that

301
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:31,450
users generally consider less concerning

302
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:34,449
or less sensitive rather the disclosure

303
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:39,339
decisions are impacted by the benefits

304
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:41,980
such as the incentives or sharing with

305
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:44,440
doctors we've seen the measure of Milly

306
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,800
with the adductors for the sake of their

307
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,530
health and - they may disclose more

308
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,280
information to receive

309
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:55,930
incentives they are also there the

310
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,890
scores of decisions are also impacted by

311
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,810
social norms and audiences social norms

312
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,830
of the audience and the prod are our

313
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:08,680
platforms so based on our results we

314
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:12,490
recommend the set of design implications

315
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,969
first to design controls and features

316
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,700
around common goals and buttons so users

317
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:22,360
should be able to customize their

318
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:25,420
profiles based on and on the audience

319
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,600
and in their goals and features should

320
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,750
reflect common sharing norms there

321
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,170
should be also some methods to enable

322
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,510
users to connect their self tracking

323
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,439
data with their caregivers and finally

324
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,300
privacy not just tonnage users about

325
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,670
their sharing practices and to remind

326
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,849
them to revisit their controls from time

327
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,780
to time now I will leave you with this

328
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:55,240
set of sharing buttons that we found and

329
00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:02,890
if you have any question happy to answer

330
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:10,089
thank you if you have questions please

331
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:12,250
come to the microphone hey Dan cons like

332
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,159
Cornell and asset so I don't know if

333
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,440
there's gonna be so much a question as a

334
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,410
comment it'd be interesting to know how

335
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,880
people the part of decisions in

336
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,800
particular maybe wonder how the

337
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,690
recipients of this information thought

338
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,879
about the sharing cuz they're gonna sort

339
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,470
of work in the past about how doctors

340
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,420
may not really be able to make sense of

341
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,040
tracking data and so be really

342
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,790
interesting to see sort of the flip side

343
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,020
of this where you look not just at the

344
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,909
sharers but the people who they're

345
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,560
sharing to and sort of what kind of

346
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:46,030
responses and values they can give back

347
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:48,129
to people can you be the customer it's

348
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,710
not I said it's not a question I'm Koka

349
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,260
meant that you know you're talking about

350
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,450
the sharing but exclusively from the

351
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,770
sharers point of view right okay it

352
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,660
would be really interesting to

353
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,610
understand and this sort of contextual

354
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,860
integrity framework that you posed in

355
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,529
the paper

356
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,998
about sharing you know how recipients

357
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:08,009
point of view around the sharing and how

358
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,600
sort of the bigger interaction wins that

359
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,399
may have some real insight into the

360
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,418
kinds of controls and nudges that might

361
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:22,379
be yes interesting yes one of my future

362
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:28,409
plans is to study what study users and

363
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:30,149
doctors collaboration so I aim to you

364
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,899
know conduct user study with also

365
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:38,330
doctors to ask them about the reception

366
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:38,330
so this one of my blends so interesting

367
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:50,939
right now you know I get from Latrobe

368
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:53,009
University in Australia I say thanks for

369
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,429
the interesting talk I was wondering

370
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:57,659
about you talked about people when they

371
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:59,879
child informations actually they'd

372
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:02,519
really don't see the sensitivity notes

373
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:05,488
of that data shouting through all these

374
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,639
that the devices and were you able to

375
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:09,779
develop a kind of a threat model

376
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:13,229
understanding how the attackers could

377
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,909
leverage their tax through inviting a

378
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,379
previously of people its plaintiff

379
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:19,799
identify where the attackers couldn't

380
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:23,699
sneak into the systems through inviting

381
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:26,129
people surprise kind of things yeah I

382
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:31,950
did not think about this but I think yes

383
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:37,830
you're right if we like make some

384
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:41,909
experiment with users and telling them

385
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:44,428
that we will collect some personal data

386
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:48,090
from them they might be they might

387
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:52,109
reveal a different behavior so yeah this

388
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,269
is something interesting too I was that

389
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,970
a question for you so you talked a lot

390
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,529
about how what people's preferences and

391
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,710
considerations were in sharing data with

392
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:03,239
other people mm-hm and it was kind of

393
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,940
heartening to see that actually reason

394
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:07,139
about why they're sharing data and why

395
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,509
then what data they might not want to

396
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,639
share did you learn anything about how

397
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:15,379
they feel about the fitness tracking

398
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,379
companies having that data as well

399
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,629
did not examine the company's user

400
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,970
perception about their companies but

401
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,100
yeah some of them were concerned about

402
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,370
the marketers and about insurance

403
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:35,520
companies so these have some doubts that

404
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:38,668
their information might go to third

405
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,160
parties great thank you let's thank our

406
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:44,209
speaker

407
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,209
[Applause]
