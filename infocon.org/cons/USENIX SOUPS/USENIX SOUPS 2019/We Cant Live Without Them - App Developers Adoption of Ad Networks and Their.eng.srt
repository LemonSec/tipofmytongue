1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,900
so hello my name is Abraham Hyde Lee and

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,490
today I'll be talking about work I did

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,800
with my colleagues at University of

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,598
Michigan looking at how mobile app

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,200
developers and monetize their apps

6
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:27,419
through advertising so 50% of mobile

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,700
apps use ads and by extension

8
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:31,439
advertising networks for those who might

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,300
not know advertising networks are

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,579
companies that connect app developers

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,410
with advertisers so if I develop an app

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,140
and I want to put ads in it instead of

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,699
contacting like coca-cola directly to

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,830
have ads in my app I contact an

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,900
advertising network they contact the

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,180
advertisers and then the advertiser

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,940
network put ads into apps for me

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,180
examples include Google AdMob in mobi

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,030
and startup so for a brief overview of

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,800
how this process work let's take assume

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,010
we have a developer with a mobile app

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,438
they want to monetize they first use an

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,630
SDK provided by the advertising network

24
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,610
and then by integrating necessary lines

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,759
of code they say I want to put an ad

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,130
here then whenever an ordinary user uses

27
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,830
my app the ad network receives data from

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,408
the app such as the device user ID the

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,080
location etc and thus selectively

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,120
decides what specific ad to show that

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,759
specific user that specific moment in

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,890
time and though it seems like the ad

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,380
network is in charge of what ads appear

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,900
the developers can exercise can some

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,490
control they can show for example if

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,780
there are categories of ads that are

37
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,570
bands like maybe they don't want to show

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,640
car ads or apparel ads they can control

39
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,529
to some degree what data is sent to the

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,390
ad network so maybe they don't want to

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,250
send precise user location or the age

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,260
and gender of the user and they can even

43
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,369
choose whether to show targeted ads or

44
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:55,170
non targeted ads and ads are great

45
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,119
except this will be a pretty boring

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,270
presentation of they were and there are

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,250
many consumer risks that exist so first

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,020
many ad networks engage in targeted

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,060
advertising which requires pervasive

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,830
data collection raising privacy concerns

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,739
there are ads that have been known to

52
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,870
redirect users towards malware ads can

53
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,450
be creepy frustrating and annoying for

54
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,310
users as can lead to consumerism and the

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,798
sale of harmful products such as alcohol

56
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,739
gambling fast foods and a long long list

57
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,270
of Excellus and many proposals have been

58
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,950
put forward to manage the

59
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,600
consumer risks of advertising such as

60
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,670
technical systems that allow ad

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,710
targeting to occur locally on the user's

62
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,170
device and thus not send data to ad

63
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,580
networks but little is known about how

64
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,200
app developers reason about and

65
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,180
integrate ads which to me is key

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,310
knowledge to have if you want to solve a

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,930
problem as complicated as those posed by

68
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,090
advertising you need the perspective of

69
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,590
every stakeholder in the system and if

70
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,450
you're missing a key players such as app

71
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,750
developers then it's doubtful how

72
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,130
effective proposals will actually be so

73
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,710
we delved into the literature to see

74
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,210
what work had been done not surprising

75
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,620
there's been a lot of work detailing the

76
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,450
consumer risk of the advertising

77
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,910
networks the privacy security and other

78
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,040
risks with regards to developer

79
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,840
behaviors we looked at three key areas

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,640
information selection - seeking and

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,870
privacy and security behaviors regards

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,670
to information seeking and tool

83
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,800
selection one key theme is that

84
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,359
developers rely on their work

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,580
environment their colleagues their

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,500
professional friends to choose what

87
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,080
tools to use and how they look for

88
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,880
information and with regards to privacy

89
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,500
and security behaviors one common theme

90
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,990
is that developers often want to have

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,030
good privacy and security practices but

92
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,040
fail to do so for a variety of reasons

93
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,780
such as not understanding the privacy

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,150
policies of the third-party tools they

95
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,830
are using and most notably there's been

96
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,390
not a lot of work looking at advertising

97
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,430
networks specifically from the

98
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,380
perspective of app developers and how

99
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,709
app developers reason about and use ads

100
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,120
and so this is an area wanted to focus

101
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,560
on to better understand how app

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,420
developers reason about and integrate

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,520
acts and we had sort of four key areas

104
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,739
of focus that we took a sort of the

105
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,830
process by which an app developer put

106
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,690
ads into their app so first why do they

107
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,670
decide to use advertising in the first

108
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,959
place instead of charging a flat dollar

109
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,839
fee for the users or any other

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,370
monetization model how do they choose an

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,130
advertising network once they decide to

112
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,870
use advertising how do they configure

113
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,969
ads into their app once they've chosen

114
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,010
an advertising network and once the ads

115
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,220
are there how do they manage the

116
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,570
consumer risk that advertising poses to

117
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,340
do this we conducted a mixed-methods

118
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,860
study consisting of a survey and

119
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,570
interview component in the survey we

120
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,520
asked quantitative questions about the

121
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,930
app experience the advertising network

122
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,000
usage and general behaviors and

123
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,540
attitudes and in the interview we probed

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,380
in depth regarding the rash

125
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,180
sort of the why to these behaviors our

126
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,590
target population were app developers

127
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,600
who had monetized their apps through

128
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,760
advertising in the past we managed to

129
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,590
recruit 49 app developers for the survey

130
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,719
and ten for the interview given

131
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,729
difficulties in recruiting we were most

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,770
sample largely consisted of small

133
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,210
independent app developers and so we

134
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,890
carry all the findings by saying they

135
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,620
might not generalize to larger app

136
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,050
development companies so that's what we

137
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,210
did and now to move on to our findings

138
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,070
so to remind myself what we were looking

139
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,989
at our first question had to do with why

140
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,990
do developers choose to use advertising

141
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,910
in the first place

142
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,440
so not surprisingly advertising was key

143
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,520
to our participants I mean we were

144
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,710
recruiting people who'd worked with

145
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,240
advertising Google AdMob was the one

146
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,280
that was used the most and in fact for

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,990
40% of our participants advertising was

148
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,940
the only monetization model data ever

149
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,500
used and so when we asked why the

150
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,770
interviews gave a bit of nuance to this

151
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,600
in that ads were used because of a

152
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,820
necessity or rather a belief of

153
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,790
necessity app developers believed that

154
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,230
if they didn't use ants no one was gonna

155
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,640
pick up their app given that there's

156
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,590
gonna be another one next to it that's

157
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,810
exactly the same and free and so they

158
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,359
were not gonna make any money off of

159
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,520
their apps one interviewee put it in

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,200
dire terms if it wasn't for advertising

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,659
almost all the independent app

162
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,070
developers would basically just die thus

163
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,080
they feel they have to use advertising

164
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,340
and the key thing to know here is no no

165
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,349
they don't think advertising is like the

166
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,210
best model or like a good model they

167
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,010
think it is the only model so they're

168
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,690
almost resigned and like I have to use

169
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,719
advertising it's the only way I'm gonna

170
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,910
make money but this contrasted with the

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,110
fact that they're generally dissatisfied

172
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,300
with the amount of money that they get

173
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,740
from advertising in the interview all

174
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,030
the small independent app developers

175
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,160
kept complaining you know I'm not making

176
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,780
a lot of money the ad network is taking

177
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,550
a really large cut like I could have

178
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,950
thousands of users using my hat but like

179
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,510
I make so little money for per user that

180
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,960
I'm not really making a lot of money and

181
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,670
in the survey we asked participants did

182
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,039
you switch advertising networks while

183
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,470
working on an app and if so why all of

184
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,780
the ones who switched said that money

185
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,330
was a very or extremely important reason

186
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,530
for switching suggest in that

187
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,789
dissatisfaction with revenue Gong is

188
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,320
strong enough to like push people

189
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,720
towards another advertising network and

190
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,750
so we see this interesting paradox

191
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,940
between on the one hand

192
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,620
app developers saying advertising is the

193
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,540
only way to make money from apps and

194
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:01,010
actually you don't make money from

195
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,230
advertising in apps so a secondary focus

196
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,880
was how do app developers choose an

197
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,360
advertising network what factors do they

198
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,730
value how do they go about selecting one

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,430
so first we asked what resources they

200
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,770
use to pick an advertising network so to

201
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,990
briefly explain this graph the colored

202
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,880
parts in blue show the number of

203
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,620
participants who said that resource was

204
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,540
very or extremely important when

205
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,890
choosing an advertising network and here

206
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,780
the official website and online

207
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,610
discussion forums were very important

208
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,530
and followed by colleagues professional

209
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,570
networks and friends slightly different

210
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,159
from other literature that suggests that

211
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,990
colleagues professional network and

212
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
friends were most important and the

213
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,320
interviews gave some nuance to this

214
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,320
process and showed that developers do

215
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,760
not really put a lot of time and energy

216
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,730
researching what ad networks to use and

217
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,860
the process went something like this so

218
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,810
first there were rough heuristics used

219
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,550
to determine which ones to look at like

220
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,020
which one or two to look at stuff like

221
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,580
you know like I read it on a forum

222
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,890
somewhere or like I've heard Google

223
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,750
AdMob is like big and I cannot emphasize

224
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,460
how rough some of these heuristics were

225
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,290
more than one participants said

226
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,989
something along the lines of I'm making

227
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,850
apps for Android Google owns Android

228
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,550
therefore Google will clearly work the

229
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,290
best and then once it come up with this

230
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,210
like one or two advertising that wants

231
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,640
to look at they would go to the official

232
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,159
website if it looks ok and sort of not

233
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,870
sketchy they would try it and if it

234
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,669
worked they would stick with it and they

235
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,350
wouldn't really go much beyond that so

236
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,390
not a lot of work being put into

237
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,130
choosing an advertising network and the

238
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,960
important thing to note is that they

239
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,059
would rarely change the advertising

240
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,978
network even if there were problems and

241
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:37,010
only do so if it was completely broken

242
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,270
in our survey only 20% of our

243
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,740
participants had ever switch the

244
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,030
advertising networks and in our

245
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,469
interviews people kept saying you know

246
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,000
even though they had minor complaints

247
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,980
about revenue or minor complaints about

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,270
technical problems they were generally

249
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,430
once they picked an advertising network

250
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,250
stick with it and not really optimize

251
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,569
for money or for anything unless the

252
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,380
advertising network was completely

253
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,880
broken we also asked app developers you

254
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,070
know what do you value in an advertising

255
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,620
network what do you want and here at

256
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,450
developers claim to value user

257
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,060
security user satisfaction and user

258
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,680
privacy more so than even revenue now of

259
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,209
course they could be lying to us but in

260
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,099
the interviews there were many of

261
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,110
unprompted comments and unprompted

262
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,540
remarks such as you know I really want

263
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,950
to take care of my users or I chose this

264
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,449
because I don't like it when companies

265
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,520
do it to me so I'm not gonna do it to my

266
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,500
users which suggests that this care is

267
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,360
genuine so in the one hand it seems that

268
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,220
I've developers do value their users I

269
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,900
want good use of security satisfaction

270
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,080
and privacy but that's not the end of

271
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,670
the story in the survey we remember we

272
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,830
asked why did you switch advertising

273
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,050
networks and all the participants who

274
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,510
switch advertising networks did so for

275
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,370
money okay so this means that money is

276
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,020
actually more important and in the

277
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,730
interviews people kept bringing up ease

278
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,930
of integration saying you know I really

279
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,010
like this advertising network or I

280
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,199
wanted to choose this one because it

281
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,460
looked super easy to put into my app or

282
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,170
I didn't really like this one because it

283
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,110
was super hassle to get the ads working

284
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,420
so how can we explain these dissonant

285
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,070
findings we suspect there's an

286
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,689
underlying tension between on the one

287
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,250
hand developers really wanting better

288
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,660
use of security better using app

289
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,880
experience and respecting the user

290
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,319
privacy like that's what they want but

291
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,570
at the end of the day when it comes time

292
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,520
to putting ads in your app and like

293
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,410
renters do at the end of the month then

294
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,819
money and the ability to implement ads

295
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,860
easily those take precedence now - a

296
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,160
third question how do ad developers

297
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,720
configure the ads in their app and here

298
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,760
we saw that there was an overwhelming

299
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,680
default bias and participants would

300
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,630
generally stick to the default settings

301
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,250
provided now this in itself is not

302
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,140
surprising we all stick to default

303
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,270
settings but what is surprising is that

304
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,310
they stuck with these settings even when

305
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,990
in these settings went against their

306
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,670
wishes of like generating more revenue

307
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,890
or their wish to have privacy-preserving

308
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,050
apps and this led to some very

309
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,300
interesting contradictions so for

310
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,579
example one thing developers can choose

311
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,900
to do is to some degree what data is

312
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,580
sent to the ad network and they can

313
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,980
choose to send you know like precise

314
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,450
location age and gender they users etc

315
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,160
and developers didn't really do that

316
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,870
they just stuck with the bare minimum

317
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,819
and wouldn't go out of their way to send

318
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,580
more data to the advertising network and

319
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,890
we asked and the idea is presumably the

320
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,450
more data you send the better targeting

321
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,760
the ad network can do and so the more

322
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,230
money you seek to earn and so when we

323
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,740
asked why don't you send more data they

324
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,430
were like oh we want to preserve the

325
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,959
we see other users which is fine however

326
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,089
another thing developers can choose is

327
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,459
whether to show targeted or non targeted

328
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,500
ads the default is to show targeted ads

329
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,630
so developers will show targeted ads and

330
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,980
when we asked why they said oh we chose

331
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,529
targeted ads because we want to make

332
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,750
more money but if you want to make more

333
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,550
money why aren't you sending the more

334
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,980
data which will lead to better targeting

335
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,410
and so have more money for you and thus

336
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,910
we see that like these even though I try

337
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,870
to rationalize it by having you know I

338
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,579
want more money or I want

339
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,170
privacy-preserving apps they're really

340
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,490
just sticking to the default settings

341
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,899
even when these contradict each other

342
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,790
and when it doesn't work in their

343
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:58,080
interests so it's very interesting

344
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:00,180
default bias that exists and lastly how

345
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,130
do app developers manage the consumer

346
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,770
risks that advertising poses and the

347
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,600
short answer is they really don't namely

348
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,579
because they view it as the advertising

349
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,959
that was responsibility for fixing the

350
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,250
consumer risks in a survey 50% of those

351
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,109
surveyed said that ad networks were

352
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,240
completely responsible for fixing the

353
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,980
consumer risks versus only two people

354
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
who set up developers and for people who

355
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,089
said like a government agency such as

356
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,589
the FTC and in the interview they shed

357
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,570
some light over why this was the case

358
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,430
and they expressed sort of on the one

359
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,350
hand very little agency like there's not

360
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,569
much that they could do and on the

361
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,980
second responsibility ad networks were

362
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,540
the one who put ads in why do I have to

363
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,790
worry about it let them deal with it and

364
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,230
so they did very little in terms of

365
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,140
monitoring their apps are proactively

366
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:48,060
trying to say manage mitigate the

367
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:49,920
consumer risks of advertising thus to

368
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,719
summarize our findings app developer

369
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,760
mobile app developers use advertising

370
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,579
mostly out of resignation and a belief

371
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,480
that like they have to use advertising

372
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:59,579
they don't spend too much time

373
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,550
researching what advertising network to

374
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:05,040
use they stick to default settings even

375
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,910
when it goes against their financial or

376
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,160
privacy-preserving

377
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,170
interests and they believe it is not

378
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,640
their responsibility to fix issues with

379
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,469
advertising networks viewing themselves

380
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,839
as having little agency and they'd like

381
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,950
little responsibility and so looking at

382
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,930
these findings we saw several

383
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,260
opportunities for future work for

384
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,939
intervention so the first is to better

385
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,709
support developers in choosing app

386
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,970
monetization models so we saw this

387
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,709
interesting paradox between on the one

388
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,720
hand developers saying advertising is

389
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:32,339
the only way to make money from apps and

390
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,290
you don't make money from advertising

391
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,269
and apps which suggests that maybe the

392
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,730
conventional wisdom that advertising is

393
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:42,540
the best and only way to monetize your

394
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,820
apps is wrong and so more information on

395
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,589
what monetization models work in what

396
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,690
circumstances and for what apps is

397
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,730
needed and this information needs to be

398
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,310
presented loud and clear to developers

399
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,440
we imagine a website maybe where an app

400
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,239
developer good go on say I want to

401
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,430
create app X with these characteristics

402
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,279
and the website would spit back you know

403
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,109
use monetization model Y or maybe you

404
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,000
know have a table with the pros and cons

405
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,529
of different monetization models not

406
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,240
only would this help developers make

407
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,430
more informed more profitable decisions

408
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,139
over what monetization model to use but

409
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,510
perhaps it could encourage app

410
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,160
developers to pick monetization models

411
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,720
that they wouldn't have otherwise and

412
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,279
maybe move away from advertising and

413
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,110
away from the consumer risks that

414
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:26,519
advertising poses second area future

415
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,529
work could be to be thinking the ad

416
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,300
network default so we saw app developers

417
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,800
had an overwhelming default bias and

418
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,839
will generally stick with the default

419
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,060
settings given that some of these

420
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,430
settings were directly tied to consumer

421
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,290
risks maybe we could mandate that ad

422
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,959
networks change their defaults to have

423
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,269
consumer friendly settings maybe the

424
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,560
bare minimum needed of data needed to be

425
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,370
sent to the ad network could be kept

426
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,449
even lower maybe certain categories of

427
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,730
products such as you know fast food

428
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,709
gambling alcohol could be blocked by

429
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,810
default maybe the default could be

430
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,939
having non-targeted instead of targeted

431
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,768
ads so changing these defaults could go

432
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,839
a long way in changing the way ads are

433
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:06,269
set up in apps and thus could have a

434
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,220
huge impact on the consumer risks or the

435
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,350
prevalence of these consumer risks and

436
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,880
in fact in there's now a lot of debate

437
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,220
and contention in Europe of through the

438
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,120
GDP of actually deciding what these

439
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,220
settings should be and lastly we

440
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,860
advocate sort of encouraging developer

441
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,839
responsibility so we saw that developers

442
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,949
you know said you know not my problem

443
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,620
and I can't really do much about

444
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:30,959
problems with advertising leave it to

445
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,910
the advertising networks and this might

446
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,469
seem true at first you know developers a

447
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,029
small fish in the pond and advertising

448
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,139
there were some big large companies and

449
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,149
they are the ones who in charge of

450
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,800
advertising but there are little things

451
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:42,689
that developers can do right there are

452
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,240
ways they can configure their apps to

453
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:46,099
control what data said to

454
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,290
advertising it what categories about to

455
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,550
show little things like that there are

456
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,199
the ones who choose to use advertising

457
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,939
in the first place and choose to use ad

458
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,649
networks and they can even be you know

459
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,870
as part of that ecosystem they can

460
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,810
affect change and maybe even have more

461
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,089
collective action or small joint action

462
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,859
together and so we advocate encouraging

463
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,390
developer responsibility but a special

464
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,430
form of responsibility positive

465
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,110
responsibility usually when we talk

466
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,640
about responsibility we talk about blame

467
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,529
right advertising networks are in charge

468
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,120
of ads ads are bad therefore blame the

469
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:15,529
advertising network and we don't want to

470
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,730
do that to developers what we want to do

471
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,890
is sort of encourage dispositive

472
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,260
responsibility that acknowledges that

473
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:24,170
we're all in this advertising ecosystem

474
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,520
together app developers advertising

475
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,189
networks and consumers and it's all on

476
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,839
us to try to make advertising as good

477
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,700
and try to mitigate the problems of

478
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,230
advertising as much as possible and so

479
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,120
we want to like encourage this sort of

480
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,740
thinking this sort of thinking can be

481
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,390
encouraged in classes and app

482
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,310
development tutorials and modules or

483
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,140
even when the advertising network is

484
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,300
sort of given its tutorial on how to use

485
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,250
its SDK it could have specific sections

486
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,109
about consumer risks and what developers

487
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,000
can do to mitigate them or maybe

488
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,339
incentives can be offered to developers

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,620
maybe developers who proactively show

490
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,390
consumer friendly practices can receive

491
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,730
like a token like sort of free trade

492
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,189
token type thing letting consumers know

493
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,839
that they actually are using consumer

494
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,530
the developers are trying to enact

495
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,630
consumer friendly practices thus in

496
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,459
conclusion mobile app developers use

497
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,170
advertising out of resignation and

498
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,150
belief of necessity suggestion that

499
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,100
maybe more accurate information about

500
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,260
what monetization models work under what

501
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,969
circumstances is needed they

502
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,949
overwhelmingly stick with default bias

503
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,300
suggesting that maybe one area of

504
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,429
intervention could be mandatory

505
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,948
mandating and digitizing networks to

506
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,120
have consumer friendly defaults and they

507
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,800
think it is the ad networks

508
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,600
responsibility to manage to consumer

509
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,129
risk suggesting that maybe we should

510
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,290
encourage positive responsibility

511
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,020
through the classes or incentives for

512
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:46,730
app developers thank you

513
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:46,730
[Applause]

514
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,630
hi I'm Corey fat Glarus I'm from

515
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,670
Carnegie Mellon University thank you so

516
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,100
much for this great work I think we

517
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,780
definitely have a lot more challenges

518
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,100
ahead across the internet for

519
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:09,160
advertising challenges but one one

520
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,260
comment I have is I actually like

521
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,320
advertising maybe I'm the weirdo in the

522
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,600
room but I love that it saves me time

523
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,510
and finding other apps to download or

524
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,800
things to buy but I definitely don't

525
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,330
like ad networks do you see in your

526
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,300
research and this might be out of scope

527
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,840
are there any alternatives to using ad

528
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,340
networks such as sourcing individual ads

529
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,570
to display you mean

530
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,540
alternatives for ad networks for

531
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,970
displaying ads yeah I mean say I'm a

532
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,250
independent app developer and I just

533
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,620
want to make back at least as much money

534
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,410
as I have to pay for my developer

535
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,830
license do you see in your study where

536
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,500
is there anybody individually recruiting

537
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,480
advertisers no everyone stuck with

538
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,180
advertising networks and in fact even

539
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,620
like I said our sample was largely small

540
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,630
independent app developers but we did

541
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,770
manage to get some people working in

542
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,050
large companies and even they used

543
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,030
advertising networks it seems like you

544
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,950
could have you wanted to contact app

545
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,930
like specific companies and be like

546
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,600
advertising my work but I think for a

547
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,100
lot of app developers like they just

548
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
wanted ads in their app to work they

549
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,340
didn't want to like go out of their way

550
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,870
they didn't want to spend a lot of time

551
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,699
putting advertising into their apps I

552
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,870
just wanted something that worked and so

553
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,230
advertising networks are just so

554
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,219
convenient for them that they there are

555
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,620
other options that could theoretically

556
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,600
exist but they don't use them have you

557
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,770
had a chance to get any feedback on your

558
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,090
work from these ad networks I have not

559
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,940
not yet this is the first time

560
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,280
presenting this work I'd love to see

561
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,490
them take up your recommendations me too

562
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,840
but listen thank you actually for our

563
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,890
next speaker what a mind just coming up

564
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,919
and steering setup hello Jeffrey

565
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,540
Goldberg from 1password I'm wondering

566
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,860
if you've looked at any of the

567
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,899
literature in behavioral economics and

568
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,229
behavioral decision-making because what

569
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm seeing in your discrepancy between

570
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:10,860
revealed preferences and defaults or

571
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:15,540
reference points is the kind of thing

572
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:18,419
that behavioral economists look at quite

573
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,970
a bit as they do also at satisficing

574
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,100
finding the first working solution and

575
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,020
so I'm just recommending that literature

576
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,639
broadly thank you yeah we looked a

577
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,730
little bit we could definitely look more

578
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:36,390
into that literature

579
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:42,510
heydon't Cosley Cornell and NSF really

580
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:43,680
useful for doing some of the things um

581
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,870
could you say that again I didn't quite

582
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,200
hear oh sorry I guess I was too far from

583
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,850
the mic uh do you have thought did

584
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,100
anyone talk about where they got this

585
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,929
belief of necessity from right was it

586
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,760
just from looking at that ecosystem or

587
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,500
did they get that from the forums too

588
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,550
cuz that'd be really useful for thinking

589
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,310
about how to structure these

590
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,379
recommenders for monetization models and

591
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,659
stuff it was a combination of both like

592
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,710
informal like so the rough heuristics

593
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,060
used in advertising that was were

594
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,130
similar like rough heuristics like oh

595
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,210
yeah like I read in forum somewhere that

596
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,500
like you know advertising is you don't

597
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,060
want to make it and I think also

598
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,760
personal experience played a bigger role

599
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,050
like I said oh I wouldn't pay for an app

600
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,300
therefore no one in the world is gonna

601
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,159
pay for an app so I think they both use

602
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,450
these refus'd six on their own personal

603
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,860
experience so actually I had a quick

604
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,120
question um I'm kind of curious about

605
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,500
how you managed to recruit app

606
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,760
developers to begin with I know a lot of

607
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,170
people have been trying to do that and

608
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,870
it could be a challenging thing yeah I'm

609
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,670
very with a lot of difficulties so at

610
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,320
first I thought you know I'll just post

611
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,610
it and read it like one of the subreddit

612
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,590
for Android development and it'll be

613
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,570
fine and then I got no responses and

614
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,000
then I posted in more subreddits then I

615
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,250
posted in sort of like Facebook groups

616
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,140
then I went to app developer meetups

617
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,580
then I like you know got people's

618
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,920
information from the App Store and

619
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,419
started contacting them directly and I

620
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,560
think that proved the most effective

621
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,600
sort of like going to the App Store

622
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,429
seeing app developers like emails are

623
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,199
like pinging them and be like hey do you

624
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,809
want to take part in this study that was

625
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,639
the most effective but that might be why

626
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,649
I mostly got independent app developers

627
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,969
since independent app developers it's

628
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,658
like their email and they're more likely

629
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,009
to check it

630
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,659
whereas for larger app development

631
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,950
companies it goes to like sort of

632
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,620
customer support and they just like to

633
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,779
throw it away so a lot of difficulties

634
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,248
I'd be happy to talk more about the

635
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,249
different methods offline also

636
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,220
[Applause]
