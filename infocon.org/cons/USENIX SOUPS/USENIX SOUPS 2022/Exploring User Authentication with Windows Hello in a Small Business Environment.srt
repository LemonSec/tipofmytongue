1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,639
and I have the pleasure to present joint

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,000
work with Leona Janis and Marcus

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,820
and in our study we have observed the

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,640
transition from password-based logins to

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,619
a new authentication approach in the

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,800
company

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,539
so over the course of more than two

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,519
decades a lot of effort has been put

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
into the quest to replace passwords and

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,540
lighten the burden for people

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,780
authentication with computers

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,040
lots of different approaches have been

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,219
developed and studied over the years

15
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:42,960
some of them like for instance graphical

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
passwords or security tokens have found

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,660
their way into Real World Systems

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,079
and the with developments like 502 the

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,000
broader availability of built-in

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,379
security modules and biometry sensors

21
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:01,199
robust alternatives are to

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,180
password-based authentication I attend

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,619
especially biometric authentication

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,560
became very popular and usable in the

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,600
usable alternative to passwords or

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,240
mobile devices

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,340
um but what about authentication in a

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,500
work environment what authentication

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,380
methods do people prefer to use their at

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,900
their work computers

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,000
does biometric authentication also works

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
here

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,220
so we in our study we explored whether

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,820
employees are willing to adopt biometric

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,880
authentication method or not

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,979
specifically we were interested in the

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,400
following while or why not do employees

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,100
adopt a biometric based authentication

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,500
method

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,140
um which variant they consider to be

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,180
most secure when choosing between facial

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,280
recognition authentication by

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,340
fingerprint or passwords

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,280
and finally we were also interested to

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,920
compare the user experience of the alt

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,700
and new approach

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,919
um yeah we had the opportunity to do a

48
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,080
study

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,000
to study the transition from traditional

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,220
Windows login with passwords or smart

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,020
cards to Windows hello in a small

52
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,200
company with roughly 40 employees

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,379
um we invent invited all 15 employees

54
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,840
who were regularly using a computer

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720
during their work to participate in our

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,319
study and 13 of them took part and

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,319
completed our study

58
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,000
participants were allowed to use

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,040
different authentication methods during

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,080
the study survey as I mentioned before

61
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,420
they could choose between a facial or

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,299
fingerprint recognition or pins

63
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,920
besides having a revert scenario this

64
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,620
company was very um yeah was very

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,540
interesting environment because they had

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,720
different workplaces or spaces in which

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,780
people log in or unlock their computers

68
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,019
so we had the typical office environment

69
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,300
where each employee had their own

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,180
computer we had some people working in a

71
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,920
production setting with shared computers

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,580
and also people that were traveling or

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,099
had meetings with their customers and

74
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,560
yeah so that they sometimes need to

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,379
authenticate in public places or in

76
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,159
front of other people

77
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,340
so our study started with a 50-minute

78
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,340
meeting with all eligible employees in

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,980
which we explained our study and also

80
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,340
the conditions of participation and

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,260
asked them whether they want to

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,159
participate or not

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,379
um after the meeting we started to

84
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,360
collect collect authentication timings

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
for all

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,500
participants with the old windows login

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,120
method

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,060
um for one week so that we had some data

89
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,120
that we could later compare to the new

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,420
method and see if it's faster or slower

91
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,060
um yeah after that we did the same with

92
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,340
the new windows hello authentication

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,000
method but for four weeks so that the

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,760
participants had the chance to somewhat

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,579
familiarize with the new methods

96
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,019
um and after

97
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,139
um and after each of these two phases

98
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,540
um we let the participant fill out a

99
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,060
user experience questionnaire so that

100
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,880
they can assess their experience with

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,820
the new and the old login method

102
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,259
finally we had a 15-minute interview

103
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,840
with each participant to get more in

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,180
in-depth feedback on the experience with

105
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,600
Windows handle and also to debrief them

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,820
from our study

107
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,220
okay let's talk about some of our

108
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,080
results

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,240
so in summary all participants really

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,460
liked using Windows hello and they

111
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,740
stated they don't want to go back to the

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,040
old password-based login method they

113
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,199
really appreciated that they had to type

114
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,259
less and having a faster authentication

115
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,380
process in general

116
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,660
however

117
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,520
except for two participants most

118
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
participants

119
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,919
used pins almost for the entirety of the

120
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,300
study and for us it was a little bit of

121
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,460
a surprise because we expected that the

122
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,860
adoption rate for authentication would

123
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,280
be a little bit higher yeah seeing the

124
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,500
the results on mobile Authentication

125
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,340
um the interviews revealed some of the

126
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,460
reasons for for not using biometry and

127
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,280
these are ranging from

128
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,500
privacy related issues uh like feeling

129
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,199
being observed by the facial recognition

130
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,020
camera or mistrusting biometry Hardware

131
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,020
in general to the fear of being locked

132
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,360
out from from their accounts if the

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,940
sensors sensor breaks

134
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,699
also people did not use biometry when

135
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,560
the sensor was not directly accessible

136
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,620
like in the case of a laptop with a

137
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,660
closed lid so that the lid is covering

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,000
the camera or the fingerprint reader

139
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,860
um to work properly if uh facial

140
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,539
recognition in Minnesota requires that

141
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,580
the person is looking directly into the

142
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,039
camera and having their face close to it

143
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,600
and

144
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,199
um

145
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,419
yeah after the authentication the the

146
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,000
camera is turned off but uh people still

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,120
uh still might feel observed by the mere

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,180
presence of this camera and uh yeah that

149
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,880
was also commented by by participant 10

150
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,300
as you can see here on the slide

151
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,220
on the other hand participants were not

152
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,199
sure how reliable biometric

153
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,660
authentication is working under certain

154
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,240
conditions

155
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,699
so where the facial recognition still

156
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,380
work if they exchange their appearance

157
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,960
like shaving the beard or wearing

158
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,220
glasses

159
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,380
or will a fingerprint reader work if the

160
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,900
fingers they use for authentication get

161
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,280
injured

162
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,419
usually for this type of cases a pin is

163
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,259
set as a fallback and so also get that

164
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,960
the people can still authenticate but if

165
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,020
people do not use the pin frequently

166
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,000
they might forget it and

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,039
um yeah get still locked out from the

168
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,219
account

169
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,319
however an even bigger impact might have

170
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,479
been the fact that most participants in

171
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,280
our study use laptops of a docking

172
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,039
station and yeah participants stated

173
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,259
that their locking station their their

174
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,740
laptop sit in a docking station and uh

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,039
with the lid closed most of the time so

176
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,919
the biometry sensors were covered by the

177
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,979
lid and making it inconvenient compared

178
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,620
to this to the pins or they use the pin

179
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,039
instead

180
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
and even when the lid was not closed

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,080
participant might

182
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,060
authenticate sorry participants might

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,460
not authenticate successfully because of

184
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,680
the laptop was on the other side of the

185
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,500
desk sitting in the talking station and

186
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,680
that's what was too far away so that

187
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,479
they don't get recognized by the facial

188
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,479
recognition camera or to reach the

189
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,280
fingerprint reader easily

190
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,780
another factor for adapting or not

191
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,180
adopting biometry based authentication

192
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,599
might be the perceived security of the

193
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,039
different efforts

194
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,099
so when we ask the participants in the

195
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,320
interview which of the authentication

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,559
methods of this well from the study were

197
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,380
the most secure we've got kind of mixed

198
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,399
results

199
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,100
so some participants stated that facial

200
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,140
recognition has to be the most secure

201
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,600
variant

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,480
because it seems such a complex method

203
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,220
and we're leaving many features from a

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,480
person's face

205
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,420
others said that fingerprint readers I

206
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,220
or fingerprints are used in documents

207
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,100
like passports or ID cards so they have

208
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,500
to be very secure

209
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,260
on the other hand other people were more

210
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,040
skeptical about biometry in general

211
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,300
saying that they don't fully trust the

212
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,480
technology and coming up with their own

213
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,580
long password might be even more secure

214
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,560
than using a biometry based

215
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,200
Authentication

216
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,279
okay

217
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,339
so let's now jump into another part of

218
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,399
our results so the comparison of the

219
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,700
user experience

220
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,959
so starting with the authentication

221
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,100
speeds even with most that even then

222
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,180
most participants in our study uses pins

223
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,220
the the Locking time was still much

224
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,720
faster than with the traditional

225
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,820
password-based authentication so as you

226
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,860
can see

227
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,500
it's almost twice as fast in in on

228
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,680
average so compare the three

229
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,260
so on over on average three seconds for

230
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,860
Windows hello and almost

231
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,700
5.7 seconds for the traditional login

232
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,100
and

233
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,660
participants also perceived this as a

234
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,779
it's faster so um when we ask them in

235
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,300
the interview to to say which method was

236
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,700
faster and why participants replied that

237
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,519
Windows hello is faster because the pins

238
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,440
they used were shorter and less complex

239
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,260
so this reduced complexity also these

240
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,600
two leads to less errors and extra

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,540
authentication process less annoying to

242
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,720
them

243
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,880
and to compare the the results of the

244
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,399
user experience questionnaire

245
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,760
um yeah the the results of these also

246
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,339
confirms this positive uh attitude

247
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,700
towards the new authentication method

248
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,880
as you can see uh on the

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,019
on each scale for for the from the user

250
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,440
authentic user experience questionnaire

251
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,160
um

252
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,880
for Windows hello here in green there

253
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,560
for all scales the results were

254
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,540
significantly higher than for the old

255
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,959
version for the old windows login

256
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,200
and um yeah to highlight some some of

257
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,339
these results

258
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,800
um Windows hello seems to be too too

259
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,940
much of

260
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,459
um seems to offer much clearer and more

261
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,800
efficient way to authenticate on the

262
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,339
Windows computer

263
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,800
all right let's add my presentation

264
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,200
so what we've learned from a study is

265
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,940
that deploying hardware and software for

266
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,920
biometry based authentication and work

267
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,200
environment might not be enough so that

268
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,500
employees start to adopt these biometric

269
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,120
methods

270
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,339
employees might have valid reasons to

271
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,860
not use fingerprint readers or facial

272
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,100
recognition probably the workspace setup

273
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,019
does not allow easy access to the

274
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,820
biometry sensor or external

275
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,980
circumstances like the requirement to

276
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,839
wear protective clothing render

277
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,500
spirometry unusable

278
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,540
and especially in the case of facial

279
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,860
recognition employees may have

280
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,019
reservation then a camera for

281
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,140
authentication are installed in their

282
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,000
workplaces

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,160
depending on the company culture

284
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,800
employees May decline such an idea as

285
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
there have been reports on companies

286
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,300
using biometric hardware for employee

287
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,779
surveillance

288
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
yeah and that's that's it so thank you

289
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,040
and I'm happy to take your questions
