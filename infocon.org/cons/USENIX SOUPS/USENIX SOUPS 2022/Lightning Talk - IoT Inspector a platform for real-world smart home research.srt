1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,160
good morning everybody

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,840
my name is Danny Huang assistant

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,780
professor at New York University

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,119
we're part of a team that developed iot

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,180
inspector so here's um the motivation so

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,680
basically we're living a smart home

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,539
these days we're surrounded by smart

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,939
devices smart cameras smart Voice

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,820
Assistant Smart TVs smart toilets

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,759
whatnot and many users living in such

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,880
situations they are just concerned

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,340
number one who their device is talking

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,379
to what companies what countries are

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,360
they advertisers are there malicious

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,399
parties accessing their camera fees

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,340
their baby monitors so right now

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,559
um they aren't very good uh or many

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,780
usable tools for a user like what

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,300
Wireshark TCB dump so because of this

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,000
issue in 2019 we built this tool called

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,480
iot inspector that turns all of this

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,220
smart devices into dashboards

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,140
graphs tables visualizations that tell

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,479
users basically what's going on behind

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,920
the scene in the home network with just

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,020
a few clicks basically you know users

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,820
don't have to download anything I don't

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,920
have to install any special Hardware

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
devices no cables no browser settings

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
and then boom with the software users

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,460
can basically see what's going on in

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,979
their homes so um

33
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,799
in the past three years we have about 6

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,080
000 users installing and using this

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,500
particular iot inspector that includes a

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,200
journalist from NPR Washington Post who

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
wrote who used this tool to uh basically

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,900
um find out more about Smart TV privacy

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,299
so that's the current state and also

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,140
we're working we're working with

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,960
Consumer Reports right now to expand the

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
scope to go beyond 6 400 people to

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
potentially more users more smart home

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,280
users from from all around the world so

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,759
that's the current state of this project

46
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,780
turning smart home devices into graphs

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,140
visualizations for users at this point

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,880
that's the current state

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,280
so 6 000 users

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
what can we do with this

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,739
well for users it's a usable tool but

52
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,020
for researchers we are building a

53
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,400
platform

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,440
a platform that basically does two

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,780
things what prolific does and what

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,120
imagenet does

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
so for users yes we're going to continue

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,379
making software better and better are we

59
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,239
going to be uh providing useful

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,920
information for them so that users can

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,360
not only see what's going on in the

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,160
network and number two potentially block

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,920
what's going on so that's for users

64
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,980
and at the same time users by the way

65
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,560
these are unpaid users users can

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,019
contribute contribute Anonymous data to

67
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,959
us the researchers

68
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,519
and because we are sitting on this large

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,620
data set we can do what prolific does

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,780
and what imagenet does

71
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,459
right now we have projects where

72
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,519
researchers can use our platform of uh

73
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,680
uh uh

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,959
iot inspector this deployed from all

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,760
around the world to run experiments

76
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,580
we've had experiments about building

77
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,379
firewall rules we have experiments about

78
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,300
the understanding a securing privacy

79
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,860
concerns in homes

80
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,739
and there are more and I invite the

81
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,379
community to talk to us to potentially

82
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,180
run more experiments for example we have

83
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,800
I just talked to another person

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,739
yesterday about uh uh

85
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,260
user configurations in a smart home they

86
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,840
were basically concerned about how users

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,400
configure their Smart Homes how users

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,080
configure their smart devices is it safe

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,959
or not yes on one hand we could ask

90
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,060
users through surveys but on the other

91
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,580
hand can we complement survey data by

92
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,819
basically looking really into their

93
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,299
smart home network and at the same time

94
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,819
uh ask them within the iot inspector app

95
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,980
you know so in that way we have a

96
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,440
correspondence between what user says in

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,959
our app what users claims itself reports

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,299
versus what actually happens on the home

99
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,080
network so you know our prolific

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,599
uh will be for a smart home users handle

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,819
and we'll be able to see what's going on

102
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,799
in a home network what's actually going

103
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,680
on versus what they claim to do so we

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,478
can establish relationship between you

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,399
know say for example their awareness

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,040
their concerns their attitudes their

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,080
actions versus what's going on so that's

108
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,660
the sort of prolific model where we're

109
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,520
trying to achieve

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,040
and then there's the imagenet model

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
because we're basically what we're doing

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,940
here is gathering large-scale label data

113
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,979
label not just Network traffic but

114
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,979
labels labels of devices and also in

115
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,560
future labels of what users are doing

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
with their home network uh smart devices

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,080
for example users can label hey this is

118
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,660
me updating my camera or that is me

119
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,479
actually using a camera so that gives

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,340
researchers and insight into what

121
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,139
otherwise would have been just encrypted

122
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,180
traffic encrypted headers so that users

123
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,160
can researchers can say that hey if

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
camera talks to company X on this domain

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,840
with Y packets per second maybe the

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,400
camera is doing something like that or

127
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
you know maybe camera streaming video or

128
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,520
something so anyways we're building

129
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,199
prolific and image net for Smart Homes

130
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,540
happy to talk offline about this and

131
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,900
thank you
