1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,500
ERS azerine really should be here today

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,719
presenting the paper but unfortunately

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,400
there's a bit of a backlog for getting

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,320
visas right now so she couldn't attend

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,600
so I'm afraid you've got me today

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,199
presenting

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,939
so I think one of the more interesting

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,880
kind of developments

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,320
in soups has been this kind of recent

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
interest in not just hacking but also

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,120
trying to understand

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,219
what it is to be a victim of hacking and

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,739
this is of course particularly urgent in

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,200
cases of stalking and intimate partner

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,579
of violence

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,680
um but I think more broadly there's just

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
a kind of a kind of refocus on the the

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,260
the user's perspective in this this

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,739
these quite kind of harrowing cases now

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,320
for many victims of hacking

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,000
um one of the challenges is that they

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,739
actually are not aware of that they are

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,040
victims and so we've seen this kind of

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,619
um uh kind of efforts to kind of have

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,600
disclosure and such when there's a kind

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,400
of hacking instance so that

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,780
um those who might be unaware that

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,280
they're they've been hacked or actually

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,979
actually informed but in our work in

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,560
this paper we actually explore perhaps a

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,119
slightly different Group which is those

33
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,240
who are unsure victims and that is to

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,259
see

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,460
um victims who suffer many of the

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,619
consequences of being hacked but are

37
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,600
actually unsure if they have actually

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,820
been hacked at all and even in some

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,740
cases it would appear that they perhaps

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,500
haven't been hacked and this I think

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,020
um reminds us of that kind of um a

42
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,060
well-known adage that things imagined

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,920
are real in their consequences

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,540
now um the the main focus of our paper

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,119
is on these user experiences of being

46
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,360
hacked and we we use data from online

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
postings self-reports of of people being

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,399
hacked in in different ways and we

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,500
focused in particular on Internet of

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,079
Things smart home technology in part

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,179
because these devices can be so

52
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,459
inscrutable and they can lead lots of

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,379
challenges to try and understand whether

54
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,640
you've been hacked or not when you're

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
when you when you have unusual events

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,340
that happen with these these devices

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,959
um it's important we should emphasize

58
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,260
that our kind of definition was that

59
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,540
kind of user Centric one in that it was

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,280
like the case where users themselves

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
were deciding that they'd been hacked we

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,819
didn't add our own criteria on top of it

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,739
but it was to look at accounts when

64
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,420
users themselves were making that

65
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,640
decision

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,099
um so we ended up with about 210 hack

67
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,080
reports and we have a diverse set of

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,819
places that we took them from different

69
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,760
online discussion for our Reddit was

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,040
kind of about half of the the posts that

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
we we took from there

72
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,940
um uh somewhere from from Amazon product

73
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,160
reviews where reviewers talked about

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,900
being hacked in use of a particular

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,640
device and then we had

76
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,379
um another set of contributions from

77
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,480
product support forums where users were

78
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,580
discussing being hacked in in different

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,800
ways

80
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,620
now what goes into a hack report well

81
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,599
well of course clearly there's some sort

82
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,280
of description of the technology story

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,920
of what happened actions taken by the

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,500
user to deal with the hack

85
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,420
but one of the challenges users have

86
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,980
when they're reporting on a hack is a

87
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,739
hack is quite an exceptional event so

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,239
they need to go to some length to

89
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,739
actually justify

90
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,959
you know why why why is this actually a

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,940
hack and then justify that you know I

92
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,260
know this sounds a bit exceptional but I

93
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,940
was actually was that was actually

94
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,760
hacked and what's ever present in these

95
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
uh accounts is this doubt and

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,540
questioning about whether you know

97
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,519
whether the user was actually hacked or

98
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,319
not and indeed

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,000
um

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,920
oops sorry I need to

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
curl this I think go back

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
there I'm sorry

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,540
um

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
one is one of the uh as one of the

105
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
um

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,940
you know it's one of our kind of posters

107
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,340
kind of described it when they're hacked

108
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,980
it was a kind of question of is a cat is

109
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,519
a ghost or was it actually a hack

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,860
now of course there's kind of variety in

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,480
these kind of reports as well so we had

112
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,699
some that were kind of warnings so this

113
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,500
is a case where

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,660
um one poster says you know it was the

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,639
best camera so it was compromised but

116
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,979
sure enough last night about 9pm I

117
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,540
watched it move five degrees to the left

118
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,580
and then back to the right strongly urge

119
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,080
you not to buy this camera because if

120
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,360
one is compromised then most likely

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,340
their system is too

122
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,720
or you might get these ones which are

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,180
more kind of calls for for help

124
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,400
um my Chromecast was hacked and turns my

125
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,380
TV on with creepy short video clips what

126
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,720
is going on I called the police and the

127
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Arizona attorney general

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,259
or you might have ones that are also

129
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,060
more about kind of initiating discussion

130
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,240
in some way this one uh as a participant

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,000
talks about 10 minutes uh go my camera

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,199
in the kitchen started making

133
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,360
pornographic sounds to its speaker it

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,699
lasted about 30 seconds just before the

135
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,320
event my Google home speaker made the

136
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
blip noises someone that just triggered

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
it

138
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,120
um did anyone else experience this

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,919
surely I'm not the only one

140
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,259
now when a user is is hacked they have

141
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,840
to kind of try and make sense of the Hat

142
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,940
in some way

143
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,380
um they have to ask this question look

144
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,199
have I actually been hacked and

145
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,520
um one of the kind of ways of doing this

146
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,160
is to look for unusual behavior so for

147
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,180
example

148
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,680
um devices sometimes will just you know

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,780
if there's an iot device it'll often

150
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,340
have some kind of flashing lights on it

151
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,660
and then

152
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,820
unusual behavior with flashing lights

153
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,100
can for some users be seen as evidence

154
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,500
of well maybe I've been hacked in some

155
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,539
way

156
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,199
um

157
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,820
then they have to kind of question and

158
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,500
think you know well you know there's one

159
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
thing about have I been hacked but then

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,919
you know the next question is like who's

161
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,300
hacked me

162
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,979
um is this an anonymous hack or is this

163
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,320
actually something personal is it do I

164
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,699
actually know the person who was hacked

165
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,220
and then indeed why was I hacked is

166
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,660
there some kind of particular reason is

167
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,039
this actually some kind of something

168
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,020
systematic in trying to trying to kind

169
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,699
of harm me

170
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,360
um

171
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,039
this I think is a kind of quite kind of

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,620
uh revealing uh posting where the the

173
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,080
poster talks about they have a stalker

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,900
and so they purchase a security camera

175
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,280
um and they're terrified they need some

176
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,740
sort of security but then actually turns

177
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,240
out that they actually think that their

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,520
camera has been hacked and that they're

179
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,780
actually whoever's kind of hacked the

180
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,639
cameras in actually actually watching

181
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,440
them through that through the camera you

182
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
can see this kind of slight irony here

183
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,940
that the very device that actually has

184
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,580
been purchased to kind of deal with

185
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,139
um to deal with this kind of situation

186
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,000
is actually turning out then to be

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,740
itself our vulnerability

188
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,460
so

189
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,080
um we return again to this kind of point

190
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,080
about the the for many of these hacks

191
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
um we might not be sure whether it is

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,759
actually a hack going on and indeed

193
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,500
actually users themselves are often not

194
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,680
sure whether there is a hack and it

195
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
seems like for users being in the

196
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
situation of being hacked is actually

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,620
the situation of of really sometimes

198
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,039
quite distressing uncertainty and doubt

199
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,539
because

200
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,580
discovering a hack is really only a

201
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,139
partial Discovery you can never really

202
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,120
be sure you've been hacked and then it

203
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,979
also leads to these as I say there's all

204
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,139
these other kind of unanswered questions

205
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,120
why have I been hacked who's actually

206
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,520
hacked me and it leads an intern to to

207
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,180
can lead to doubt trauma and blame and

208
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,280
it's kind of particularly

209
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,360
um particularly upsetting these are

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
actually of course amongst those who are

211
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,599
particularly vulnerable as I said in the

212
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,400
last case who have actually sometimes

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,160
purchased iot to actually help them deal

214
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,840
with this vulnerability and they find

215
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
this irony where actually comes back and

216
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,799
and then becomes a becomes hacked

217
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,620
um

218
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,599
so how do users deal with the situation

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,220
of thinking that their their device is

220
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,900
being hacked well of course they can

221
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,720
attempt to get technical support

222
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
um uh sometimes they'll go and try and

223
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,139
get kind of legal support in some ways

224
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,580
and then particularly this is kind of

225
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,900
you know there's these are these cases

226
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,819
where people are dealing with

227
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,319
um uh where they think they know the the

228
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,000
whoever is hacking them

229
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,860
um there was these cases where

230
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,720
um uh there was kind of people who were

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,759
in in a sort of apartment below can they

232
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,440
feel that they're neighbors you know who

233
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,580
they're wearing perhaps something a

234
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,840
dispute with have actually hacked into

235
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,940
their Wi-Fi network and so they were

236
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,620
actually kind of the those were the ones

237
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,940
and this kind of brings in I think the

238
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,139
way in which

239
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,199
can be part of this part of a kind of

240
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,819
relationship with those who you're

241
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,560
around so it's not kind of a kind of

242
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,640
disembodied thing but one that's

243
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,958
actually very much part of the

244
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,339
relationships you might have with

245
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,159
ex-partners potential stalkers uh

246
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,500
neighbors and the and the like

247
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,620
and well at times you might so some

248
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,180
skepticism to some of these kind of

249
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,860
accounts that are given have been hacks

250
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,600
it is important to acknowledge that they

251
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,420
do cause real harm and harm here's one

252
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,860
case where

253
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,019
um uh there's a kind of camera that's in

254
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,420
a child's room uh and then the the

255
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,760
child's reports that they hear somebody

256
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,740
talking through the camera and and they

257
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,360
the child thinks it's their mother

258
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,220
that's doing it what Mom why did you

259
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,860
talk to me on the speaker uh right now

260
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,680
he said hey go to sleep uh I don't like

261
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,440
it you said stop playing and go to sleep

262
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
um and then so actually then the child

263
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
comes and kind of reports this to the to

264
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,740
the parent who is obviously distressed

265
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,779
that this is kind of these this is kind

266
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,160
of coming out outside without their

267
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,980
without their control

268
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,860
so um to conclude

269
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,180
um as I say we're kind of focused on

270
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,800
these kind of this question about what

271
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
is it to be hacked what's the user

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,220
experience of being hacked and I think

273
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,420
that leads to kind of quite an

274
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,880
interesting kind of technical uh kind of

275
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
area to think about which is not

276
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,540
designing for preventing hacks but

277
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,580
designing for for support for those who

278
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,160
have been hacked and many of our

279
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,420
participants just had this very simple

280
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,820
question have I been hacked and needed

281
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,480
support on answering that question

282
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,040
and our discussion we'll also talk a lot

283
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,440
about cybernoya which is a kind of term

284
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,320
we kind of use to mean cases where the

285
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,940
technology in this case kind of causes

286
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,500
distress in different ways and

287
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,480
particularly can lead to some uh kind of

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
fears and exact perhapses slightly

289
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
exaggerated fears

290
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,220
um uh through their through their use of

291
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,380
use of Technology

292
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,279
um

293
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,260
and for us I think it's very important I

294
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,899
think to to to kind of move on in how we

295
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,459
think about hacks and to not just think

296
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,680
about them as technical objects but to

297
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,240
think about them as social objects as

298
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
well

299
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
um and in the sense our work is really

300
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,620
just trying to start by letting us think

301
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,240
about what is the what is the life world

302
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,100
of the hack what is the world that the

303
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,980
hack is actually part of

304
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,580
thank you
