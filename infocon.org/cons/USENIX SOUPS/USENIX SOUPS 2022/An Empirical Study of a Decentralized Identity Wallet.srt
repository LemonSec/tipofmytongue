1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,440
and my talk is on an empirical user

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,020
study of a decentralized identity wallet

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,240
our findings offer insight into

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,900
usability security and user control this

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,880
was joint work with Simon Parkin and

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,460
Paul Dunphy

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,519
much of our Lives has moved online and

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
as a result we need to identify

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,200
ourselves online and there are a number

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
of challenges that face this process

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,880
including the risk of identity fraud but

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,100
Additionally the fact that the user

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,260
lacks control over the collection and

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,860
use of their personal information

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,300
user-centric Technologies work to

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,640
address this by focusing on improving

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,219
privacy for the user we see examples

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,680
with the European digital identity as

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,780
well as offerings from companies such as

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,399
Microsoft

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,559
the identity wallet gives users control

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,019
over the transfer and disclosure of

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,420
personal information when identity is

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,760
Federated across online services

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,340
let's use a trust triangle here as an

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,460
example to help us understand this idea

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,799
we have the identifying party the

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,320
relying party and the end user the

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,820
identifying party can be a learning

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,860
institution which certifies that the end

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,140
user completed their studies there the

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,520
relying party could be a potential

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,439
employer who wants to verify this

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,960
information about the end user with the

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
identity wallet the end user could prove

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,560
that they were a student at that

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,380
institution and be able to control and

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,479
therefore choose not to share other

40
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,299
information with the relying party there

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,460
are several implementations of identity

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,680
wallets for example through every name

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,560
let's see and you port

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,320
so identity wallets combine multiple

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
security and privacy processes and these

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,939
are complex to understand and use

47
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,340
we see that this perception that control

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,500
over disclosure of personal data will

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,780
drive user acceptance however this is an

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,520
untested assumption

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,799
additionally we have few trials or

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,840
experiments that have focused on the

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,340
user experience

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,620
given this background then our research

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,660
question was what are the user-centered

56
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,180
privacy and security challenges facing

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,180
the centralized identity wallets

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,680
we carried out a user study we asked

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,540
participants to carry out three tasks

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,940
they needed to make a connection obtain

61
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,620
a credential from the identity provider

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,020
and build an identity proof

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,819
we then carried out a semi-structured

64
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,520
interview and we had participants answer

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,920
a mental model scale which helped us to

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,420
understand

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,340
um whether they got the difference

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,280
between these three tasks we then asked

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,540
them to fill out the system usability

70
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,940
scale to give us a sense of the

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,959
usability of the system

72
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,519
we were able to recruit participants who

73
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,500
were a mix of professional students and

74
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,780
retired individuals we had 15 male and

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,480
15 female participants 17 were based in

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,420
the UK us and 13 were from the UK and we

77
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,739
needed participants who had an Android

78
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,580
phone version 10 and above

79
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,680
looking at our results we'll just

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,019
highlight some of our key findings

81
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,560
we identified interesting

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,940
insights around the user Journey issues

83
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,340
for example with the use of QR codes

84
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,580
this was a challenge for participants

85
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,080
issues around for example focusing the

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,540
phone camera or being able to identify

87
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,159
that they needed to be on the identity

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,680
Wallet app rather than the phone camera

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,040
to capture information we identified

90
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,080
misunderstanding regarding security and

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,299
privacy for example users were unable to

92
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,700
distinguish or were confused by the

93
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,680
credential versus the decentralized

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,920
identifier did we also found that users

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
were uncertain around device switching

96
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
not knowing whether they should be

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,260
carrying out a particular task on the

98
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,019
identity wallet at the identifying party

99
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,180
or at the relying party

100
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,620
there were also authentication

101
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,540
challenges because participants had to

102
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,920
authenticate themselves using a password

103
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,739
so in cases where we had alphanumeric

104
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,900
characters this proved a challenge in

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,220
terms of just identifying where

106
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,200
particular keys were across different

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,019
keyboards and environments

108
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,639
results we found with the sqs

109
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,279
unacceptable score at 71 however we want

110
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,959
to highlight that this still shows that

111
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,580
there's more work needed

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,979
looking again then at the qualitative

113
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,960
results this is just to give us an

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,479
overview of some of what we found so if

115
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,100
you think about then security privacy

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
and Trust in decentralized identity we

117
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,560
identified four themes we have current

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
challenges with identity we see certain

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
assurances participants had about the

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
identity wallet service their

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
expectations of the identifier as well

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,840
as them examining the stakeholders and

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
their rules and trying to understand

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
that so I'll touch on a little bit of

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,620
this in our results

126
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,540
so starting off with current challenges

127
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,180
with identity we found that participants

128
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,060
were resigned to over sharing data kind

129
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,500
of highlighting well that's a ship that

130
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,720
has probably already sailed there's not

131
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
much that can be done about that we also

132
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,800
saw that some participants were

133
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,180
comforted by the fact that they were

134
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,979
asked for a lot of information thinking

135
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,740
it doesn't happen as often or that they

136
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,460
had some control over you know in in a

137
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,020
physical context for example being able

138
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,320
to hand certain information to you know

139
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,580
someone that they can see in front of

140
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,539
them

141
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,180
they highlighted life-changing problems

142
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,979
for example one mentioned because they

143
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,500
shared a name they had a common a name

144
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,820
that is common

145
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,620
um they highlighted that this you know

146
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,880
their name came up on a kind of watch

147
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,979
list and that caused delays when they

148
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,840
were trying to make some purchases and

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,220
we also see them highlighting

150
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,800
convenience and ease of use for example

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,940
just highlighting that they've been

152
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,979
improvements um processes used to take a

153
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,440
week for example but now they take uh

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,979
less time

155
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,060
looking at the assurances about the

156
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,240
identity wallet service users do not

157
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,460
perceive that they were in control right

158
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,080
they instead thought that the

159
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,720
identifying party or the relying party

160
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,320
had greater control in that scenario we

161
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,419
see them highlighting a fear of Bad

162
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,820
actors just thinking oh we're just going

163
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,220
to see a new breed of hackers coming up

164
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,020
we also identified issues that were

165
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,199
interestingly related to what um

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,199
caused participants to trust the process

167
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
here we see them kind of saying well I

168
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,380
don't think I trust my device I would

169
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,900
expect the bank has greater security or

170
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,940
you know has something better than what

171
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,419
I have and they also like the fact that

172
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,120
there was this separation of concerns

173
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,639
the fact that the identifying party

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,919
would not know that they've provided

175
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,600
information to the relying party that

176
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,100
was something that some participants

177
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,220
appreciated

178
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,720
next let's talk about what expectations

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,699
they had of the identifier we see a

180
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,160
sense of confidentiality they thought

181
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
it's kind of like a password and they

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,819
wouldn't expect to be sharing that some

183
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,520
found the procedure confusing thinking

184
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
that it would throw off the average user

185
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,740
um identifying um the identifier and

186
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,720
coding their identity they expected that

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,280
it would have information about their

188
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,500
address their date of birth just linking

189
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
it to what is familiar

190
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,280
um to them with other materials that

191
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,599
they would use to identify themselves

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,300
and finally we see them being confused

193
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,479
about how the identifier was generated

194
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,699
in the first place

195
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,440
finally when it comes to examining

196
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,240
stakeholders and their roles we

197
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,860
identified participants having

198
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,960
confidence in fallbacks so not really

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,000
seeing themselves as part of this

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
process and therefore having

201
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,319
responsibility kind of thinking some

202
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,699
other organization would be in place to

203
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,639
help me out or I can reach out to some

204
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,620
other organization to provide backups

205
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,699
and so on but they didn't really see

206
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,800
themselves as part of that process

207
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,120
others highlighted that it was

208
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,740
unfamiliar that it's definitely

209
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,599
different than a lot of other apps that

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,060
they've used and we also noted um

211
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,180
varying interpretations of minimization

212
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,620
others kind of saying well I might want

213
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,539
to withhold certain information but I

214
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,660
may not be able to say no

215
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,819
so in conclusion we are able to

216
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,400
highlight four key issues here

217
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
first off is just noting this perception

218
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,780
of security and the fact that our

219
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,240
participants Drew trust from the key

220
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,580
actors who are in the study scenario as

221
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,919
opposed to the technical mechanisms

222
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
um that are used in identity the the

223
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,940
decentralized identity wallets

224
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,279
we see a user understanding of entities

225
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,979
in control as a challenge so complex

226
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,479
Technologies a lot of this is hidden

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,559
from users so they didn't quite

228
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,659
understand or found it difficult to tell

229
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,159
them apart

230
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,640
the fact that the complete user autonomy

231
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
is expected was something that our users

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,140
didn't anticipate the fact that they had

233
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,300
responsibility for example of our

234
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,580
backups or you know recovering from

235
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,440
failure was something that they didn't

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,959
have in mind and finally we just want to

237
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,000
emphasize or highlight that ID wallets

238
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
need good usability as an example one

239
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,500
place to start is just with thinking

240
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,019
about how we can use terms that are

241
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,720
easier for users to understand thank you

242
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,459
very much for your attention and I

243
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,660
welcome any questions
