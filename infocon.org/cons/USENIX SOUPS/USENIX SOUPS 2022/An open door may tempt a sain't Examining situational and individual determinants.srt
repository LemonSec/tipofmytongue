1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,880
thank you and thanks for having me today

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,400
yeah the title an Open Door may attempt

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
to Saint examining situational and

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,720
individual determinants of privacy

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,820
invading Behavior that's a collaboration

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,920
of cisbah Hamilton's Institute for

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
information security and zaland

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,619
University

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,960
and what do we mean when we talk about

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,859
privacy invading Behavior we mean

12
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,140
various different kind of behavior from

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,660
harmful behaviors such as

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,420
uh observing others while they type in

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,180
information at the ATM to shoulder

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,059
serving Behavior so observing others in

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,200
their interaction with their mobile

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,680
devices to things like sending the email

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,680
to a wrong person and this wrong person

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
just clicks on attachments and reads the

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,719
email

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,539
in the research there's most research on

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,940
deliberate attacks with harmful

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,580
intentions so how do we prevent those

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,640
harmful attacks but a lot of privacy

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,320
invading Behavior also seems to happen

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,560
without any kind of harmful intentions

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,299
so privacy invading Behavior without

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,939
harmful intentions but still this may

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,880
involve harmful consequences for the

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
ones who are being invaded for the

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,740
invades it may lead to anger it may lead

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,780
to private information becoming public

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,900
for the Invaders themselves it may

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,320
involve things like shame guilt or even

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,360
social conflicts when other people

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,060
realize that you have been investing in

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,460
privacy invading Behavior so we want us

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,860
to understand what makes privacy

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,360
invading Behavior more or less likely so

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,159
we thought about what could be the

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,899
determinants of privacy invading

43
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,579
behavior and we thought about

44
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,680
situational and individual

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,500
characteristics as determinants for

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,720
situational characteristics we thought

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,299
about one that is pretty obvious it is

48
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,640
the effort to engage in privacy invading

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,940
Behavior so if it requires more effort

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,520
to engage in such Behavior it should

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,480
become less likely so the hypothesis we

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,520
had here is that participants will show

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
more privacy invading behavior when

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
accessing private information requires

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,480
less compared to more effort

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
and regarding individual characteristics

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,819
we imagined that some people with

58
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,860
certain personality characteristics for

59
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,200
instance will be more likely than others

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,420
to engage in privacy invading Behavior

61
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,580
so we measured a range of different

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
personality of different individual

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,900
characteristics such as the Big Five

64
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,840
personality characteristics such as

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,360
privacy concerns but also such as

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,340
individual characteristics that align

67
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,560
with parts possible motivations behind

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
privacy invading Behavior so things like

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,180
social curiosity there the research

70
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,200
question pretty open was do any of those

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,180
individual characteristics determine

72
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,580
privacy invading Behavior

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,400
and then we asked ourselves also whether

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
people would admit engaging in such

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
Behavior so admitting privacy invaded

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,680
Behavior can be a first important step

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,099
to reveal data leaks because if nobody

78
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,099
admits that they did engage in privacy

79
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,300
invaded Behavior

80
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,480
it might never become public that there

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,239
may be unauthorized people having access

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
to private Behavior somewhere so

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
admitting this kind of behavior can be a

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,920
good first step to reveal data leaks so

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,459
parallels who are accessing a variable

86
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,980
we also had an admitting variable so

87
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,080
participants were less likely admit

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,900
privacy invading behavior when accessing

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,879
the private information required more

90
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,760
effort because more effort may also

91
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,519
imply oh I engaged in some behavior that

92
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,799
was probably not okay I will not admit

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,060
what I did here

94
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,980
and the research question that is also

95
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,420
parallel would be do individual

96
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,580
characteristics affect the likelihood at

97
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,200
which people admit their privacy

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,239
invading Behavior if they did that

99
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,819
the study was designed in a three-phase

100
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,760
experiments we had 95 student

101
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,978
participants mostly female mostly

102
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,380
relatively young and until the third

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,079
phase we still had 81 participants that

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,660
took part in phase one we had a

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
laboratory setup in this setup we

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,740
invited participants to the lab and we

107
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,840
conducted a an interview with them just

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,180
like a simulated job interview with some

109
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,040
private questions and we told

110
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
participants that we will record that

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,639
interview and we will send them their

112
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,560
interview recordings together with a

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,020
text analyzing some information from

114
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,540
this interview we will send this on the

115
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,460
next day via email

116
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,699
this part of the experiment was just to

117
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,820
yeah introduce people to a context where

118
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,440
there will be private information

119
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,780
generated this was not really our

120
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,699
interest we just had this mock-up

121
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,380
scenario where we introduced

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,840
participants to and in this phase

123
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,020
participants also responded to

124
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,400
questioners assessing their individual

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,199
characteristics what is really

126
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,360
interesting or what us what we were

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,220
really interested in happened in phase

128
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,740
two because their participants received

129
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,039
an email that was for a supposedly other

130
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,000
participants and this email include a

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,220
link to a text file and link to a video

132
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,979
file of the private information of this

133
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,960
other person that was supposedly another

134
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,600
participant that took part in the study

135
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,440
so this simulated oh we sent the email

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
to a wrong person

137
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,620
and then we had an experimental

138
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,919
manipulation in this email either people

139
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,139
could just click on the link and access

140
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,360
the private information all the people

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
had to guess a password from the email

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
which was pretty easy to guess because

143
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,560
it was just the name of the other

144
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,539
participant and then we automatically

145
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,240
captured what participants did did they

146
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,979
click on the link did they enter the

147
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,840
password how long did they interact with

148
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,699
the respective files

149
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,220
and in the last phase we debrief

150
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,500
participants so participants were first

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,380
informed that some emails were

152
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,479
supposedly sent to wrong participants

153
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,580
and we asked them to whether they

154
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,740
accessed those private information

155
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,020
whether they accessed the text whether

156
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,000
they accessed the video and in the end

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,860
of that phase we also did brief

158
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,660
participants about the actual goals of

159
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,639
this study about whether their data was

160
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,979
safe we never really captured their or

161
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,340
recorded their interviews and here are

162
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,699
now the results first just descriptively

163
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,800
how many people really clicked on those

164
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,500
things and interacted with those

165
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,780
um inflammation in the no password

166
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,060
condition we had about 80 in the text

167
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,240
and in the video group who interacted

168
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,539
who accessed those private information

169
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,520
in the group with a password we had

170
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,819
still 40 of people who interacted with

171
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,340
those private information and regarding

172
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,880
admittance rates we see 72 percent in

173
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,360
the tax condition no password 27 in the

174
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,000
video and in the with password condition

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,880
about 40 percent of those who accessed

176
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,120
those files also admitted to doing so

177
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,180
this just descriptively now We examined

178
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,160
this with some statistical tests to see

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
whether those differences are

180
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,160
significant and we found that

181
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,080
participants in the password condition

182
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,319
were less likely to access the files

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,860
okay that supports hypothesis one

184
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,599
the type of information so whether it

185
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,580
was a text or a video did not affect

186
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,220
whether people clicked on that so it was

187
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,860
equally likely to click on a text on a

188
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,500
video and the individual characteristics

189
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,560
did not really predict whether people

190
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,780
accessed those private information files

191
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,740
so

192
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,780
it there was no difference between

193
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,400
people with different individual

194
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
characteristics in accessing the

195
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,940
respective information

196
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,099
regarding admitting privacy invading

197
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,020
Behavior there was no effect of the

198
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,180
password condition so it didn't matter

199
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,680
whether it was more or less effort

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,080
required to

201
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,340
whether then people admitted their

202
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,919
behavior but there was an effect of the

203
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,620
type of information so admitting the

204
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,280
behavior was less likely for video files

205
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,900
and also certain individual

206
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,879
characteristics affected the likelihood

207
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,500
of what the people admitted their

208
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,780
behavior extroversion and online

209
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,479
exhibitionism made it more likely that

210
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,700
people admitted their behavior whereas

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,640
the dark personality facet

212
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,740
machiavellianism made it less likely

213
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,479
that people admitted that

214
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,380
doing so so as a summary a majority of

215
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,480
our participants really engaged in

216
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,760
privacy engaged Behavior so 66 percent

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,540
overall clicked on the text and engaged

218
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,560
with the text 57 for the video and

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
hypothesis one was then supported that

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
engaging in privacy invaded Behavior was

221
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,140
indeed affected by the situational

222
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,459
characteristic

223
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,260
when there was effortless access

224
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,899
possible people were more likely to show

225
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,120
this Behavior an alternative explanation

226
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,279
here would be the password protection

227
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,040
made this somehow seem more private the

228
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,660
information and people were less likely

229
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,899
than to click on the information but the

230
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,519
response to research question one was

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,620
that there was no effect of individual

232
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,140
characteristics on really accessing the

233
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
information admitting privacy invading

234
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,100
Behavior was less likely for the video

235
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,680
file maybe because people assigned

236
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,740
certain value and a higher value to the

237
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,339
video file instead of the text file and

238
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,380
hypothesis 2 was not supported there was

239
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,899
no effect of the password protection on

240
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,580
admitting the Privacy invading Behavior

241
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,980
whereas admitting privacy invading

242
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,899
Behavior was really affected by certain

243
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,180
individual characteristics so some

244
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,100
people were more likely than others to

245
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
admit their behavior limitations here we

246
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,540
only had student participants and it was

247
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,120
a very specific kind of privacy invading

248
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,220
Behavior plus it was restricted to

249
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,320
online Behavior so people were sitting

250
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,779
at home feeling Anonymous that's

251
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,820
probably something different than being

252
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,980
in public and engaging in shoulder

253
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,240
surfing

254
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,640
implications that we see here is that

255
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,440
many are participants really engaged in

256
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
privacy invading Behavior even more when

257
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,760
it required low effort that few

258
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,800
participants admitted engaging in

259
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,140
privacy invading behavior and that then

260
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,260
if that's so data privacy related issues

261
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,660
may be less likely detected if people do

262
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,880
not report on such issues and even

263
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
flawed privacy protection measures such

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,380
an easy to guess passwords can decrease

265
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,540
the temptation to engage in privacy

266
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,980
invading Behavior

267
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,620
thank you for your attention and I'm

268
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,000
happy to take any questions
