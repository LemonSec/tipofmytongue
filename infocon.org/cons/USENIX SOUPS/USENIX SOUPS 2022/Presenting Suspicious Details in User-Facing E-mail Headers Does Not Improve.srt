1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,380
so I'm really excited to be here to talk

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,179
to you about the work that I did with my

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,120
PhD advisor engulf Becker so in this

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,140
case we were interested in investigating

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,820
why people might be susceptible to

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,160
phishing emails and the hypothesis here

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,380
was that people might tend to overlook

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,300
certain details that you can find and

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,119
typically displayed email headers that

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,300
contain for instance send the details so

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,700
in this talk I'll

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,500
walk you through the experimental setup

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,640
and mention the key results that we had

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,700
so we know that the threat of fishing is

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,040
still growing and that in fact nearly

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,579
half of the modern security breaches

18
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,440
nowadays involves some form of fishing

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,559
and this means that purely Technical

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,899
Solutions to filter out fishing emails

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,559
are not sufficient apparently to prevent

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,500
people from falling for them so that

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,840
means in order to improve people's

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,020
ability to detect these emails we need

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,360
to gain a deeper understanding of why do

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,979
people actually fall for fishing in the

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,540
first place

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,420
so some previous Works have relied on

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,159
information processing Theory from

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,400
cognitive Sciences which says that there

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,140
are two different routes with which

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,299
people process information the central

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,520
route and peripheral route so the

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
central route actually relates a little

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
bit to what David Rand was talking about

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,159
where people very carefully appraised

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,340
information that they see where you can

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,400
imagine if you are browsing your emails

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,140
you might rely more on a peripheral

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,479
information processing route where you

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,040
don't necessarily carefully appraise

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,500
every detail you see in email so that

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,659
leads to be to the idea that people

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,119
actually might miss or misinterpret cues

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,860
that actually give away the

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,020
suspiciousness of an email

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,659
so what we were testing here is more

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,640
specifically is where do people have a

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,100
blind spot perhaps for certain details

50
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
that you find in the typically displayed

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,179
email headers so I'm not talking about

52
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,700
the big technical headers as we saw in

53
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,420
the morning but what you typically see

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,760
as a subject line the sender name and

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
the Senate email address

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
so or a central hypothesis was that

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
people should be better at detecting

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
phishing emails with the suspicious

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,920
header details when they are only

60
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,680
presented with these user-facing email

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,620
headers so we tested this with a between

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,260
subjects design with three groups

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,020
starting with the control group where we

64
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,860
presented a set of emails to to

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,440
participants

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
with both the email header as well as

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,940
the email message and then in the second

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,640
group bodyless we presented them the

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,980
same set of emails but we only presented

70
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,980
the user facing email header and in the

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,500
headerless condition as you might expect

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,800
we only presented the subject line and

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,379
the body part of the email

74
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,140
and then people's task in this case was

75
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,720
to imagine they were working as an

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,180
executive assistant in effective company

77
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,760
setting where they had to process emails

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,140
for their boss

79
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,900
and they saw emails one by one and you

80
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,340
can see an example here in the control

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,640
version where the email display mimic

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
that of Gmail and then underneath it

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
there were two options they had to

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,900
either discard the email or say hey this

85
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,420
needs my boss's attention and when they

86
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
would click on this card they had to

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,980
indicate a specific reason for why to do

88
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,200
so it's either as an executive assistant

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
they could take care of this or they

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,180
could label it as spam phishing or give

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,459
another reason and if it was other they

92
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,019
had to specify with free text what would

93
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,340
be the reason

94
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,519
in this case we it was very important

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,980
for us that we had a sample that was a

96
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,040
representative of the general population

97
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,780
and we gathered these people through

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,720
prolific and throughout the whole task

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,939
we also checked people's user

100
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,080
interactions

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,760
so that allowed us to see if people

102
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,519
actually hovered over for instance

103
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,579
suspicious URLs that we also had in some

104
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,320
of the phishing emails

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,139
so for the email set we had 32

106
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,180
legitimate emails that we adapted from

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,479
the Enron Emos database and for the

108
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
fishing animals we made sure we had a

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,100
wide range of flavors

110
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,220
starting with two spare fishing or CEO

111
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,979
fraud type of fishing emails then we had

112
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,639
two examples of Nigerian print scams two

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,280
examples of a security warning where

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,160
people had to change the password on a

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
malicious website

116
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,419
and then a malicious file sharing link

117
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,660
as well as a zoom scan has emerged

118
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,639
through during the pandemic where people

119
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,280
were sent an email saying hey you missed

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,320
this Zoom conference click on this link

121
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,900
to retrieve the recording which actually

122
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,600
led to downloading some malicious file

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,020
so here we specifically expected these

124
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,919
five phishing emails to be detectable by

125
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,460
only looking at these header details

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,759
so then we computed for every of these

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,520
eight phishing emails how many people in

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,380
each of the conditions labeled it as

129
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,460
phishing

130
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,400
and for the five emails that we just

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,919
indicated we actually see that the ones

132
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,900
that did not see the body message of the

133
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,419
email but only the email header were

134
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,400
actually not necessarily better than in

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,199
the control condition at detecting them

136
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,380
which we found quite surprising

137
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,880
um and from this week concluded that

138
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
most people actually do not recognize

139
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,900
deception tactics that cyber criminals

140
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,820
often use when they craft these phishing

141
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,919
emails

142
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,139
then next we looked at how many people

143
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,479
actually hovered over any of these

144
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,759
malicious links that we had in half of

145
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,580
the phishing emails as you can see here

146
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,759
and you can tell that nearly nobody

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
actually hovered over the emails and out

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
of the people that actually did hover

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,080
over the emails actually they did not

150
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,479
seem to recognize that the URL was

151
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,000
suspicious namely they did not label

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,539
that Emo's fishing or spam so from here

153
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,520
we would conclude that common email

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
security recommendations such as

155
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,720
hovering over URLs are not really

156
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,580
applied in practice by the General

157
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,919
Public

158
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,220
so for the last part here we were

159
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,979
interested in why do perhaps certain

160
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,740
people fall more for phishing so this

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,660
relies on the idea that there might be a

162
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,759
certain demographic that seems

163
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,699
particularly susceptible to fishing in

164
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,400
the past people have looked at gender

165
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,139
people with low Tech Affinity the

166
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,319
elderly people were less educated and

167
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,479
different types of personality traits

168
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,039
but the issue with those kinds of

169
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,900
studies is that often they were

170
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,880
inconsistent and therefore inconclusive

171
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,340
due to different methods that they

172
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,160
applied you can think of different

173
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,740
sampling biases or even biases within

174
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,020
the phishing emails that they used to

175
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,819
measure people's ability to detect

176
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,319
fishing

177
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,979
so in our study we had all kinds of

178
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,380
personal traits as well and many

179
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,380
demographics like age gender education

180
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,340
level and income some information about

181
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,440
people's past experiences regarding

182
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,259
receiving phishing emails as well as a

183
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,460
question about their subjective ex um

184
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,620
indication of how good they are at cyber

185
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,199
security and then we had some questions

186
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,720
relating to privacy concerns and the Big

187
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,639
Five personality traits

188
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,699
and we try to predict people's actual

189
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,740
phishing detection ability with these

190
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,020
four different

191
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,360
types of factors first of all we defined

192
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,160
phishing detection ability as fishing

193
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,380
detection recall which means out of all

194
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,120
the eight fishing games that we showed

195
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,500
to them how many did they actually

196
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,080
labels as fishing and we did the same

197
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,900
for fishing detection Precision so out

198
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,759
of all the emails that people thought

199
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,379
were fishing how many were actually

200
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,479
fishing

201
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,220
and from all these hierarchical

202
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,160
regressions that we ran we did not find

203
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,340
any consistent prediction from any of

204
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,800
these personal traits to these metrics

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,719
of phishing detection ability

206
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,120
so we conclude here that personal trades

207
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
do not

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
um are not a reliable source to see how

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,320
susceptible people are to fishing

210
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,740
so in terms of the main takeaways here

211
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,660
we found that people do not recognize

212
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,720
online deception tactics secondly that

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,760
personal traits do not reliably predict

214
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
fishing susceptibility

215
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,200
and that means that we need different

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,240
tools that actually help people to

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,300
detect fishing yields better

218
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,740
so that thank you for your attention
