1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,340
um yes so good morning everyone and

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,040
thank you for attending this talk

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,780
um I'm Jessica konago and I'm going to

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,460
be presenting our paper in which we

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,420
explore

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,820
the ability of different privacy scales

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,439
to capture and distinguish granular

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,300
privacy constructs

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,279
so before I start I want to clarify what

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,380
we mean by privacy scales

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,019
so they are privacy scales use multiple

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,180
statements to capture respondents views

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,579
on privacy and generally speaking scales

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,320
are very thoroughly validated when

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,579
they're developed and have consistent

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,140
results over time

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,719
an example of a very common privacy

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,160
scale that is used in the Privacy

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,899
literature is the internet users

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,600
information privacy concern scale

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,059
normally you just say ioipc because it's

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,100
a mouthful which is intended to capture

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,600
privacy concern across multiple

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,100
subdomains

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,079
valid privacy scale can offer really

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,180
useful insights into public perspective

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,300
on privacy but a skill that is not valid

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,459
that is like a skill that fails to

29
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,280
measure what is intended to measure

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,180
presents a challenge for privacy

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,159
research because it will yield results

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,840
that cannot sustain accurate

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,119
generalizations or that lack predictive

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,260
power

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,299
and password has also identified some

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,100
issues with regard to the framing of a

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,259
scale both at the statement level and at

38
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,720
the scale level and there's also been

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,880
more recent work that's challenged the

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,100
validity of existing scales and this

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,360
last issue is pretty damning and

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,580
confusing because for you to propose a

43
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,840
new scale you need to show strong

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,700
validity in multiple areas like internal

45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,640
validity construct validity Etc

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,500
so just to contextualize like why this

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,180
is a problem let me paint up a familiar

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,640
picture to most of you so let's imagine

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,060
someone answered the 10 item iuypc scale

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,680
and they come back as someone with high

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
levels of privacy concern on all of us

52
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,820
three sub scales

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,040
we then go talk to this person about

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,320
what they do with regards to their

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
information privacy and we see that

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,740
they're like an avid social media user

57
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,299
posting a lot of things about themselves

58
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,320
online

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,119
and they have all sorts of smart devices

60
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,680
in their home

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
oops

62
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,580
so there's lack of consistency between

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,379
express attitudes and preferences and

64
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,300
their actual Behavior would seem like a

65
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,459
classical example of the Privacy paradox

66
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,099
but what if what if it isn't

67
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,140
so when we've investigated the Privacy

68
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,239
Paradox in the past we've often focused

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,160
on the participant to try to understand

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,440
this mismatch you know maybe they didn't

71
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,239
Express themselves correctly maybe they

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,620
didn't understand how much of their

73
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,480
privacy they were giving up by engaging

74
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
these behaviors which are all very valid

75
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,500
in real reasons right privacy is

76
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,020
complicated is an evolving concept we as

77
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,940
Scholars don't all agree on what it

78
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,379
means

79
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,879
um there are psychological theories that

80
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,340
can explain that people how people will

81
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,620
arrive at two very different ways of

82
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,480
thinking about the same issue

83
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,280
and we also know that like information

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,280
extremity asymmetry and cognitive biases

85
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,540
are a really big problem when it comes

86
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,220
to privacy

87
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,900
but what if we focus on our tools

88
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,180
instead right it could be an issue of

89
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,519
context since our existing privacy

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,140
scales were meant for like a very

91
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,540
specific context like information

92
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,900
privacy in a corporate setting poor cfip

93
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,640
and maybe they just don't generalize

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,739
well to other contexts

95
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,780
it could also be that our privacy scales

96
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,220
just aren't working the way that we

97
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,300
think they should

98
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,099
and in this work we focus on

99
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,720
understanding how well statements used

100
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,700
in existing privacy scales capture the

101
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,140
constructs that they are meant to

102
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,640
capture

103
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
and particularly in particular we're

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,300
looking to better understand how well

105
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,280
existing privacy scales capture and

106
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,840
distinguish between different privacy

107
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,700
constructs and we also wanted to

108
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,080
identify whether we can create

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,700
statements that are better suited to

110
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,220
capture specific ones

111
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,260
to achieve these goals we took three

112
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,659
steps the first one is that we needed to

113
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,340
select which constructs we're going to

114
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,680
focus on and to do this we leveraged

115
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,840
existing findings in the literature and

116
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
we started from a set of constructs and

117
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,319
definitions that shove and Crainer

118
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,080
proposed in a chapter for the iippp book

119
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,700
called usable and useful privacy

120
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,980
interfaces

121
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,840
then we had to go about finding good

122
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,340
definitions for them because this is

123
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,900
something that's actually missing in the

124
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,860
literature

125
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,659
so we started from definitions that are

126
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,040
close to what was proposed by Charlotte

127
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,959
Crainer and then we collected feedback

128
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,600
from 23 privacy experts on the

129
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,760
definitions and we used their agreements

130
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,740
and disagreements to revise the

131
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,560
definitions in an iterative way

132
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,840
once we had what we consider to be

133
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
consistent and stable in a stable set of

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
definitions we moved on to collect data

135
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,979
to identify which constructs are related

136
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,960
to different statements

137
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,240
for a study we focus on statements from

138
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,419
cfip so concern for information privacy

139
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,280
gipc Global Information privacy concern

140
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,880
the Western segmentation index iypc I'm

141
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,800
not going to say that again

142
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,660
and some statements that we generated

143
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,740
ourselves

144
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
given the presentation duration I'm

145
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,520
going to focus only on the methodology

146
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,860
and results for step three you can refer

147
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
to the paper you can come talk to me

148
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,540
about steps one and two

149
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,259
so to do the classification survey we

150
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,479
recruited participants using prolific's

151
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,639
representative sample for U.S

152
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,759
participants and we had 400 participants

153
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,100
such that each statement was seen by at

154
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
least 40 people

155
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,340
we showed participants and definitions

156
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,620
and some brief instructions followed by

157
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,900
seven randomly selected blocks where we

158
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,639
asked participants to imagine they were

159
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,380
talking to a friend and that their

160
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,240
friend said one of the statements that

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,620
we were investigated

162
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,960
then we asked participants to select how

163
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,820
well each construct described what they

164
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,900
thought their friend is trying to

165
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,440
communicate by saying that statement

166
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,479
so to start our analysis we first wanted

167
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,280
to know if the statements were uniquely

168
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,979
described by a single construct and we

169
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,979
started looking at this by grouping

170
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,560
binning participant responses into high

171
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,080
and low scores we checked the robustness

172
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,680
of our grouping approach by combining

173
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,180
the neutral option both in the high and

174
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,500
the low and there wasn't really a

175
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,699
difference

176
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,199
and then for each statement we

177
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,880
determined whether there was a primary

178
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,820
construct by looking on a per statement

179
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,900
basis

180
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,479
at the two constructs that had the

181
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,300
highest count of high scores and we

182
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,560
compared the counts of high and low

183
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,120
scores using chi-square tests and

184
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Kramer's V to determine whether the top

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,479
construct was statistically different

186
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,580
from the second highest construct and

187
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,940
how big of an effect size it was

188
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,440
so the results of this analysis

189
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
indicated that the majority of

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
statements were not described by a

191
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,960
single primary construct and even that

192
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
those that did have a primary construct

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
often had small effect sizes

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,699
and this clear mapping between statement

195
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,400
and construct can be explained by the

196
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,020
statements not having been construed in

197
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,180
a sufficient clear way but also it could

198
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,500
be that the constructs we're

199
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,360
investigating may not be easily

200
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,000
separable and there's actually

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
um backing from the Linguistics side of

202
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,180
things to support evidence too so we

203
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,039
wanted to investigate the seemingly more

204
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,780
complex relationship between the

205
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,759
constructs and the statements and to do

206
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
that we use non-negative Matrix

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
factorization

208
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,460
can get into details on the method even

209
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,960
though I want to so come talk to me

210
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,340
afterwards if you have questions or read

211
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,440
the paper but the intuition behind this

212
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,060
method is that you can go from a high

213
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,099
dimensional space in this case or six

214
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,319
constructs you can extract some usable

215
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,620
features from it you identify a reduced

216
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,060
space of what we are calling

217
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,759
metaconstructs that are composed by the

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,440
original sex constructs in different

219
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,740
amounts and then it also identifies how

220
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,360
these meta constructs relates to the

221
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,400
original data points and essentially

222
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,960
does this by decomposing the original

223
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,560
data Matrix into two matrices

224
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,139
so essentially we went from like six

225
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,300
contracts to five metacars so it's not a

226
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,060
huge reduction and I wanted to highlight

227
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,039
that while we did name them based on the

228
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,539
constructs that were more significant

229
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,240
when composing the composed by the

230
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
construct

231
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,419
they aren't perfectly independent for

232
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,220
example if you look at the concern meta

233
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,199
construct it's while it is composed

234
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,660
primarily of cons of concern it also has

235
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,580
some attitude aspects to it and to a

236
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,259
lesser degree preference decision and

237
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,660
behavior

238
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,060
so with these meta constructs that in

239
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,039
hand we could then examine the different

240
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,020
statements based on their metacoster

241
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,780
composition in the paper we present the

242
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,060
composition using a heat map

243
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,160
visualization where darker colors

244
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,780
mean that the meta construct is more

245
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,919
predominant

246
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,500
and it's pretty much impossible to read

247
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,779
slide you have the heat mats for the

248
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,640
statements that had attitude as a more

249
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,200
predominant meta construct on the left

250
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,419
and on the right you have the heat maps

251
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,099
for the statements that had the decision

252
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,860
plus Behavior meta construct on

253
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,899
the right yes

254
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,700
so

255
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,399
by analyzing the results we got from nmf

256
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,860
we found that again very few statements

257
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,140
had only one meta construct

258
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,740
for example while I believe other people

259
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,540
are too much concerned with online

260
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,580
privacy issues seems to be more

261
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,500
predominantly composed by the attitude

262
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,839
metaconstruct I feel that Society

263
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,700
worries too much about privacy is pretty

264
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,680
clearly split between concern and

265
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,600
attitude

266
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,640
and when we looked at our results on a

267
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
per scale level we see that the scales

268
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,820
we investigated frequently had

269
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,920
statements that capture a combination of

270
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,060
reference and concern

271
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,300
um something that I think was

272
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,040
interesting was that even the statements

273
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,140
that we generated specifically for these

274
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,420
constructs seem to well they fare a

275
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,740
little bit better like they had like an

276
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,959
85 percent match with the construct that

277
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,660
we originally intended them to capture

278
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
we still see that most statements are

279
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,899
really a composition of different meta

280
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,380
constructs

281
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,779
so all these results do paint a little

282
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,240
bit of a bleak picture about our ability

283
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,800
to distinguish between commonly used

284
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,540
privacy constructs we still wanted to

285
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,180
understand what we can do to better

286
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,580
create statements since scales are

287
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,320
really really useful tool right and we

288
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,360
want to be able to use them

289
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,279
so to do this we collaborated with Dr

290
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,399
Kate Jane a professor of linguistics at

291
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,899
the University of Pittsburgh who helped

292
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,420
us conduct a corpus analysis based on

293
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,120
the nmf categorization which identified

294
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,279
some coarse grain regularities in the

295
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,019
kinds of words found in the statements

296
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,060
that were robustly associated with a

297
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,399
primary construct and these regularities

298
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
may be exploited oops by in in future

299
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,620
prompt Construction

300
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,740
so for example from our analysis we had

301
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,180
some categories of words that were more

302
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,500
likely to be associated with the

303
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,560
statement we had verb signaling desire

304
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,320
and modal signaling desired outcomes

305
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,360
more being more commonly associated with

306
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
privacy preferences which kind of makes

307
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,100
sense intuitively whereas expression

308
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,680
signaling negative perceptions were more

309
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,300
frequently associated with privacy

310
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,120
concern on the paper you have a table in

311
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
the appendix that like has

312
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,079
all of the categories broken down very

313
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,560
individually

314
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,600
um and as you can see in the slide

315
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,760
we have a few key ways to keep

316
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,680
statements better right we want to have

317
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,019
them be short because then you limit the

318
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,519
features that may be connected to

319
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,860
multiple constructs and right now a lot

320
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,320
of this the scales have pretty long

321
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,459
statements

322
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,459
you want which is kind of confusing but

323
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,860
you also want them to be descriptive so

324
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,019
they need to be short and descriptive to

325
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,220
reduce the amount of background

326
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,019
information that the reader will fill in

327
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,240
themselves if you let leave things to be

328
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,920
vague or that can have multiple

329
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,019
interpretations you're going to the

330
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,820
interpretation of the statement will be

331
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,440
heavily influenced by people's

332
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,660
background information

333
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,519
and you also want it to be focused so

334
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,019
that you can reduce the range of

335
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,820
interpretation that any one reader might

336
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,920
have of that statement

337
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,360
so our takeaways are essentially that

338
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,220
existing scales frequently don't have

339
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,480
statements that capture only the

340
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,820
constructs that were designed to capture

341
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,279
though with careful consideration it may

342
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,620
be possible to create better statements

343
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,140
in that privacy related constructs are

344
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,360
really intertwined and if your work

345
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,399
requires you to clearly distinguish

346
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,740
between them for example you clearly

347
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,480
need to separate preferences from

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
concerns you need to do that with

349
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,800
extreme care and you might need to

350
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,500
evaluate whether

351
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,000
statements and scales are the best tool

352
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
to do that

353
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,899
I'm happy to take any of your questions

354
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,540
and also happy to talk about it

355
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,079
afterwards
