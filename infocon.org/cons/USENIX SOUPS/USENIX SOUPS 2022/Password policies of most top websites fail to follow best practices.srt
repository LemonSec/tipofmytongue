00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,099
hello my name is Kevin Lee I'll be

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,019
talking about our paper in which we

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,059
investigated the password policies of

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,400
top websites and found most were not

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,520
following best practices

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,800
passwords continue to play an important

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,320
role in our digital lives they Remain

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,359
the most common authentication method on

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,560
the web

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,840
in addition adoption of password

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,059
managers which can automatically

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,480
generate secure random passwords remains

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,300
low for many reasons therefore making

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
sure users create strong passwords is an

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,739
ever important goal

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,960
there are thankfully Decades of usable

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,940
security research that have been spent

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,100
thinking about this and have centered

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,800
around three interventions block lists

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,620
strength meters and composition policies

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,420
or pcps

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,640
essentially the recommendations from

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,960
research are block common weak passwords

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,540
encourage strong hard to guess passwords

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,180
do not make it frustrating for users to

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,820
create these passwords

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,580
the research is clear passwords have

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,860
long been researched in Academia and in

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
the lab setting what's less clear is

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,240
whether real world websites are

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,119
following these recommendations today

33
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,700
in this study we were interested in

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,560
learning about how websites are letting

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,600
users create passwords

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,060
we asked the following questions

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,460
are websites preventing users from using

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,680
the most common passwords

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
our websites using password strength

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,460
meters to encourage hard to guess

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,140
passwords

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
what pcps are used

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,299
you'll notice that each question lines

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,040
up with each of the three interventions

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I described in the previous slide

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,560
we answer this by reverse engineering

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,680
the password policies at 120 of the top

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,119
English language websites

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,200
let's look at the first question

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,299
here we measured whether popular

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,880
websites prevent users from choosing the

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,520
most common insecure passwords

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,099
we selected 40 common passwords to test

54
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,099
from two different block lists the 100

55
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,260
000 most frequently used passwords found

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,660
in password breaches released from a

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,300
data breach notification service and

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
passwords guest early on by an ensemble

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,959
of cracking tools here we used pgs a

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,300
widely used free tool provided by other

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,400
researchers

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,099
those represent two strategies in which

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,140
websites might construct block lists

64
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,080
block frequent passwords or those guest

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,780
early on by cracking tools

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,060
so we went into these websites and tried

67
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,099
to change our password to each of these

68
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,840
4D passwords

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
if we were successful in setting the

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,040
password we locked out and logged back

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,140
in to confirm that the password was

72
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,140
successfully changed

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,260
we found 71 sites allowed all passwords

74
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,400
to be set

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500
that's over half of the websites we

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,700
tested

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,040
many of these were not small websites

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
either some have hundreds of millions of

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,819
users

80
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,400
more than half of these 71 sites store

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,700
sensitive information such as pii and

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,260
payment information

83
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,140
additionally 19 websites seem to have

84
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,780
insufficient strategies only blocking

85
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,000
simple sequences such as one two three

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
or password

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,760
all in all only 22 websites managed to

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,620
deny us from setting these leaked and

89
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,860
easiest guest passwords

90
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,319
we continue to our second study by

91
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,360
investigating password strength meters

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,980
used at websites

93
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,200
the best practice here is to show

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,239
real-time feedback while a user is

95
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,879
creating a password and to measure the

96
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,920
guest number for that password not the

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,480
number of different character classes

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,040
present

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,440
we tested the password input fields and

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,599
looked for any feedback on the page that

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,900
would indicate password strength

102
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,180
so we found disappointing numbers among

103
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,840
the 120 websites only 23 websites had

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,939
strength meters at all

105
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,459
among those we further reverse

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,279
engineered their behavior by testing 100

107
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,680
of the easiest guest passwords on each

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,759
meter

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,979
we also boundary tested by testing

110
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,540
strings of different lengths and

111
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,880
different types of characters

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,680
and we found 10 of them were actually

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
using their password strength meters as

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
nudges towards requiring specific types

115
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,040
of characters

116
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,199
six of them came on websites with no

117
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,419
character class requirements

118
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,580
so this means that their strength meter

119
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,800
was actually being used as a proxy for a

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,320
character class pcps like in the figure

121
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,060
below

122
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,759
four of them were from websites with

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,740
character class requirements however

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,440
these websites encourage even more

125
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,020
complexity than required

126
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,300
we further investigated whether feedback

127
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,220
from the strength meter matched what was

128
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,320
happening at the server

129
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,600
if a password is marked Weak by the

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
meter for example will a website still

131
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,740
accept it

132
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,960
we found over half websites were

133
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,780
inconsistent so passwords were either

134
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,660
marked strong and ultimately rejected or

135
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,600
weak and ultimately accepted both make

136
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,180
for a confusing user experiences on top

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,960
of insecurity

138
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,580
for our third analysis we look to see

139
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,960
whether recommendations against

140
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,060
requiring specific types of characters

141
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,680
were paying off

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,780
we did so by reverse engineering the

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,059
pcps being used at these websites

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,400
we found 45 of websites still using

145
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,440
character class requirements despite

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,960
research against the recommendation

147
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,240
we also found that websites with

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,759
character class pcps were more likely to

149
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,639
allow leaked and easiest guest passwords

150
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,580
why does this matter it could mean that

151
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,560
websites think these complex rules are

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,660
good enough and they don't need to check

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,820
passwords on a case-by-case basis

154
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,080
putting it all together

155
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
we considered a website to be following

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,820
best practices if it satisfied all three

157
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,979
of the following security and usability

158
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,539
criteria

159
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,860
first

160
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,919
if the website allowed five or fewer of

161
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,020
the 40 most common passwords we tried

162
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,580
and study one

163
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,940
only 22 websites met that Mark

164
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,259
second

165
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,360
if the website used the strength meter

166
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,780
to accurately model disability or

167
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,880
if it's set an 8 character minimum

168
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,919
length which is a recommendation from

169
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,780
the National Institute of Standards and

170
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,979
Technology

171
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,759
77 websites met this Criterium

172
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,780
third

173
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,360
from a usability standpoint if the

174
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,759
website did not require users include

175
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,500
specific types of characters in their

176
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,699
password

177
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,240
66 websites met the Criterium

178
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,699
so a website would be following best

179
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,860
practices if it blocked weak passwords

180
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,319
fostered strong passwords and if it

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,080
didn't cause such a hassle to users

182
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,600
we found only 15 websites that were

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
following best practices in your

184
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,120
password policy

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,220
our findings reveal an indisputable gap

186
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,199
between password policy research and

187
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,280
practice

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,860
we suggest future research that directly

189
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,319
engages with system administrators in

190
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,240
order to understand their mindset on

191
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,979
passport security

192
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,680
researchers May then be able to uncover

193
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,539
the reasons for this disconnect between

194
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,300
industry and the academic community and

195
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,460
take steps towards reconciling this

196
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,720
disparity

197
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,419
some hypotheses to keep in mind password

198
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,539
policy is security theater measures such

199
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,280
as requiring specific types of

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,039
characters even if ineffective may give

201
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,380
users a false sense of security and

202
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,319
websites use them for this reason

203
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,840
websites have shifted their attention to

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,340
adopting other authentication

205
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,380
Technologies such as two-factor

206
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,780
authentication and believe that it is

207
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,639
unnecessary to strengthen their password

208
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,580
policies and to note this view might be

209
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,160
over optimistic as plenty of recent work

210
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,560
in our community has found weaknesses in

211
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,199
certain types of 2fa

212
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,660
websites need to pass security Audits

213
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,460
and the firms who do these audits

214
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,400
recommend or mandate outdated practices

215
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,740
we actually saw anecdotal evidence of

216
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,839
this when we very recently talked about

217
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
our paper with colleagues from different

218
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,860
institutions

219
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,719
websites face some other practical

220
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,458
constraint that the academic Community

221
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,539
does not know about

222
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,180
to recap we found most top websites were

223
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,040
not following best practices in your

224
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,540
password policy

225
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,700
users are either at risk from being

226
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,279
allowed to set vulnerable passwords and

227
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,200
or frustrated from character class

228
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,060
requirements

229
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,220
advice from the research Community is

230
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,500
clear but it looks like practice lags

231
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,180
research

232
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,279
in order to better understand this Gap

233
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,500
we need to start a dialogue with system

234
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,360
administrators to understand their

235
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,860
mindset on password security

236
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,240
to read our detailed method and full

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
findings and to access our data set

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,620
