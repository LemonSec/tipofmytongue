2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,200
I'd like to give a quick overview of our

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,379
work titled understanding noise but

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,600
security and the Privacy related

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,500
questions or kill under aside

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,320
prior Studies have revealed that no

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,420
expert users sometimes search for

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
answers to security and privacy issues

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,800
on Queue on the side

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,880
just we can expect Q on the inside to be

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
a useful information source for

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,500
researchers to understand user concerns

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,239
into daily lives

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,079
in usable security and privacy Community

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,640
also post on Q android sites for

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,239
developers such as stack Overflow open

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,800
well studied

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
there is little research on posts on

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,440
Q100 sites for no expert users

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,379
in our study we able to answer the

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,480
following two research questions

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,799
one

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,040
what topics do no expert users ask about

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,960
on Q android site

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,560
two which topics do no expertise that's

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,640
passive as more serious or sensitive

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,340
be investigated a Japanese skill on the

exporter uses in Japan

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,780
be analyzed the

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,060
1445 question posts which consisted of

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,320
three subset or subset one we collected

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,780
questions posted in security related

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,380
categories for example a category named

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,180
network security

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,240
for subset too we collected questions

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,540
that contains the term security and or

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,040
privacy

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,520
for subset 3 we collected questions that

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,860
contained security and privacy related

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,780
words such as Cloud app and account

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,020
we analyze the topic seriousness and

45
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,360
sensitivity of each question

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,599
two quarters label the theme and subsum

47
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,400
of the question topics

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,459
to evaluate the question seriousness we

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,760
used two metrics metallic one was

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,280
correlated seriousness

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,340
the two codas related seriousness using

52
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,040
a five-point record scale

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,739
the quotas related equation seriousness

54
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,379
higher when asked the linguistically

55
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,220
expressed honesty anxiety or alcohol

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,840
help

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,980
metallic 2 was Visa Oscars of our Rivers

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,660
for the best dancers

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,720
for Christian sensitivity we measured

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,580
whether ascots posted questions

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,480
anonymously

62
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,280
now let's move on to our results we

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,599
identified seven themes and the 1917 the

64
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
most hurricane theme was Cyber attack

65
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,099
followed by authentication security

66
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,220
software privacy office account and

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,860
device management secure connection and

68
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,379
privacy setting

69
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,200
we identified a wide range of user

70
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
concerns here I will introduce just a

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,580
few percent

72
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,459
many users post questions to determine

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,379
if they were a victim of a Cyber attack

74
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,260
and how to respond to it

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,900
users were over likely to be faced with

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,480
typical technical support scams and

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
fishing attacks

78
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,500
some users were concerned whether their

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,900
device had to be infected the moment

80
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,879
they access the suspicious URL

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,580
regarding authentication many users had

82
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,860
authentication alerts because they had

83
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,959
to change their digital phone number or

84
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,340
email address

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,400
in addition users were not able to find

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,739
the contact point of services for

87
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,620
resolvings errors

88
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,879
users also ask about security software

89
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,439
specifically related to the usability

90
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,980
issues product features and necessity of

91
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,780
antivirus software

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,959
for example some users struggle to stop

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,839
being blocked from estimate access

94
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,180
users struggle to understand its

95
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,520
features because antivirus software

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,280
displays many technical terms but did

97
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,340
not include a detailed explanation

98
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,580
some users wondered which was better

99
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,500
using over standard antivirus software

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,020
or purchasing their own antivirus

101
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,220
software

102
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,919
users who use their devices for limited

103
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,199
purposes who are skeptical about the

104
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,979
necessity of antivirus software

105
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,979
we found that users posted highly

106
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,860
sensitive questions about privacy abuse

107
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,800
specifically some users posted about

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
suffering from intimate partial abuse

109
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,820
others presumably children often asked

110
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,280
for information about excessive parental

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,740
control on the Q a side

112
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,440
users wanted to know whether they were

113
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,780
under surveillance and how to escape

114
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,799
from surveillance

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,100
wanted to know how to sell better Target

116
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,500
for example they asked about the future

117
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,020
of Spyware apps

118
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,840
no expert users were concerned about

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,660
safe ways to set up or dispose of the

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,020
accounts and devices for example many

121
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,600
users reported that they were not able

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,639
to find the delete option on online

123
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,860
services

124
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,500
most of the question in the same secure

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,280
connection were about Wi-Fi and vpns

126
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,919
users were confused by many technical

127
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,259
terms such as names of security

128
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,080
standards and encryption methods that

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
appeared on Wi-Fi connection settings

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,320
screens

131
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,240
and so you just asked about

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,740
effectiveness of baby ants for example

133
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,139
users who are curious if a VPN protect

134
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,020
users on a public Wi-Fi

135
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,900
regarding privacy setting some users

136
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,820
asked about the cookies

137
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,259
for example

138
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,780
users wanted to know how to change their

139
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,580
cookie settings

140
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,340
other users had difficulty understanding

141
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,139
the meaning and mechanism of

142
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,720
personalization or privacy setting page

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
of social media

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,360
we analyze the Christian seriousness and

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,699
the sensitivity of each sin and found

146
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,979
that coated seriousness of questions

147
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,979
about privacy abuse and account and

148
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,259
device management was significantly

149
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,080
higher than other topics the percentage

150
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,360
of questions for which Ascot State

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,580
rewards and that of the question in

152
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,220
which Oscars posted anonymously varied

153
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,000
somewhat by topic but not significantly

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,699
we also found that Oscars were likely to

155
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,919
either appear linguistically or over

156
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,440
levels as a strategy to obtain answers

157
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,199
now let me summarize our findings

158
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,979
finding one

159
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,680
users struggle to determine whether they

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,500
had been victimized by Cyber attack

161
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,120
finding two

162
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
through our analysis we found that users

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,240
had difficulty explaining their issues

164
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,759
users tend to explain registration by

165
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,099
attaching screenshot rather than by

166
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,160
describing it in detail in writing

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,460
to authorize these challenges qandy site

168
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,259
providers should provide a knowledge

169
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,780
based system that asks for missing

170
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,800
information and present a solution

171
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,280
finding three users posted highly

172
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,039
privacy sensitive questions to address

173
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,680
this providers should implement the

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
