1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,420
and I'm pursuing my masters in computer

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,480
science at the University of Denver

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,580
since the start of the pandemic the FBI

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,820
has seen a 400 rise in reports of cyber

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,520
attacks because e-commerce platform deal

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,500
with sensitive information like name

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,920
address and banking details about 32.4

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,080
cyber attacks are targeted towards

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,079
e-commerce making it the most attacked

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,260
industry in February of this year about

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,780
500 e-commerce companies were attacked

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,640
on a single day due to vulnerabilities

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,579
in an outdated software this motivates

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,440
us to understand the current state of

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,600
e-commerce platforms both from an

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,059
academic and a practical perspective on

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,460
the privacy and security fronts

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
for this we conducted a two-phase study

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,379
we first performed a literature review

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,379
of 90 existing academic papers where we

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,899
identified five themes based on our

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,640
findings we conducted a large scale

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,119
analysis of 91 e-commerce websites where

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,460
we first analyzed the privacy policy and

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,680
browser cookies followed by a manual

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
analysis of key security indicators of

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,420
the websites our literature review

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,820
highlighted a skew in existing papers

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,220
where most Focus was laid on payment

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,259
platform architecture and leased on

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,960
authentication this motivated us to

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,780
perform the second phase of our study to

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,580
conduct an analysis of the Privacy

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,979
policies of the websites we use the

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,439
Privacy check browser extension tool

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,020
this tool identified the key details of

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,840
policies under two broad categories user

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,180
control and gdpr each with 10

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,119
subcategories the subcategories under

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,579
user control receive a score of either 0

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,000
5 or 10 and those under gdpr received a

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
score of 0 or 10. for cookie analysis we

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
used a free online tool named cookie

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,979
serve which reported on the number of

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,320
necessary analytics functional

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,479
performance advertisement and other

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,340
uncategorized cookies

49
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,679
finally for a manual analysis of the

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,959
websites we first look for indicators

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,000
for secure encryption by looking for

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,819
presence of https in the URL and a

53
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,440
digital certificate

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,540
then we check whether the website

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,760
allowed for guest checkout and provided

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,040
multi-factor Authentication

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,200
let me check the payment security of the

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,959
website by looking for association with

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,060
recognized payment processor or

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,220
financial institution and requirement

61
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,340
for an electronic signature lastly we

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,780
checked if the website validated

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,180
sensitive inputs such as address and

64
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,879
card information

65
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,500
across all the websites we noticed that

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,260
the most cookies were categorized as

67
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,720
others indicating that they did not fall

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,760
under any of the predefined categories

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,220
only 10 percent of the cookies were

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,099
deemed to be necessary and only 11 were

71
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,780
labeled as functional

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,420
our privacy policy analysis showed that

73
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,940
across all websites the policies that

74
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,680
received the least score under user

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,720
control category were related to users

76
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,180
ability to opt out after change in

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,700
privacy policy sharing users information

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,459
with law enforcement sharing of users

79
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,800
information with for marketing and

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
sharing of aggregated data based on

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,560
users Identity or behavior under gdpr

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,900
none of the Soviet website outline

83
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,360
policies for notifying the users in case

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,599
of a breach from a manual analysis we

85
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,459
saw that while almost all websites

86
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,280
provided basic authentication only a

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,959
little more than third allowed for guest

88
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,659
checkup address verification secure

89
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,280
payment and electronic signature

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,200
features were available in more than 80

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,080
percent of the websites all the surveyed

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,420
website verified car details and had a

93
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,340
digital certificate

94
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,099
so what does all this mean from our

95
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,440
study we notice a disparity between

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
security and privacy aspect of

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,000
e-commerce websites where both the

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,280
literature review and website analysis

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,500
indicated a greater focus on security

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,739
than privacy from a literature review we

101
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,060
know that there is a need for

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,159
simplifying policies and cookies for the

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
user finally to help with this we

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,019
propose a step-by-step method for

105
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,238
website analysis just as we have

106
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,520
followed for our study which can enable

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,280
users to make informed decisions

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,040
from here our next step is to expand

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,380
this study towards the equally important

110
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,020
e-payment platforms by looking at app

111
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,780
reviews from user perspective followed

112
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,660
by a technical evaluation of 50 Mobile

113
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,940
payment applications

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,100
with this I would like to thank you all

115
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,139
for listening and would be happy to have

116
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,900
engaging conversations on this topic

117
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,219
thank you once again
