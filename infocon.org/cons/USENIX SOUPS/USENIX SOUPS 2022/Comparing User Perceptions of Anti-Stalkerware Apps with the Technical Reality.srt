1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,919
Center

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,420
together with my colleagues from umio

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,720
University and teovin we investigated

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,119
security perceptions of anti-stock away

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,820
apps and compared them with the app's

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,539
actual abilities

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
so users face a problem of choice when

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
you search for anti-stock aware on the

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
Google Play Store you find at least 147

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,879
different apps with 50 000 downloads or

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,040
more

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,860
so as users have to decide somehow which

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,200
fulfills their security requirements but

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,960
we also know that on Android what apps

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,760
can see about other apps behavior is

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,460
very limited so we

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,539
assumed that some form of misconceptions

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,579
would be involved in this evaluation of

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,600
security

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,220
we wanted to investigate these

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,280
misconceptions to maybe improve decision

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,760
support and help users choose secure

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
apps

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
so how did we do that so we chose two

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,040
case study apps anti-spy Mobile Pro and

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,460
look at mobile and we use the app store

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,040
reviews to understand how users

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,159
communicated their trust in the app

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,759
and this works so many of these reviews

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,460
actually talk about privacy and security

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,640
things about the apps some also about

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
payment issues but there's lots of

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,020
information industry use and then

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,720
afterwards we looked at the apps

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,939
themselves

37
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,060
so we use cognitive walkthroughs to

38
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,280
understand how the apps user interaction

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,759
Works under regular use and also during

40
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,700
simulated security incidents so when we

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,280
installed stock aware on the phones

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,399
and then we also use static and dynamic

43
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,500
program analysis to understand the app's

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,419
actual detection mechanisms so what they

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,520
do to decide if something is a stock way

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,879
or not

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,400
so after our review analysis we found

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,819
five approaches of how users Enchanted

49
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,480
trust into Apps one of them was by

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
experiencing potentially harmful

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,720
incidents

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
so some of them were very positive so oh

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,459
this app saved me from this incident

54
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,980
somewhere also very negative so oh no my

55
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,480
app should have noticed this but it

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
didn't

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,920
um but the latter one was rather rare

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,360
because you actually need to know it at

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,860
the under attack

60
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,019
uh one also very common one was

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,959
reassuring user experiences so when

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,300
users straight up said it feels like a

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,920
guardian angel I feel secure

64
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,879
um also

65
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,580
some users build trust over time so

66
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,580
after a period of no major incidents

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,519
they said oh yeah this is a good sign or

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
also sometimes this is a bad sign it

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,300
should have found something

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,940
some users also straight up tested the

71
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,680
app's ability said oh no it didn't

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,319
detect so they installed stock aware and

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
said oh no it didn't detect this one

74
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,980
this app is trash

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,260
and very few actually use third-party

76
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,019
recommendations meaning getting advice

77
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,720
from family members who were I.T Savvy

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,540
or one actually used

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,640
a navigation from a magazine

80
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,500
so when we use the when we conducted the

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,260
cognitive walkthrough so in the

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,319
incidence of potentially harmful

83
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,379
uh security

84
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,060
incidents and we found that there was

85
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,980
often a lack of information about

86
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,480
consequences

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,819
so I didn't really say what kind of

88
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,739
effect on my life this would have if

89
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,720
this app would stay there and also a

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,580
lack of reaction option so very often it

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,760
was just the install or ignore which in

92
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,459
the use case of stock aware is sometimes

93
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,319
not what you want

94
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,680
and on the regular use especially if you

95
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,720
look at mobile we found lots of positive

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,239
feedback and also immediate feedback on

97
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,220
user interaction so when users did

98
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,959
something and immediately got feedback

99
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
this can help support mental models of

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,340
what's going on and one thing that I

101
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,340
especially liked was look at permanent

102
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,919
notification that everything is okay

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,280
and during our static and dynamic

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,979
program analysis we found how they

105
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,259
actually detected these stock rats and

106
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,320
and display Mobile Pro use the package

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,740
based block list approach which is a

108
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,720
faultier approach since on Android you

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,120
can just

110
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,620
decide which package name you want to

111
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,520
use

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,979
and in addition to that they also use

113
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,380
the heuristic based on app permissions

114
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,979
so if you got several permissions in

115
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,620
your app they said oh this is possibly a

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,040
buyable spyware application which is

117
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,340
also why signal is triggers this

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,560
heuristic

119
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,320
um and this block list does not get

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,199
updated during use you actually have to

121
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,419
update the app to get updated

122
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,060
information about which apps are blocked

123
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,500
look at mobile there's a bit more

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,240
sophisticated it collects information

125
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,820
from the package manager creates a

126
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,560
signature out of that and compares the

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,479
different local database and this

128
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,720
database is regularly updated uh to

129
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
bring use from a server I think once or

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,479
twice a day

131
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,500
so what we found is that user security

132
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,979
perceptions is mostly not related to the

133
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,960
actual detection abilities the only

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,820
approach where these two things connect

135
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,180
is when users personally test these

136
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,580
abilities by installing stockholen I

137
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,680
think this is one of the major ways we

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
could try to improve user users decision

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,979
um by helping support that

140
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,440
and we also found that user experience

141
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,900
of these talk away apps really affects

142
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,780
these perception perceptions and also

143
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,300
their choice so that is actually a call

144
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,520
for us to really invest more time in

145
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,020
designing that and thinking about how

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,180
the user experience may affect what

147
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,800
users think

148
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,660
but which also brings us to the problem

149
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,880
of potential security theater because

150
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,860
it's very easy to just have a permanent

151
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,419
notification that says everything is

152
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,240
okay but not actually doing anything

153
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:43,560
uh yeah and we recommend that these apps

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,259
maybe provide more context

155
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,580
context-specific advice and give users

156
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,280
more agency apart from the installing or

157
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,419
ignoring

158
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,340
we thought it would be really awesome if

159
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,319
we could find ways to demonstrate

160
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,080
stockway detection abilities to users

161
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,360
we're not entirely sure on how to do

162
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
that maybe with some kind of test kit so

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,479
that users not only get an impression

164
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120
how good this detection works but also

165
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,180
how it works when something is detected

166
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,400
and lastly we should not forget

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
um operating systems still have a lot of

168
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,780
power on which stock aware works on a

169
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,139
mobile phone or not and we need to

170
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,660
leverage these abilities more so that we

171
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,580
reduce the problem of actually having

172
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,599
stock Orient phones

173
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,479
so to summarize

174
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,780
we analyzed users perception with App

175
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,599
Store reviews we analyzed how the app

176
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
works with cognitive walkthroughs and

177
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,099
program analysis and we hope that our

178
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,340
findings help decision support

179
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,800
um that we in future may be design

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,860
better secure experiences and also call

181
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,840
for a better operating system

182
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360
limitations for stock aware

183
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
so yeah check out our full paper there's

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,880
link you can find me also on the hallway

185
