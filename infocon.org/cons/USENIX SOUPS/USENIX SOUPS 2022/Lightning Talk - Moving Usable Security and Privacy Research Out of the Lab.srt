1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,260
my name is Florian and I'm trying to

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,420
establish using virtual reality as a

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,400
research method in usable security and

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
privacy and I will just talk you a bit

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,859
about you know the idea of using VR

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,140
studies for the research we do within

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,699
our community

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,400
so on the plane to soups I had a yeah on

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
the plane to Boston to zoops right I had

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,660
a look at the proceedings last year I

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,700
wanted to see what research methods do

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,440
we actually use in our research right

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,100
and not surprisingly out of 36 accepted

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,280
papers last year more than 20 used

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,379
online service right so online servers

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,200
are great we can reach a lot of people

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,480
from different countries it's very

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,280
affordable actually to recruit people

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,460
and we can you know click go to bed

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,140
eight hours later we probably have a

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,719
huge sample right next to online service

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,579
we have lots of different research

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,760
methods ranging from interview studies

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,459
to lab studies to ethnographical studies

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,619
and so on so there is a lot of stuff out

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,380
there now talking about usable security

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,619
and privacy research in the lab I just

29
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,299
picked some random examples here you

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,100
know these are all great works which

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,799
basically propose a novel usable secured

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,200
in privacy prototype and they do some

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,659
user testing in the lab and often that

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,299
actually involves physical hardware and

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,299
you know

36
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,159
participants need to commute to the lab

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,340
to interact with this with these systems

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,680
the problem here is that

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,200
um two years ago I did an interview

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,479
study with uh with a few experts from

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,939
our community and the reality is

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,000
actually if we do such studies you know

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
we are recruiting participants by

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,840
knocking on the doors of friends and

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,119
colleagues and be like hey you know come

46
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,740
and do my user study I will give you 10

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,659
right this is reality actually this is

48
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,119
how people recruit participants and it's

49
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,119
really sad because also sometimes the

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,460
research we do is based on the hardware

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,038
we have available right and I thought

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,500
about okay you know how can we support

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,560
and facilitate researchers in the

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,599
research we do and you know push forward

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,260
this in in the space we are working in

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,200
so what I propose here is basically uh

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,940
instead of having the reality and

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,040
conducting user research in the lab with

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
physical Hardware we can basically

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,879
replicate that into a virtual

61
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,319
environment which we call virtual

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,300
reality right so virtual reality is

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,040
nothing else that basically immersing

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
users into a virtual environment and

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,420
letting them interact and experience a

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400
virtual replication for example of a

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,340
real world space this basically means we

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,620
can create virtual replicas of lab

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,840
environments right so we can still you

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,180
know put users into a lab Environ

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,640
environment and evaluate our in this

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,099
case authentication method but we can

73
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,980
also create more realistic experiences

74
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,220
in this example here we replicated an

75
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,560
ATM and we went through an ATM

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,540
authentication process and we let

77
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
participants withdraw cash so why is

78
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,819
this important so first of all

79
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,459
um security is never a primary task

80
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,400
right so when you go to an ATM your aim

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
is to withdraw cash but you need to go

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,959
through an authentication and in in such

83
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,480
a way we can basically simulate a more

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
realistic authentication environment in

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,860
the lab through the help of virtual

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,220
reality so we in this uh virtual

87
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,099
environment here you can see a user one

88
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,319
of our participants interacting with an

89
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,000
ATM and we evaluate the novel

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,580
authentication system but the way in how

91
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,040
we present the authentication system is

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,200
more realistic than you know coming to a

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,120
physical lab sitting in front of a PC

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,000
and then you know authenticating so this

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,180
is actually what we can make here to

96
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,819
really support more realistic usable

97
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,519
security research in the lab so another

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,980
thing why this is important so I picked

99
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,080
here two papers one from the look at all

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,120
and one from Volcom at all and if you

101
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,980
have a look at these papers both

102
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,280
published at soups uh you know in 2010

103
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,659
and 2018

104
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,760
they try to understand how people

105
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,180
interact and behave in front of ATMs the

106
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,858
challenge here is that if you do this in

107
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,478
the wild you need to consider a lot of

108
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,940
ethical and legal considerations which

109
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,220
makes it super challenging to conduct

110
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,380
that type of research right but what if

111
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,020
we can move that type of research into

112
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,400
the lab through the help of virtual

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,100
reality because simply asking uh you

114
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,320
know Financial Industries industry

115
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,540
Partners to get access to the ATM is

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,639
probably not happening right

117
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,240
um

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,160
so now svr or you know using VR um you

119
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,740
know the golden future of what we do no

120
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,500
obviously not right but what I want to

121
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,620
um say here is basically we have this

122
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,900
usable privacy and security research in

123
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,120
the lab right and we move that online

124
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,160
through the help of online surveys we

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,100
deployed apks

126
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,139
we conduct browser-based studies and

127
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,060
that's a huge success right that really

128
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,460
forged forward the research we do and

129
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,699
you know as redmart says online surveys

130
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,100
or interviews those are key techniques

131
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,259
to understand and you know improve how

132
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,560
human decisions making affect security

133
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,880
so maybe also you know as part is like a

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,380
small bit of the research we're doing

135
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,240
the lab is actually research that

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,220
involves hardware and also to understand

137
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,620
how people interact with novel usable

138
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,720
security and privacy systems so maybe we

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,539
can use here VR as a research method to

140
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,039
make the same step we did with online

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,020
service right we could transition that

142
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,720
online as well because these days

143
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,000
millions of people have access to

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,820
Virtual Reality headsets right so if you

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,800
conduct a user study on a smartphone for

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
example you could do the same now with

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
virtual reality headsets almost 15

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Millions have access to an Oculus Quest

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,100
2 device right and I mean there is a lot

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,960
of interest these days

151
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,460
so finally

152
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,620
um I just want to conclude with with a

153
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,620
question and maybe uh you know we as a

154
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,419
community start thinking about how can

155
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,419
we now make use of Novel technology to

156
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,100
you know support and facilitate

157
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,800
researchers and maybe other transition

158
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,780
um our Research into practice in the end

159
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,759
so you know maybe you can think about

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,039
this question uh review our specific

161
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,680
research field it might be suitable to

162
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,199
use VR it might not be suitable and I

163
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,240
think you know having access to more

164
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,919
research methods

165
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,020
um Beyond um you know more traditional

166
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,840
ones can be a way to really push forward

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,840
the research we do thanks a lot I also

168
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,280
want to thank all the institutions

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,319
