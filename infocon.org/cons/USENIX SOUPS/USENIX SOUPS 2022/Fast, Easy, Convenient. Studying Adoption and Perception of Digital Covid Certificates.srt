1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,619
hello everyone my name is Marvin and I'm

3
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,119
a PhD student from the Royal University

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,400
Boulevard Germany and my main research

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,019
area is human centered security and

6
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,960
privacy of covid-19 apps

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,580
today I have the pleasure to present our

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,500
paper in which we studied the adoption

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
and end user's perception of digital

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,399
covet certificates

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,440
some of you may be wondering what are

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,480
covet certificates so let me briefly

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,040
explain the path to covet certificates

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,500
and their purpose

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,719
in many countries we had again and again

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,219
increasing infection numbers due to

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,719
covet 19.

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,280
and these eventually led to the fact

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,020
that we have had recurring lockdowns and

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,640
other restrictions

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
and to mitigate the effects of the

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
spreading coronavirus and to gradually

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
reopen the country but at the same time

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
hopefully preventing further lockdowns

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
covid-19 specific access restrictions

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,159
were introduced in some countries such

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,320
as Germany requiring to prove that

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,299
you're either being fully vaccinated

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,939
recovered from covid-19 or by providing

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,799
a negative test result and for this

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,960
purpose paper-based or digitally covered

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,400
certificates are needed

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,520
in these certificates paper or apps must

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,460
be easily verifiable but secure

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,259
we believe that digital corporate

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,759
certificates provide an interesting

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,740
showcase to investigate health related

38
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,540
privacy in an everyday application that

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,340
is widely used by broad audience with

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,960
exceptional use case of the copied 19

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,520
pandemic

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,900
this emerging field of application

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,880
motivated us to take a deeper look at

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,320
the adoption and the end user's

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
perception of paper-based and digital

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,619
Health certificates specifically

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,659
tailored for kovite 19.

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,340
and we also wanted to investigate

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,020
whether there are any misunderstandings

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,880
about the verification process of

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,740
app-based solutions that Implement a QR

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,460
code

53
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,200
especially because these QR codes

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,540
contain sensitive personal Health Data

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,500
well sorry

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,640
to better understand the context of our

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,079
study and to motivate the reason to

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,640
conduct our study in a European country

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
in Germany I would like to give a short

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,979
overview about the context of our study

61
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,720
in Germany we had the first lockdown at

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,220
the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic

63
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,620
in 2020 followed by the second one

64
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,660
starting in 2021

65
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,340
as Germany headed for the next lockdown

66
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,680
in the fall of 2021 there were

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,420
discussions in between which ultimately

68
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,739
led to the measure to implement access

69
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,720
restrictions not only in Germany but

70
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,879
also in other countries worldwide

71
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,300
so covet certificates are needed

72
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,620
let's briefly talk about the different

73
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,300
covet certificate variants used in

74
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,860
Germany

75
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,959
the first one is dedicated kof Pass App

76
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,700
implementing the European digital covet

77
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,040
certificate a QR code that can be easily

78
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,900
verified by scanning with a verify app

79
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,480
to check the covet status

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,459
this app

81
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,800
cryptographically time QR code can be

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,540
used throughout Europe

83
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,220
the second one is the so-called

84
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,019
coronavan app extended by the covet

85
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,940
certificate feature and this

86
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,220
multi-future app was originally designed

87
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,840
for contact tracing only

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,739
and finally the international

89
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,780
certificates of vaccination documents

90
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,920
standardized by the World Health

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,319
Organization which has already been used

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,720
for documentation purposes of any kind

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,840
of vaccination and to prove your

94
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,340
vaccination status for example when

95
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,180
traveling internationally

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
okay our study design I said we

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,500
conducted an end user study in Germany

98
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,480
but actually our study consists of three

99
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,459
methods of Parts each conducted in

100
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,980
December 2021

101
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,420
a census representative online

102
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,940
questionnaire with 800 participants 30

103
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,560
Short Street interviews with employees

104
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,540
and random sampling of the digital

105
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,480
verification process

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
our online questionnaire was intended to

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,540
gain insights into the end user's

108
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,640
attitudes their motivations and

109
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,319
potential factors influencing the

110
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,360
adoption and use of digital of

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,099
paper-based and digital covert

112
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,840
certificates

113
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,400
we also asked our participants to

114
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,780
describe how their certificate was

115
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,940
verified as well as indicating the ease

116
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,459
of use and effort

117
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,959
to evaluate the knowledge and

118
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,000
misconceptions they rate correct and

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
fault statements about QR codes in

120
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,780
general and QR codes tailored for the

121
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,040
covet certificate app context

122
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,299
the Short Street interviews expand our

123
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,358
research to the views of employees who

124
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,040
are obligated to verify these covert

125
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,180
certificates

126
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,800
for this purpose three researchers

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
conducted interviews with a variety of

128
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,139
business sectors

129
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,340
we also wanted to gain insights into how

130
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,199
the verification process of digital

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,300
covet certificates is carried out in the

132
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,759
wild and likewise three researchers

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,560
entered a total of 80 stars and

134
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,080
businesses so we only observed the

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,699
correctness of the verification process

136
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,500
and distinguished between five different

137
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,180
verification level

138
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,520
in fact verification level 5 scaling the

139
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,800
QR code and match the personal data is

140
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,479
the only correct way to verify a

141
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,280
citizen's covet status and is apparently

142
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,380
the most secure and privacy friendly way

143
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,800
to do so

144
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,580
finally I would like to give you a rough

145
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,199
overview of the main results of our

146
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,440
paper

147
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,940
in our online question there are 77 of

148
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,919
our participants state that they use an

149
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,540
app variant to prove their covet status

150
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,120
whereas only 20 indicate to use a

151
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,860
paper-based certificate

152
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,840
so the acceptance rate of app-based

153
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
certificates is high which differs from

154
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,979
our previous work finding that only 37

155
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,620
of our participants are willing to use

156
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,919
the digital certificate while 44 prefer

157
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,020
a PayPal version

158
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,699
but this previous work only surveyed

159
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,740
usage intention of hypothetical mock-up

160
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,960
implementations not actually usage

161
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,160
we also asked our participants to raise

162
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
the perceived effort to use covet

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,340
certificates as an everyday life

164
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,220
application on a five-point scale

165
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,160
in case of apps 70 assess the required

166
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
effort to be on one of the lowest two

167
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,180
levels that is not effortful only a

168
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,100
little effortful

169
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,720
so the overall perceived effort in daily

170
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,460
use seems to be rather low which is

171
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,479
especially true for apps

172
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,039
in total we found four predictors that

173
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,780
significantly influence the adoption of

174
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,520
digital covet certificates in an either

175
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,740
positive or negative way

176
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,479
the ABS ease of use is the only

177
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,580
significant predictor that increases the

178
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,320
odds to use apps

179
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,060
another significant but hindering

180
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,800
predictor are privacy concerns related

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
to apps that means participants with

182
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,240
higher privacy concerns so more privacy

183
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
cautious Behavior are less likely to use

184
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,660
an app

185
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,759
the same applies for people who are not

186
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,680
or do not plan to get vaccinated or

187
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,600
elderly people in general so these

188
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,460
groups are also less likely to use apps

189
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,300
we also viewed our participants

190
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,699
open-ended responses in fact we asked

191
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,560
them why they prefer to use either

192
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,319
paper-based certificate or an app

193
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,460
in terms of apps a total of 268 out of

194
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,440
529 participants argue that they carry

195
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,340
the smartphone with them anyway

196
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,620
234 use an app due to its ease of use so

197
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,660
users seem to think that the easiest and

198
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,520
most convenient way to indicate their

199
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,740
vaccination recovery or test status is

200
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,240
using a corresponding app which they

201
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,940
naturally carry with them anyway

202
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,620
some participants even mentioned the

203
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,539
increased security due to the use of

204
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,759
cryptographically signed QR codes or the

205
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,300
lower probability of hex certificates

206
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,699
on the other hand about 25 participants

207
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,380
who prefer a paper-based certificate

208
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,900
argue with ease of use or security and

209
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,000
privacy concerns

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,900
um

211
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,240
but mostly referring to drawbacks of

212
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,620
apps

213
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,880
some participants are afraid of

214
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
technical issues for example during the

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
verification process are caused by fears

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
over their smartphones low battery level

217
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,160
concerning access restrictions for some

218
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,960
parts of public life 80 of the

219
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,460
participants are in favor of

220
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,560
restrictions with major events and

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
International Air traveling being the

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
most frequently mentioned ones

223
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,440
so it seems that users favor

224
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,180
restrictions for exceptional purposes

225
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,639
and tend to prefer the use of app-based

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
certificates of our paper-based ones for

227
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,880
these access restrictions

228
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
a few words about the verification

229
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,560
process of QR code based certificates

230
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,660
in the online questionnaire only 34

231
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,340
participants of users state that the

232
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,620
verification process was carried out

233
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,300
correctly

234
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,039
in case of the Short Street interviews

235
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,039
37 of employees indicate that they scan

236
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,020
the QR code and match the show on

237
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,879
personal information

238
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,620
our own sampling of the verification

239
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,720
process was somewhat higher and showed

240
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,240
that in 50 of all cases the verification

241
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
process was performed indeed correctly

242
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,299
in our online questionnaire we also

243
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,099
found numerous misconceptions regarding

244
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,539
the digital verification process

245
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,299
including statements like the QR code is

246
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,979
not allowed to be a photo or screenshot

247
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,260
it must be presented with an official

248
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,660
app which could be verified by scrolling

249
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,399
up and down in the app

250
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,399
but at least 65 of the participants knew

251
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,500
that you're not supposed to share a

252
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,959
screenshot or a photo of your QR code

253
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,100
display and review the answers we

254
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
gathered in the street interviews with

255
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,399
employees we also found several

256
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,959
misconceptions

257
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
some employees thought that scrolling up

258
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
and down in someone else's personal

259
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,839
smartphone app would ensure that the

260
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,940
certificate is real and some even added

261
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,620
that the QR code isn't helpful for them

262
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,700
okay let's finally conclude our results

263
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,339
many German citizens seems to be in

264
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,019
favor of the measures for some purposes

265
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,420
and use cases at least none of these

266
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,100
exceptional circumstances related to the

267
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,779
covid-19 pandemic

268
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,339
app-based certificates are clearly

269
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,380
preferred by our participants over any

270
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,080
kind of paper-based solutions

271
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,339
essentially due to the ease of use low

272
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,320
effort and convenience

273
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
but there are many misconceptions and

274
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,399
knowledge gaps on both sides several end

275
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,899
users are not aware of the functionality

276
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,640
of QR codes

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,380
which we suppose may also be a

278
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,700
consequence of different application

279
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,480
areas for QR codes in general

280
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,519
and employers who are obliged to verify

281
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,750
the covet status are not aware of

282
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,240
[Music]

283
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,519
the security and privacy related

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,500
processes of scanning cryptographically

285
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,339
signed QR codes

286
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,240
thank you for your attention and I'm

287
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,560
happy to hear your questions
