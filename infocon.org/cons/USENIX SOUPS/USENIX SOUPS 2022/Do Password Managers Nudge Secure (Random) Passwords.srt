foreign

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,300
it's my pleasure to have a chance to

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,460
talk about our research on due password

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,740
managers not just secure passwords

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,840
password authentication Still Remains

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
widespread although it has security and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,279
memorability concerns and the number of

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,380
passwords that each individual has to

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,660
remember is increasing day by day

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,000
previous studies showed that the average

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,200
person has 26 to 100 accounts the burden

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,420
of remembering all these passwords often

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,399
causes users to use some insecure

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,399
methods such as reusing one password for

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,620
multiple accounts

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,620
password managers are instrumental tool

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,200
to help users create a long random and

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,460
unique password with a password

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,460
generator and save passwords for each of

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,680
their accounts the password manager

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,219
stores the password using encrypted

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,739
although using a passport manager is

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,619
highly recommended by security expert it

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,900
is still not adopted by many users and

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,700
those that do often don't use the

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,200
password generator

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
so how to encourage use of the randomly

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
generated password

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,299
one technique that can be used is

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,820
nudging nudging is a Behavioral Science

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,920
technique that influences people's

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,900
decision without limiting their choices

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,600
in this context nothing is used to

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,119
influence adoption of randomly generated

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,820
passwords without limiting user choices

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,000
such as reusing a password or creating a

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,420
week and easy to remember password

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,240
some browsers building password managers

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,460
such as Chrome Firefox and Safari

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,140
employing not just at the time of

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,540
passport creation to persuade users to

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,159
accept using a randomly generated

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,180
password

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,119
but little is known about which designs

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
are most effective

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,740
let's take a closer look at each of the

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,259
nudges of these browsers when a user

48
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,899
clicks on a password field Chrome uses a

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,300
simple just in time not encouraging

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,879
users to accept the 15 character random

51
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,900
password

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,720
zooming in on the interface we can see

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,760
that Chrome emphasizes convenience

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,800
rather than security through this

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,200
statement you won't have to remember it

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,780
also it doesn't seek to grab users

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,280
attention

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,040
Firefox uses a similar Notch to Chrome

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,860
but with different wording it uses a

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,560
word securely to emphasize security and

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,640
convenience as well

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,920
software uses another type of nut which

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,620
is called a default match default nudges

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,200
work by selecting the desired option by

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,900
default so Safari automatically

66
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
populates an 18 character password by

67
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,180
default for the user also software does

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,099
something more by displaying a pop-up

69
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,220
message at the time of password creation

70
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,440
emphasizing both on password strengths

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,780
and convenience

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,959
in this research we aim to find how do

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
the three most popular browser-based

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,459
password managers including Chrome

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,739
Firefox and Safari compared to each

76
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,319
other in nursing users to adopt randomly

77
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
generated passwords

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,319
also we investigate the factors that

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,360
might contribute to randomly generated

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,940
password adoption factors such as

81
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,340
noticing the nudge having experience

82
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,260
using password manager and password

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,700
generator and website's password policy

84
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,060
and finally what are the rationals of

85
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,879
users to use or not use a randomly

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,700
generated password

87
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,860
protect our participants to the

88
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,739
Mechanical Turk website our studies

89
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,299
conducted with three groups of

90
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,700
participants one group for Chrome one

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,599
for Firefox and one for Safari we use a

92
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,700
user agent header to determine the

93
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,400
correct browser in use

94
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
participants were only able to sign up

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,540
once in our study we implemented two

96
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,819
password policies in our study including

97
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,480
1c8 and 3c12 participants in each group

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
were randomly assigned to one of the two

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,380
policies

100
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,139
now I'd like to talk about our study

101
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,860
design in Task 1 to ensure users didn't

102
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,840
have unrealistic focus on the password

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,020
generator we use a deceptive concern for

104
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,419
asking user to test our e-commerce

105
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,020
website's registration and login process

106
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,180
in task 2 practice passwords were

107
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,639
directed to our mock e-commerce website

108
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
to register

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,800
in task 3 we asked participants to

110
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,560
answer five demographic questions

111
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,139
in tasks for participants were asked to

112
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,940
log into the account they created in

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,500
task 2.

114
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,080
in Task 5 we asked some questions

115
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,960
regarding users Behavior toward nudges

116
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,460
and their feedback

117
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,520
and in task 6 we reveal the actual

118
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,919
purpose of our study in the last consent

119
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,000
form

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,220
participants were given the chance to

121
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,259
withdraw and no information would be

122
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,880
recorded

123
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,340
here are some interesting results of our

124
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,419
study

125
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,060
we tested whether the randomly generated

126
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,639
password adoption rate differs between

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,220
three browsers we found that software

128
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,380
users were more likely to adopt a

129
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,419
randomly generated password and the

130
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,300
difference is significant

131
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,940
there are some possible reasons for this

132
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,400
software uses a default Notch which has

133
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,199
been found the most effective type of

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,139
nudge in many other application contexts

135
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,539
also software is not is more visually

136
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,780
striking than Chrome and Firefox

137
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,240
software uses color and face the last

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
six characters giving the impression

139
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,500
that the password might contain more

140
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,419
characters

141
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,360
it also provides some information in the

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,120
pop-up message about autofill and

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,900
storage features to educate users

144
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,600
it's interesting to note that more

145
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,699
software users reported that they

146
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,919
noticed a nudge by asking them in our

147
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,780
questioner did you notice the

148
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,880
recommendation to use a random password

149
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,219
while registering on our website

150
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,539
We examined the number of potential

151
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,699
factors that we hypothesized might

152
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,560
contribute to the adoption rate for

153
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,660
randomly generated passwords

154
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,180
we first try to find if there is a

155
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,400
significant difference between the

156
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,259
adoption of randomly generated password

157
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,240
and storage features between

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,520
participants who noticed the nudge and

159
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,039
those who didn't notice the knowledge we

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,660
found that participants who used

161
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,300
randomly generated password mostly

162
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,340
belong to the group of participants who

163
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,680
noticed the nudge and the difference is

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,460
significant

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,280
also in terms of remember password

166
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,800
feature participants will save their

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,900
password mostly belong to the group of

168
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,240
participants who noticed the nudge again

169
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,539
the difference is significance

170
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,120
we found that previous use of the

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,880
password generator influences users to

172
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,400
adopt randomly generated passwords in

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
our study however having experience

174
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,919
using a passport manager didn't seem

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
influencing users to adopt randomly

176
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,159
generated passwords

177
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,319
if a participants regularly uses a

178
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,120
browser it is possible that they are

179
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,740
used to the nudge and it may be less

180
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,380
effective for them however we found no

181
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,840
significant difference between users who

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,180
uses this floor the daily and those who

183
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,580
use their non-day browsers in our study

184
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,860
in terms of accepting randomly generated

185
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,580
passwords

186
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,520
another interesting result in our study

187
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,340
is that after bonfernee correction there

188
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,740
is no significant difference between the

189
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,380
two websites password policies in terms

190
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,440
of influencing users to adopt a randomly

191
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,280
generated password

192
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,860
we asked participants to describe the

193
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,020
reason that they used or didn't use a

194
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,840
randomly generated password in our study

195
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,900
We performed a qualitative analysis on

196
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,400
the responses

197
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,520
two researchers did emergent coding and

198
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,280
to verify the reliability of our coding

199
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,240
process we used Cohen's Capital test

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,000
the three main reasons for rejecting the

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
randomly generated password and using a

202
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
self-chosen password instead where

203
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,958
memorability issues their preference to

204
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,059
use their own password and the fact that

205
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,700
they didn't notice the merge and the

206
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,860
three main reasons for adopting the

207
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,899
randomly generated password were

208
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,360
reported as their convenience security

209
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,899
and the remember password feature

210
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,660
our research provides lots of useful

211
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,459
information on the efficiency of

212
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,440
randomly generated password not just

213
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
entry browsers that can be used to

214
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,640
inform future work in this area

215
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,040
our study also supports that some

216
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,260
factors might contribute to the adoption

217
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,720
of randomly generated passwords

218
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,420
our finding can be useful for future

219
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,640
password manager Notch designs and

220
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,680
intervention in terms of encouraging

221
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,620
users to adopt password manager use

222
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,260
future work includes investigating

223
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,300
richer design elements are most

224
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,360
impactful in software's nudge also

225
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,880
investigating how to improve passport

226
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,760
manager not just further for example by

227
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,300
using other nudging techniques or by

228
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,320
personalizing nudges

229
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,080
thanks for being here today I'm looking

230
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,300
forward to receiving your follow-up

231
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,599
