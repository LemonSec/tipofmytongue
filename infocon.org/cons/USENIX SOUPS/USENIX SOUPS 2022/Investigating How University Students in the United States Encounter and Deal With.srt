1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,500
hi everyone I'm Kevin I'm a rising

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,880
second year PhD student at the

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,799
University of Washington and today I'm

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,480
very excited to be presenting some work

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,720
on covid-19 misinformation Encounters in

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,699
private WhatsApp chats from the

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,560
perspective of University students in

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,720
the U.S and this was work that I

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
completed while I was an undergrad at

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,240
Princeton with some fantastic

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,560
collaborators here from the University

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,038
of Chicago

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
okay I want to start off by making the

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,640
following claim which is that

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,980
misinformation on WhatsApp is a unique

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,840
socio-technical challenge

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,239
because not only do we have the

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,040
technical challenges associated with

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
moderating content and end-to-end

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,879
encrypted environments but we also have

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,739
Social Challenges arising from

23
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,140
particular group chat Dynamics due to

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,879
how the platform is often used here in

25
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,140
the US

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,739
and I make that claim because we studied

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,539
how University students in the U.S

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,820
responded to covet related

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,500
misinformation and private WhatsApp

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,840
chats between family and friends and

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,400
through our findings I will further

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
illustrate this claim for you

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
but just to step back and motivate our

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,939
work a little bit I'm sure at this point

35
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,799
we're all too familiar with this term

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
but early on in the pandemic the World

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,960
Health Organization actually declared

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,360
covid-19 to be an infodemic in addition

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,520
to a pandemic so what did they mean by

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,759
this

41
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,979
and so the who defines infodemic as an

42
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,680
overabundance of information including

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,420
deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,159
information and this can be in both

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,560
online and offline settings but if we

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,860
consider the online case specifically we

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,900
quickly quickly realized that the

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,939
barrier to publishing content on social

49
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,979
media has gotten so low that false

50
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,140
information can spread much faster than

51
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,420
something like the virus itself and this

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,220
is especially true if a platform is

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,560
designed for the quick distribution of

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
information such as WhatsApp

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,960
and I know many of you in this room may

56
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,060
use Twitter and see that as a hub where

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,979
information

58
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,080
gets distributed around very quickly but

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,239
what you may be surprised to find is

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,099
that a similar percentage of Americans

61
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,140
actually say they use WhatsApp compared

62
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,860
to Twitter at least in this 2021 study

63
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,620
distributed by the Pew Research Center

64
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,319
at the uses usage scenarios for the two

65
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,840
apps can be quite different and so it

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,599
turns out that many immigrants in the US

67
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,459
actually use WhatsApp to communicate

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,620
with family and friends back home as

69
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,180
well as to connect with their immigrant

70
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
communities here within the U.S

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,540
um and one big selling point for the app

72
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,940
besides it being very Global is its

73
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,580
commitment to security so all messages

74
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,860
on the platform are are guaranteed to be

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,420
end and end encrypted and this actually

76
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,920
has some pretty interesting implications

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,260
on how the platform can moderate content

78
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,180
and that's actually one of the reasons

79
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,400
why we're so interested in WhatsApp in

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
particular

81
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,260
and so understandably misinformation in

82
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,200
WhatsApp is a tricky problem and it has

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,180
attracted a lot of attention from the

84
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,940
research community so far but previous

85
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,220
work in the space typically focuses on

86
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,560
these large public groups where data is

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
more accessible so with these public

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,580
groups anyone can join with an

89
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,459
invitation link so researchers can

90
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,860
simply go into these chats and with with

91
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,840
permission download the messages and

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
analyze them that way but from what we

93
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,940
know about how users actually use the

94
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,180
platform at least here in the US

95
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,860
WhatsApp may be used in these much more

96
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,780
intimate settings with family and

97
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,540
friends and misinformation Encounters in

98
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,519
these smaller private chats that are not

99
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,680
open to the public may be quite

100
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,180
different than than those same

101
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,280
Encounters in these larger public groups

102
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,260
so that brings us to the fundamental

103
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,299
question behind our study here which is

104
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,340
what can we learn from qualitative

105
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,680
explorations of misinformation in

106
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,659
private WhatsApp chats during the

107
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,519
covid-19 endemic

108
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,879
and here's what we did to answer that

109
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,560
first of all we acknowledge that

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,900
different misinformation experiences can

111
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,519
can come from different user

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,560
demographics so we decided to focus on

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,139
one demographic in particular we focused

114
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,139
on WhatsApp users in the US because the

115
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,380
US actually has the third largest user

116
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,240
base of WhatsApp in the world it's

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
around 70 million users I believe and

118
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,940
also the US is home to diverse groups of

119
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,340
immigrant communities and we decided to

120
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,080
focus on younger users out of some

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,360
previous work that showed this

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,220
unreciprocated concern that younger

123
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,380
Generations directed towards older

124
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,780
family members especially in the context

125
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,219
of covid-19 misinformation

126
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,199
um so what we did was we conducted 16

127
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,520
semi-structured virtual interviews with

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,620
University students in the U.S who also

129
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,020
happen to be regular WhatsApp users and

130
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,340
I'll note that even though our

131
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,960
participants are based in the US they

132
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,419
still communicated with both people

133
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,699
within the US and outside of the US and

134
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,380
many of our participants came from

135
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,419
immigrant communities and our

136
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,580
conversations revolved around three

137
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,860
topic categories there are General

138
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,139
WhatsApp usage there are experiences

139
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,820
encountering misinformation on the

140
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,400
platform as well as any fact checking

141
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,259
strategies they employed as well as any

142
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,720
higher level design recommendations that

143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,880
they had for the platform

144
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
and

145
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,539
we have a full list of findings that you

146
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,979
can check out in our paper but I'll just

147
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,020
highlight three of them here the first

148
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,759
is that misinformation and private

149
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,680
family and friends group chats is often

150
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,139
spread from sorry spread from good

151
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,120
intentions

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,460
and to set this up one of the first

153
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,020
things we notice while talking to

154
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,820
participants was how easy it was to

155
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,180
forward many messages to people to many

156
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,979
groups and people at once using

157
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,840
whatsapp's forwarding feature and almost

158
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,639
too easy in the words of this

159
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,100
participant and oftentimes this

160
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,960
forwarded content was actually meant to

161
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,360
be useful so this participant here got

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,639
the advice that they they should rinse

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,440
their nose with a saline solution to

164
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,479
prevent covet and even though this

165
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
advice might be completely useless in in

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,759
practice it's spread out of genuine

167
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,979
concern

168
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,320
and something else that we noticed was

169
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,139
the difference in mindsets between

170
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,900
misinformation senders and receivers so

171
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,400
this participant here when they were

172
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,360
talking about their mother

173
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,199
it was revealed that their mother

174
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,300
believed that the family should do

175
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,360
whatever they can to mitigate covid even

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,860
if that means spreading information

177
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,500
that's not necessarily true but also the

178
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,060
mother didn't consider it as

179
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,940
misinformation interestingly possibly

180
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,840
due to the benevolent intent behind it

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,819
and so related to the first point here

182
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,979
the intimacy that often comes with this

183
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,319
misinformation greatly complicates users

184
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,100
willingness and ability to deal with it

185
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,979
and this is perhaps best summarized by

186
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,660
by a quote from this participant here

187
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,240
who feels like the level of genuineness

188
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,180
adds added to the misinformation makes

189
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,919
it um you know difficult to deal with

190
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,620
and even causes people to panic and here

191
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,660
we see a real dissonance because users

192
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
tend to trust those who are close to

193
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,039
them such as older relatives and that's

194
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,840
why they're in these you know friends

195
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
and family group chats in the first

196
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,020
place but these are also the same people

197
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,479
who who they receive misinformation from

198
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,979
and something else that complicates this

199
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,620
is a cultural belief commonly mentioned

200
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,840
by our participants from immigrant

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,699
communities which is that correcting

202
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,560
older relatives is often seen as

203
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,900
disrespectful but older relatives are

204
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,280
also the ones who typically send

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,500
misinformation at least according to our

206
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,919
participants and this participant here

207
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,539
attributed that to the lack of

208
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,639
technological literacy

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,099
and as a result the misinformation sent

210
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,840
in these groups is typically ignored

211
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,120
rather than disputed and in the rare

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,819
case that active disputes did happen it

213
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,919
was typically between those of a similar

214
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,780
age range so for example participants

215
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,240
would talk about it with their siblings

216
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,979
or with family members who the

217
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,500
participant was very comfortable having

218
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,720
open conversations with such as parents

219
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,580
and so now that we know what kinds of

220
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,280
misinformation users encounter what do

221
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
participants think can be done about all

222
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,180
this and the answer is actually not that

223
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,220
much because many users see this

224
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,919
fundamental trade-off between the

225
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,780
Privacy commitments of the platform and

226
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,240
its ability to perform this stringent

227
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,940
content moderation

228
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,039
and we found that strict content

229
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,659
moderation can actually be seen as

230
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,640
infringing upon personal privacy on the

231
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,799
platform and that many participants

232
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,660
actually preferred it if WhatsApp did

233
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,620
not explicitly flag or censor content

234
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,740
and when when the platform did however

235
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,839
participants mentioned that uh you know

236
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,640
it's very important for WhatsApp to have

237
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,740
privacy focused messaging that should be

238
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,720
made very clear up front an example of

239
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,300
this would be something like disclosing

240
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,220
the Privacy preserving technique that's

241
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,980
used to flag messages and otherwise

242
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,200
participants suggested that WhatsApp can

243
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,300
just collect already known examples of

244
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,899
misinformation or are or already known

245
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,240
sources of misinformation and just send

246
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
it to users as a list for reference

247
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,980
and overall this trade-off actually

248
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,959
Echoes some interesting discussions in

249
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,700
the legal space about end-to-end

250
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,920
encryption and user protection so in

251
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,440
this 2019 letter to Facebook from

252
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,260
government officials in the UK U.S and

253
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,779
Australia is actually a requested that

254
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,519
Facebook does not Implement end-to-end

255
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,920
encryption across all of its messaging

256
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,839
services because that would sacrifice

257
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,620
user safety and now with this study we

258
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,060
know that this perceived trade-off is

259
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,860
not only seen by legal experts and

260
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,019
Technical experts but also everyday

261
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,399
WhatsApp users as well

262
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,440
okay so given these findings what can

263
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,480
WhatsApp and other NTN encrypted

264
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
messaging services do going forward we

265
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,860
have a full series of design

266
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,480
recommendations that will invite you to

267
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
check out in our paper but I'll just

268
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,860
outline a couple broad directions here

269
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,160
the first is so if you recall it can be

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,500
challenging for users to correct others

271
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,140
due to the social relationships that

272
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,000
they have with others in the group so

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
one direction to consider is how we can

274
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,779
help users deal with misinformation in

275
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,279
ways that mitigate these social power

276
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,420
dynamics

277
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,000
and this can be in the form of letting

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,519
users anonymously apply a fact checking

279
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,040
icon to certain links or messages that

280
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
they see and offering that fact-checking

281
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
service for everyone else in the group

282
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
to use and interestingly WhatsApp

283
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,560
actually has its own fact checking icon

284
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,720
that they that they piloted a couple of

285
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,880
years ago with a very small limited

286
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,579
number of users and essentially this was

287
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,440
a little magnifying glass that appeared

288
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,740
next to messages and you can tap it and

289
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,360
WhatsApp would perform a web search on

290
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,820
this link and just to clarify because

291
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,279
WhatsApp isn't actually able to inspect

292
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,860
these links to decide where this icon

293
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,560
should be applied to it was applied I

294
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,779
believe across all messages with links

295
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,640
but if we put this ability to

296
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,760
selectively attach these icons to two

297
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,220
links in the hands of users then we can

298
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,260
offer you know relevant fact-checking

299
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,300
services without explicitly accusing

300
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,779
anyone of sending misinformation

301
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,540
and before moving on I'll just note that

302
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,820
that a limitation of this of course is

303
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,620
in very small groups when anonymity

304
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,200
starts breaking down and more user

305
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,120
research would be necessary to look at

306
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,420
how this can actually work in practice

307
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,220
and you may also recall that users are

308
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,140
worried about the platform sacrificing

309
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,480
encryption to correct misinformation so

310
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,160
another direction we can consider here

311
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,920
is how we can empower the user to better

312
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,899
fact check or flag misinformation for

313
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,700
themselves

314
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,560
and this can be in the form of adding

315
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,600
friction when sharing on open links and

316
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
this is actually tested by some

317
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,260
platforms already including this this

318
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,200
mockup you can see from Facebook

319
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
but this has not yet been implemented in

320
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
WhatsApp and we think that implementing

321
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
something like this is especially

322
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
valuable on a platform like WhatsApp

323
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,440
where a lot of information is spread

324
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
through link forwarding

325
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
um and of course there's also the

326
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,980
question of how WhatsApp can reliably

327
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,320
detect whether link has been opened in a

328
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,140
privacy preserving way and beyond that

329
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,420
how to show that to the user without

330
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,880
eroding user trust in the platform's

331
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,459
Privacy so that's a couple things to

332
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,660
carefully consider going forward

333
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,880
okay just to wrap up here I claimed at

334
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
the beginning that misinformation in

335
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,180
WhatsApp is a unique socio-technical

336
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,120
challenge so now let's review why

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
first of all the nature of

338
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,600
misinformation in these private WhatsApp

339
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,279
groups can look quite different than

340
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,500
what we may see in more open social

341
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,180
media platforms such as Facebook and

342
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,339
Twitter for example we did not observe

343
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,800
any instances of this disinformation

344
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,899
where false information was

345
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,899
intentionally spread to cause harm

346
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,639
and you can also see how social

347
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,680
relationships Within These smaller

348
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
private group chats as well as privacy

349
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,980
commitments

350
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,320
um you know made by the broader platform

351
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,300
brings about challenges to

352
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,700
misinformation management

353
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,860
and in the midst of this user

354
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,839
empowerment and mitigating social power

355
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,820
dynamics can be potential ways forward

356
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,399
when designing to combat misinformation

357
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,320
in WhatsApp and end-to-end encrypted

358
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,540
messaging platforms more broadly

359
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,120
and I'll I'll leave you with that and

360
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm happy today questions thank you
