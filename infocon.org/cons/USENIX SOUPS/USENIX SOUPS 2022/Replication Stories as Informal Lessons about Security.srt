1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,099
and I'm very happy to present our work

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,460
which is a replication of stories as

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,920
informal lessons about security

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,160
this is Joint work with Alexander Mai at

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,980
gabapel Emily radar and Katarina

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,439
crumpled

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,699
all right

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,120
and today people without any security

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,640
background are often forced to take

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,219
security critical decisions like for

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,760
instance whether to update a software

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,760
click on a link or which password to

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,559
choose

15
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,079
now usually people do learn from the

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,420
experience how to make good or better

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,539
choices but security threats are often

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,120
subtle and can usually not be noticed

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
easily

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,039
however people can learn from security

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,459
stories so from hearing or reading about

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,979
security threats that happen to somebody

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,860
else like for instance a friend a family

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,659
member or a co-worker

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,420
greater at L were the first that looked

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,159
into security stories in depth in 2012

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,540
where they did a study with

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,479
undergraduate students to check which

29
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,759
characteristics of security stories

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,340
leads to changes in thinking and

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,680
behavior

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,380
and we really love the work and we

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,560
replicated it this time with a more

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,720
diverse sample with participants from

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,579
all age groups and educational

36
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,759
backgrounds and our main aim was to test

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,100
whether the results are still valid

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,439
today and also whether they are valid

39
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,339
for a broader population

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,439
we reused the original questionnaire

41
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,840
with open-ended and close-ended

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,119
questions

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,500
we started with some general questions

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,960
to train the memory of the people and

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,399
make it easier for them to remember

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,258
security stories

47
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,660
and then they had to choose one story

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,520
where you could remember the details

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,220
best and had to answer the rest of the

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,319
questionnaire which were multiple choice

51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,020
and open questions just in relation to

52
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,180
this story

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,280
finally after they finished the whole

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,540
questionnaire and thought and thought

55
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,000
about the story we asked them to tell

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,099
the story as if they would tell it to a

57
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,560
friend in their own words and also with

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,120
as much detail as possible

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,599
for data analysis we used a qualitative

60
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,940
inductive coding for the full stories

61
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,580
and the open questions as well as

62
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,459
regression models to compare our data to

63
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,680
the radar study and also to check for

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,720
differences in the demographics

65
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,400
here you can see the thread categories

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,040
that emerged from our qualitative coding

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,040
which were actually the same as in the

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
radar studies so we could

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,900
find all the categories again

70
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,599
which I think is great and we also found

71
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,760
two new categories which were data

72
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,860
breaches and ransomware which are

73
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,959
threats that mainly emerged in the last

74
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,500
decade

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,540
our participants reported several

76
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,599
Behavior changes which they did after

77
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
hearing the story

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,739
where the most reported was that they

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,080
were more aware and cautious when using

80
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,040
the internet

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,500
followed by changing password security

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,260
practices like for instance using more

83
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,420
secure passwords or changing the

84
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,819
password more often

85
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,700
updating software or using more secure

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,959
software

87
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
monitoring accounts and credit card

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,920
charges

89
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,159
or backing up data which was usually

90
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,260
mentioned after hearing a story about

91
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,000
ransomware

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,879
or even something as Extreme as totally

93
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
quitting Facebook or credit card

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
research

95
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
finally some reported that they stopped

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,599
connecting to insecure Wi-Fi's so we saw

97
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,480
that the stories really let's do

98
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,180
Behavior changes

99
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,820
they also reported that they used

100
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,759
specific tools or Services specifically

101
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,520
after hearing the story where the most

102
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,220
commonly dual was antivirus or secure

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,460
software which again was the same as in

104
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,560
the original study

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
others like second Factor authentication

106
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,380
and vpns were only found in our study

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,139
probably again because they mainly

108
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,820
gained popularity in the last years

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,699
our participants also mentioned that the

110
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,040
Learned distrust from Stars very often

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,759
which unfortunately also frequently led

112
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,979
to helplessness and didn't really have

113
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,479
any positive effect

114
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,540
only if a very concrete action like for

115
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,120
instance monitoring credit card charges

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,880
was presented then the participants

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
actually learned something

118
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,740
and this will explain with related work

119
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,979
on how people learn from Fear which says

120
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,780
that learning from fear is only

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,240
effective if a very concrete action is

122
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,520
presented

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
then finally people also often started

124
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,400
to educate themselves or others after

125
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,060
hearing the story

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,800
for our regression model we first

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,199
replicated the regression models of the

128
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,720
original study where we checked which

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,419
characteristics of the stories change

130
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,080
thinking and behavior and there we think

131
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,759
again that it's a very great outcome

132
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,419
that we found nearly the same results as

133
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,240
in the original study so we can really

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,560
say that that adds some more validity

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,479
we found that stories are generally

136
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,699
likely to change thinking and Behavior

137
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,220
when they contain a lesson like

138
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,979
something you should never always do

139
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,860
when they contain serious threats or

140
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,680
make the participants anxious or angry

141
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,020
which we explained with the negativity

142
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,100
bias that people are usually more aware

143
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,819
of negative events than of positive ones

144
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,120
stories that are autobiographical where

145
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,220
the person that told the story is the

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,680
same one to whom it actually happened

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,139
as well as stores that come from a

148
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,139
knowledgeable Source where we think that

149
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,960
those both characteristics make stories

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,560
more credible

151
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,780
then we also did some additional

152
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,520
regression models to check for

153
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,620
differences in demographics

154
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,840
where the most interesting finding was

155
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,660
that younger people are less likely to

156
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,880
rate the seriousness of threats severe

157
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,180
or to get angry about stories entire

158
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,819
educated people are less likely to

159
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,740
report a change in thinking in general

160
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,680
or be emotionally affected by stories

161
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,080
and here we think that probably younger

162
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,180
people who grew up in the Digital

163
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,400
Society already heard a lot about

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,099
security threats and are fast less

165
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,699
likely surprised by stories however we

166
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,020
still found that they are largely

167
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,860
affected by security stories

168
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,259
so uh summed up we think that our study

169
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,940
adds a lot of validity to the radar

170
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,639
study and shows that the results are

171
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,740
still largely valid today across

172
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,080
different demographics and educational

173
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,699
backgrounds

174
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,660
and we do think that media articles and

175
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,060
security trainings can benefit from our

176
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,720
results by then focusing on stories with

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
concrete actions and serious threats to

178
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
the individual

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
and generally we suggest that it would

180
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
be great to just make people share the

181
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,099
security incidents more like for

182
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,440
instance we had the idea to make an

183
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,599
online platform for people to show to

184
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,360
share stories which could then serve as

185
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
a pool for media articles or security

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
trainings and also in work environments

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
we think it would be very good to make

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
meetings which are just dedicated to

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,340
sharing security stories because we

190
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,860
found that many people reported that

191
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,599
they shared the story because it fitted

192
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,659
the conversation so we think that just

193
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,120
bringing up the topic can already help a

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,299
lot

195
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,760
and finally we think that security

196
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,220
stories should be considered as an

197
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,160
important Source next to for security

198
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,779
advice next to personal experience and

199
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,860
security trainings

200
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,600
all right that brings me to the end of

201
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,820
my presentation and I'm happy to take

202
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,180
questions
