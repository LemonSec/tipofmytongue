1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,580
hi everyone my name is Tanisha uh this

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,759
is my paper Auntie strangers and the FBI

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,740
online privacy concerns and ex

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,500
experiences of books of American women I

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,020
was supported by my co-authors

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,600
um and I'm from the um School of

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,900
information

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,580
so I wanted to jump right into the

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,340
related work historically Muslims in

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,680
America have been othered subjected to

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,559
negative media portrayals and profiled

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,540
by local and federal law enforcement

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,059
there were particular upticks following

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,180
911 as well as the 2016 election that

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,520
gave rise to things that the NYPD Muslim

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,800
surveillance program ultimately all

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,539
these things together made it so that

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,820
this was an identity identity that

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,940
people were very conscious of and feared

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,160
Prejudice for

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,320
so I want to talk also a little bit more

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,780
about gendered islamophobia more

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,159
specifically

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,619
um Muslim women many of whom where the

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,439
hijab are very vulnerable to hate crimes

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,299
due to the hijab being the single most

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,520
visible identifier of Islam

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,140
um and they're also subjected to a

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,939
different form of islamophobia where

31
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,740
they are depicted as oppressed and

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,200
helpless

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
within the culture there are also

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,520
socio-cultural Norms which often impose

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,799
uneven behavioral expectations and

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,080
consequences on women so you can see

37
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,860
this image right here it's from a 2016

38
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,920
paper about privacy in Qatar and you can

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,780
see how privacy in Islam is

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,939
intrinsically tied to ideals of modesty

41
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,340
and family honor and it extends beyond

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,280
the personal self and affects others

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,340
including your family extended family

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,320
and particularly for Muslim women they

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
carry additional responsibilities to

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,520
uphold their family's reputation through

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,200
their own individual actions and

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,619
opinions

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,700
um and the last body of work I was kind

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,799
of looking at had to do with religiosity

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,020
a lot of Prior research shows that

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,758
really high levels of religious

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,520
involvement can both mute some behaviors

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
while encouraging others

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
um in general though uh different

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,120
instruments and surveys that are used to

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
measure levels of religious involvement

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,620
tend to find that people of color and

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,680
women score higher on them than men or

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
people of ethnic majorities which I

61
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,879
found really interesting for the case of

62
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,040
Muslim American women and I was really

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,620
curious about how levels of religiosity

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,720
Might influence privacy behaviors and

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,819
attitudes

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,680
so with all those things in mind I

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,780
decided to lead an interview study uh

68
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,099
using a semi-structured interview

69
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,260
protocol this is a relatively

70
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,300
understudied population

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,459
um most previous studies exploring the

72
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,319
Privacy needs of Muslim women have been

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,840
in Muslim majority countries I mean I

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,879
was really curious about if there were

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,040
any additional privacy concerns most of

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,599
American women had because of this

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,819
environmental shift I was really

78
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,560
interested in understanding privacy

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,319
attitudes behaviors and preferences So

80
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,599
based on the related work I chose to

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,060
focus on three kinds of risk scenarios

82
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,580
first being government surveillance then

83
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,080
social surveillance within their

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,580
communities and lastly online

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,340
islamophobia

86
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,800
so this is the average of our

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,900
participants or an overview of our

88
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,819
participants the average age was about

89
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,000
28 and we mostly had young professional

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,819
women in our sample we had some ethnic

91
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,819
diversity and you'll also see the CRS

92
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,060
scale uh I mean the CRS score which

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,340
stands for the centrality of religiosity

94
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,599
scale

95
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,000
um this I will talk about later I was

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,620
using this as a measure to capture

97
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,500
levels of individual religiosity but it

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,780
wasn't necessarily as effective as I

99
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,060
thought it would be

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,980
so I talked a little bit about the

101
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,959
process and I'd also like to now get

102
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,879
into the findings so I would categorize

103
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,099
my findings into three kinds of layers

104
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,680
the first being privacy concerns are

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,959
participants identified as related to

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,940
their identity as broadly Muslim

107
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,159
American then there were some specific

108
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,379
concerns they held as being more

109
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,440
granularly Muslim American women finally

110
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,199
I also identified some privacy concerns

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
our participants shared that they

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,320
believed were results of their

113
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,419
individual practices of Islam

114
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,940
so for the first uh privacy concern or

115
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,160
body of concerns talking about things

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,139
that they felt were tied to their

117
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,360
identities as Muslims broadly in America

118
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,060
we had two sides of this first being

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,160
government surveillance and second being

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,560
online islamophobia

121
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
almost all of our participants felt that

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,759
the Muslim Community was subjected to

123
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,800
targeted government surveillance either

124
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,139
by the US military or some other

125
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,180
government entity

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,820
um and so this was one of the scenarios

127
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,680
that our participants felt they had at

128
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,259
the least level of control in in fact

129
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,540
most of them felt safest on operating

130
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,580
under the assumption that the government

131
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,620
had access to everything they did or

132
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,660
said including in private text messages

133
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,060
or face-to-face conversation and this

134
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,100
created kind of a chilling effect in our

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,500
participants who didn't really have any

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,180
other strategies Beyond self-censorship

137
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,440
the second Risk online islamophobia was

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,539
less of a concern for our participants

139
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,280
in the sense that they adopted

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,139
strategies that were successful for them

141
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,360
that successfully kept them from being

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
targets of online islamophobia so these

143
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,280
strategies included things like changing

144
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,199
audience settings or making their

145
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,139
accounts private and they thought that

146
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,820
they were pretty much working for the

147
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,320
most part and keeping them from being

148
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,259
targets however this did not stop them

149
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,600
from regularly witnessing other

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
instances of islamophobic sentiments

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
shared online

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,680
so now getting more into the social

153
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
surveillance aspect and concerns that

154
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,000
our participants shared as a part of

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,039
their ident as related to their identity

156
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,800
as Muslim American women so a hundred

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,539
percent of our participants felt that

158
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,280
men and women within their cultural

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,800
communities were treated differently and

160
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,539
were subjected to different expectations

161
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,000
and consequences when we're talking

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,039
about the online world what we really

163
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,340
saw was a very heightened scenario of

164
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,460
context collapse in which the spaces

165
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,680
like social media flattened their Social

166
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Circles and very different relationships

167
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,300
were kind of brought into the same

168
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,940
spheres this made it so that many of our

169
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,860
participants felt they couldn't be their

170
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,440
authentic selves online and share these

171
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,120
types of content so you'll see the

172
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,340
different kinds of bubbles these are

173
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,080
particular types of content that our

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,479
participants felt if they shared and

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
were shared to the wrong people within

176
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,639
their Community could have very bad

177
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,979
consequences especially of reputational

178
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:56,940
harm

179
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,340
um and the main threats in this

180
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,500
situation or in this scenario involve

181
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,080
religious Elders Community elders and

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,800
extended family

183
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,440
okay and finally I'll talk more about

184
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,300
concerns our participants share that

185
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,979
we're tied to their individual beliefs

186
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,620
and practices of Islam so as I mentioned

187
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,979
earlier the CRS scale I was using it to

188
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,740
get better a better read about our

189
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,539
participants individual levels of

190
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,539
religiosity however I found that it was

191
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,940
actually pretty uh inconsistent and not

192
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,220
actually an accurate portrayal of the

193
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,259
very diverse set of belief practice

194
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,120
beliefs and practices I saw in my

195
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,400
participants instead I decided to rely

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,160
more on the interview data and decided

197
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
to think about religiosity in three

198
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,000
different ways instead so I thought

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,680
about it in terms of frequency of

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,840
intentional religious practices failing

201
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,780
practices and public Muslim activism or

202
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,300
public Muslim leadership such as within

203
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,979
an organization like the Muslim student

204
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,599
organization

205
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,000
foreign

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,680
so the harms that our participants

207
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
experience as a result of these kind of

208
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,880
Faith practices depending on the type of

209
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,919
Faith categorization so as far as

210
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,199
failing practices go we had women who

211
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,759
were the hijab and women who didn't wear

212
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,740
the hijab and the women who did wear the

213
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,020
hijab had very specific privacy concerns

214
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,560
that were a product of them choosing to

215
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,300
entertain that practice or engage in

216
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,919
that practice

217
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,259
um for example women who wore the hijab

218
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,360
still wanted to share and self-self

219
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,039
selfies in themselves with their hair

220
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,279
out to other women but they had a lot of

221
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,740
concerns about how secure photo sharing

222
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,559
Services were actually

223
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,360
additionally for things like public

224
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,520
Muslim activism there were a lot of

225
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,480
consequences involved included fear of

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,920
negative effect on job and hiring

227
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,500
outcomes Financial consequences and

228
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,560
things like Canary mission where people

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,839
are being doxed for being pro-palestine

230
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,000
activists that expose their personal

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,220
information and obviously bring on

232
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,959
threats to their physical safety and

233
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,800
online harassment

234
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,480
so ultimately based on all these

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,860
different concerns our participants

236
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,839
shared we came up with a couple of

237
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,580
different design implications and I

238
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,959
would really recommend reading the paper

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,180
to see more about that the first being

240
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,459
maintaining boundaries on social media

241
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,459
our participants felt safest when they

242
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,380
felt they were very clear and distinct

243
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,240
boundaries made between apps and

244
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
platforms and different social media so

245
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,500
that they could reserve some accounts

246
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,920
for some purposes and others for others

247
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,800
as different companies like meta tried

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
to merge and create integrated

249
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,940
ecosystems between their products like

250
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,740
Instagram and Facebook it's really

251
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,560
important that we give users more

252
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,420
granular options for audience control

253
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,459
and visibility and discoverability

254
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,279
settings

255
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,200
we also saw participants struggle a lot

256
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,180
with getting their privacy settings to

257
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,880
reflect their preferences one thing that

258
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,980
we heard voiced a lot was just a

259
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,260
question about why privacy defaults are

260
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,080
designed the way they are when for our

261
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,240
participants they don't even care about

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,540
having specific customized settings they

263
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,339
actually just wanted everything set to

264
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,620
the restrictive most restrictive option

265
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,320
on the get-go and why not have privacy

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,880
default set that way from the first

267
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,120
place

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,860
um and finally I think the third most

269
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,080
important implication is that we need to

270
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,300
realize how important it is to partner

271
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,000
with local and internal Community

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,580
organizations so another important

273
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,040
finding is when I asked our participants

274
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
you know who is it that you go to for

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
privacy advice who is your most trusted

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,940
source of privacy advice they all named

277
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,980
either a family member or a close friend

278
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,500
who was Muslim as well so we really need

279
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,839
to leverage the trust that exists

280
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,700
internally within this community by

281
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,560
partnering with them to more effectively

282
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,160
Reach This population and educate in

283
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,440
instances of security workshops or

284
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,760
digital hygiene training

285
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,399
so in summary uh this study helped us

286
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,920
find that muscle Muslim American women

287
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
do indeed have identity specific

288
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,660
concerns a lot of these concerns

289
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,540
manifest on different layers based on

290
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,399
the different intersectional pieces of

291
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,160
their identity they've adopted a lot of

292
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,019
workaround strategies

293
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,519
um some which are successful others

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,000
which maybe not so much but ultimately

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,740
regardless of these strategies they

296
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,100
still are left with many unmet needs

297
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,560
that concludes my presentation I will

298
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,079
let my co-author yishun take over the Q

299
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,819
a and thank you so much
