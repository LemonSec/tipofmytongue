1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,800
I will be talking about the potential of

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,260
security and privacy adapts to serve at

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,180
the social resource in the user's quest

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,340
for more secure and privacy preserving

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,220
Behavior we know that help from multiple

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,900
peers can impact the behavior of their

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,899
users positively and based on that it

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,579
has been suggested for example to build

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,320
a security neighborhood departure to

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,760
support tech savvy people and giving

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,960
peer advice

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,239
however we know from prior work that

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,680
text that we people have little interest

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,719
in it and meaning in the s p behavior of

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,180
the social environment and we want to

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,340
know why that's so and how can we change

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,379
it so our research about the twofold

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,539
first we want to investigate the status

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,760
quo of s p support giving in the private

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,860
context and second we want to explore

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,800
options to overcome existing barriers to

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,059
do this we first connected

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,459
semi-structured interviews with 13 SMP

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,280
adapts received a 20 Euro gift card for

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,920
their participation and we conducted the

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,400
Thematic analysis on the data we found

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,860
that almost all of our participants had

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,619
tried to raise the s p awareness of

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,240
their family and friends at some point

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
and almost all were regularly asked for

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,220
advice and enjoyed it or for some also

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,080
reported negative aspect on being asked

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,060
for advice for example being asked to

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,759
open them up the same topics half of our

36
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,259
participants said that they had

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,360
experienced social conflicts due to

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,759
their s p behavior for example with

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,979
family members about using iot devices

40
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,380
in their homes also half of our

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,540
participants had tried to motivate

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,400
others but mainly to use secure

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,340
authentication also have a rep of our

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,380
participants that they feel responsible

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,500
for their parents at NP but not for the

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,180
SMP of others in their social

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,460
environment because they thought the

48
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,680
position to behave securely in privacy

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,960
preservingly was a personal one that

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,140
they had no right to interfere with

51
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,098
accordingly less than half of our

52
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,660
participants said that they had ever

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,640
actively interfered in someone else's

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,340
security and privacy Behavior

55
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,920
we also found that conversations about s

56
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,840
p were mainly sparked by putting

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520
together with others in front of the

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,739
computer or by using someone else's

59
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,319
computer or giving General tech support

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,080
most participants said that they would

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,540
talk with others about using protection

62
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,940
measures and data breaches or security

63
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,599
incidents but only to other SMP adapts

64
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,940
because they thought that non-tech heavy

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,440
people were not interested in those

66
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,420
topics

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,640
not surprisingly one of the main

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,220
obstacles of giving SMP support was the

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,980
lack of interest for example one of our

70
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,260
participants said that it's like when

71
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,000
someone tells me something about breath

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
and music I would nod my head and say

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,660
that's interesting but that wouldn't

74
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,459
really interest me and that's exactly

75
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,379
how I feel the other way around

76
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,300
other half circles included social

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,220
aspects such as not wanting to bother

78
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,620
others or being inclusive or support

79
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,599
giving mean to time consuming or too

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,060
much effort

81
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,519
participants get gave solicited or

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,860
unsolicited advice they received more

83
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,720
positive than negative reactions for

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,239
example interest gratitude sympathy and

85
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,700
acceptance while negative reactions were

86
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,760
mainly disinterest

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,800
um our participants also receive mainly

88
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,680
neutral reactions to their own s p

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,780
behavior that is others were mostly

90
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
mutually surprised

91
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,580
however some participants also reported

92
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,159
being smiled upon for example I think if

93
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,019
you're interested in data security you

94
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,580
always get these jogging things that

95
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,019
you're one of the team's Point had just

96
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,760
a paranoid people

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,099
almost all of our participants said that

98
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,900
they had brought about no long-term

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,440
change in other s p Behavior but that

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,959
they would understand this ignorance of

101
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,400
their advisor would not take it

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,440
personally

103
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,440
based on these findings we conducted a

104
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,780
second study free co-creation workshops

105
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,480
with 11 additional s p adapts received

106
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,239
25 Euros or 20 pounds for their

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
participation again we conducted the

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,978
Thematic analysis on the data our goal

109
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,798
was to explore solutions to support SMP

110
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,320
adapts in their support and regrouped

111
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,940
the solutions that came up during the

112
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,180
workshops into four themes the first is

113
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,100
to set a constructive dialogue space

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,500
because it is complicated to address FMP

115
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,080
Topics in normal conversations for

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,300
example one of our participants said I

117
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,040
don't usually come into situations where

118
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
my family or friends asked me about

119
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,940
Black security and privacy behavior and

120
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,620
when I speak to those people I usually

121
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,240
have other topics in mind that just

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
randomly start in giving advice on

123
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
Internet Security

124
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,300
so to attract this it is first important

125
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,639
to create a constructive atmosphere for

126
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,800
example by establishing social norms for

127
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,259
such connotations but also by finding a

128
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,240
balance between creating awareness and

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
accepting the user's FMP attitude which

130
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,940
might differ from that of the s p adapt

131
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,280
to establish contact without violating

132
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,340
social norms a possible solution might

133
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,759
be drifically delegate one's own s p in

134
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,560
the private context following the lines

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
of for example data protection offices

136
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,840
in the professional context s p adapts

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,419
can use ice breakers such as referring

138
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,220
to movies or the introduction of new

139
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,759
technologies like contact tracing apps

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,460
it is also important to build trust for

141
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,860
example by using startup certification

142
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,900
or score that keeps changing based on

143
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,240
the advice given however some

144
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,520
participants also said that it would be

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,620
necessarily to have trustworthy

146
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,479
institutions back up their statements

147
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,880
for example these institutions need to

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
say that's how taking works on the

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,539
internet yeah that's super creepy I'm

150
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,520
sure you guys don't want that if you do

151
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,320
it at individual doesn't matter how

152
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,060
great people think you are then you

153
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,000
sound like a conspiracy theorist

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
the second set of solutions grouped

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,440
around the harness harnessing the

156
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,840
potential of exchange because some

157
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,699
participants complain about being asked

158
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,160
too often about the fame or about topics

159
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,940
that they found hard to earn surgery

160
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,940
um to attract this we could promote the

161
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,039
exchange between s p adults for example

162
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,960
by sharing successful tactics and

163
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,300
strategies for support but also by

164
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,220
referring people thinking help to others

165
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,419
that they lists who are more

166
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,759
knowledgeable in this area

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,740
we could also promote the exchange

168
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,720
between users for example by using a

169
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,419
snowball system and you say hey I've

170
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,979
already explained something similar to

171
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,680
this guy goes to him or by creating a

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,720
peer system for example in a skill

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
context

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,380
the third set of solutions grouped

175
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
around debilitating knowledge transfer

176
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,400
because the part is sometimes hard to

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,139
give due to the lack of understanding

178
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,780
and interest of the Safari

179
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,180
and to attract this view first have to

180
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,100
find a common ground for example by

181
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,259
using dictionaries that translate terms

182
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,660
between adapts and lay users by using

183
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,340
consistent terms that do not keep

184
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,340
changing over the years like virus

185
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,380
um but we could also use metaphors to

186
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,240
explain complicated technical issues

187
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,960
such as end-to-end encryption or we

188
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,720
could give SMP adapt some kind of

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,960
communication training

190
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,240
it is also important to highlight the

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,699
relevance of security and privacy

192
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,860
protection for example by illustrating

193
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,680
the consequences of s p violations by

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,860
using realized choice for example

195
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,979
and the final set of solutions focused

196
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,139
around strengthening the capabilities

197
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,139
and opportunities of s p adapts because

198
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,120
sometimes it is difficult to keep up to

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,680
date especially if the part is not

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,039
rewarded and to do this we first have to

201
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,740
improve expert knowledge for example by

202
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,560
providing a new sticker that summarizes

203
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,440
new research findings for practitioners

204
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
by publishing Open Access or by creating

205
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,020
testing knowledge quizzes

206
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,479
we should also reward the part giving

207
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,340
for example by making working time

208
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,039
available for support by recognizing

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,539
support giving as a professional

210
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,960
achievement or by emphasizing the social

211
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,139
aspects of the process

212
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,080
still to sum up our recommendations

213
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
based on our findings would be for s p

214
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,940
adapts to signal that they are available

215
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,120
as experts to use conversation Stars

216
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
such as movies to talk about security

217
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,159
and privacy topics to stay positive and

218
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,440
to establish a common ground and find a

219
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,779
shared language and conversations

220
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,940
our recommendations for the whole

221
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,760
research Community would be to reward

222
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,399
support giving to facilitate access to

223
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,440
information for example by publishing

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,019
open access to establish a peer system

225
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,120
and to create a platform for

226
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,060
professional Exchange

227
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,760
challenges in doing this might be that s

228
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,040
p adapts might not recognize their own

229
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,380
knowledge gaps or need for action

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,040
if they do SMP adapts must ensure not to

231
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,160
reference equals to malicious actors and

232
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,560
finally SMP adapts might lack the time

233
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,440
and motivation for support

234
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,279
so to conclude our results indicate that

235
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,440
there indeed is a great potential to use

236
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,839
SMP adapts as the social resource to

237
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,240
improve lay users FMP Behavior

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,380
but we must must support these SMP

239
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,540
adapts and their support

240
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,000
thank you for your attention I'm now

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,899
happy to take questions
