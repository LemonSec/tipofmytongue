00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,160
hi everyone I'm Miranda and today I'm

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,840
presenting work done with my co-authors

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,179
Eric Yoshi and frenzy at the University

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,580
of Washington Lori thank you for reading

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,920
the title and a Content warning before

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,500
we begin this talk will discuss uses of

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,480
technology for abuse and interpersonal

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,519
relationships so please don't hesitate

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,900
to step out of the room or do whatever

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,880
is best for you

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,740
so maybe some of you have heard of this

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,360
app called tick tock

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,820
Tick Tock is a social media platform on

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,219
which users post short videos including

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,020
trending dance challenges but also many

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,579
other types of content

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,860
the app reached 1 billion monthly users

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,200
in 2021 just four years after it

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,239
launched and Tick Tock users are very

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,980
young compared to other social media

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,739
apps with over 50 percent being 29 or

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,180
younger

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,280
there are many Loosely Affiliated

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,440
sub-communities which can be very Niche

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,379
but also exceptionally honest and open

27
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,180
and some of the things that the users

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
honestly and openly discuss on Tick Tock

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,020
have serious privacy and security

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,299
implications so let's just Dive Right

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,680
into an example I know we all want to

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,380
see the tick tocks

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,140
and there's no sound but I guess you can

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,860
hear or you can see the caption on the

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,900
slide which says welcome to toxic Tick

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
Tock this doesn't happen anymore but I

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,979
got you if he's being sketchy this will

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,619
pick up all his calls and if you hear

39
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,720
that you don't want to hear I'm so sorry

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,520
BB

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,200
so in this Tick Tock the Creator

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,240
describes how to secretly listen in on

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,640
what someone else is doing or saying

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
step one is to get access to the

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,659
Target's phone and turn on a feature

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,939
that was originally described that

47
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,860
automatically picks up incoming calls

48
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,479
which is originally intended as an

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,119
accessibility feature step two when the

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
attacker wants to listen in the attacker

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,899
calls the Target's phone which will

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,640
automatically pick up allowing the

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,860
target the attacker to eavesdrop without

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,960
the target taking any action

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,700
and this is an example of what we

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,219
studied which we call anti-privacy and

57
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,160
anti-security advice

58
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,419
anti-privacy and anti-security because

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,580
the techniques often involve violating

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,500
privacy or breaking device and account

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,580
security

62
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,379
and advice because the videos are

63
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,060
intended as guidance intended to be

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,040
widely seen

65
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,920
in this research we first ask what

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,239
information or systems are being

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,280
targeted in anti-privacy or

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,440
anti-security advice on Tick Tock and by

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,540
whom how are these attacks being carried

70
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
out and for what reasons

71
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,980
and second how do anti-privacy and

72
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,020
anti-security advice relate to a broader

73
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,239
societal context

74
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,560
so now I'd like to talk about our

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,319
methods we used a case study methodology

76
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,300
and we selected our research questions

77
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,519
and case studies at the same time using

78
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,140
an approach called Progressive focusing

79
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,780
the aim of progressive focusing is to

80
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,940
thoroughly understand the case if early

81
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,920
research questions are not working or if

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,019
new issues become apparent the design is

83
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,420
changed so in this way we considered

84
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,099
other contacts like Proctor wear and

85
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,019
Smart Homes but ultimately focused on

86
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,459
intimate partners and parent-child

87
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,140
relationships

88
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,540
and to collect data we continually add a

89
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,519
new Search terms as we explored relevant

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,620
topics and creators and some example

91
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,720
keywords were toxic relationships

92
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,860
parental controls and kid tracking

93
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,099
our final data set had 98 tick tocks 66

94
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,840
were from the intimate partner context

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,300
27 were from the parent child context

96
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,940
and five were related to both

97
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,159
in some these videos accounted for 60

98
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,680
minutes and 14 seconds of content and

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,940
though we don't have access to view

100
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,220
counts we do know that these videos were

101
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,840
very popular because they got more than

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
16 million likes in total

103
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
across all of our data we apply two

104
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,760
flavors of thematic analysis to answer

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,500
our two research questions

106
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,780
first we use deductive thematic analysis

107
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,519
which is Theory driven and specifically

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,959
our theory was a security threat

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,819
modeling framework to understand the

110
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,099
attacker the assets the techniques and

111
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,780
the rationales

112
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,760
second we applied inductive thematic

113
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,920
analysis which is data driven to

114
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,200
generate themes from what we observed

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
and specifically what was the social

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,640
context of the videos we collected

117
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,379
and I also want to recognize that our

118
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,360
analyzes and our interpretations are a

119
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,858
result of our particular social and

120
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,199
ideological positionings so other teams

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,260
would have generated other themes

122
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,120
also very important for this work are

123
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,460
the ethical considerations that we made

124
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,560
first we study data that is publicly

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,419
available which meant that our study was

126
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,240
deemed exempt by our institution's IRB

127
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,940
but does this mean that the public that

128
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,520
but does the public nature of this data

129
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,440
mean that creators would allow or expect

130
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,199
their data to be used for research so to

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,240
protect creators privacy we recreated

132
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,100
all content and paraphrased all quotes

133
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,660
for this talk as well as in the paper

134
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,820
our goal is to study the techniques and

135
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,740
the motivations but not identify the

136
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,720
specific creators

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
we also acknowledge that we surface

138
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,979
complicated social ethics questions for

139
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,840
example should these techniques that we

140
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,880
study be used in consensual or trusting

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,400
relationships so while we don't resolve

142
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,199
that question here we hope our research

143
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,479
can inform the answer

144
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,460
all right so what do we find

145
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,500
here is an overview of the actors

146
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,479
motivations and techniques in our two

147
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,180
cases in the intimate partner context we

148
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,280
have the instigator and the target the

149
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,380
instigator's motivations broadly were to

150
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,000
detect cheating do arbitrary

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,039
surveillance or exert control on the

152
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,020
Target and we found a total of 24

153
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,539
techniques including abusing data

154
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,940
downloads checking recently used emojis

155
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
and more

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,780
in the parent-child context we have the

157
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,520
parent and the child with the child

158
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
ranging from early school age to

159
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,600
teenagers and the parents motivations

160
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,000
were broadly to ensure child safety or

161
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
exert control

162
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
in the paper we also discussed the child

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,800
perspective but I'll skip that for this

164
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,120
talk

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,919
we found seven techniques including

166
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,900
hiding air tags in their children's bags

167
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,320
installing tracking apps and more

168
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
so the inishment partner context for

169
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
instigators who wanted to surveil

170
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,199
digital Communications one Technique we

171
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,080
observed was exploiting Data downloads

172
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,139
data downloads are a feature a privacy

173
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,300
feature in fact made common by gdpr's

174
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,400
right of access so for example you can

175
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,900
download a copy of the information you

176
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,580
shared with Instagram including all of

177
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,740
the sent messages in the screenshot

178
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,720
showed here the video suggests entering

179
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,580
the instigator's email address in the

180
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,500
data download request form so that the

181
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,180
instigator is sent a copy of the

182
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,580
Target's Instagram Direct messages

183
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,860
and in this scenario physical access to

184
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,020
the target's device is assumed the

185
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,180
video's first instruction is just go on

186
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,740
his Instagram because in close

187
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,780
relationships the common Assumption of

188
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,880
one person's perfectly secure device

189
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,520
does not hold up

190
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,259
another technique for surveilling

191
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,819
digital Communications in the intimate

192
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,979
partner context is to use emojis as a

193
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,080
side Channel as one Tick Tock Creator

194
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,180
said I have personally used this before

195
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
to confirm or deny my suspicions just

196
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,199
casually ask for his phone and find a

197
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,419
way to type something on the keyboard so

198
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,220
how does this work well it's often

199
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
possible to view a keyboard on a

200
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,060
smartphone without unlocking it

201
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,800
so The Tick Tock suggests looking for

202
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,419
sexually suggestive emojis like

203
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,580
eggplants or peaches to infer whether

204
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,060
the target is sexting other people if

205
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,500
the target doesn't usually send those

206
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,880
emojis to the instigator

207
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,199
to show an example from the parent-child

208
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,419
context many parents were interested in

209
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,520
surveilling their children's location

210
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,259
one popular technique for younger

211
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,180
children was to use air tags despite

212
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,039
Apple condemning the use of air tires

213
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,139
for tracking people by putting air tags

214
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,060
like on a bracelet and shown shown in

215
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,160
this screenshot or hiding air tags in

216
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,380
the soles of their children's shoes

217
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,660
for older children some parents required

218
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,639
their their children to download Family

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,979
surveillance apps like Life 360 or bark

220
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,080
and these apps can track location but

221
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
also things like how fast they're

222
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,139
driving what they're texting on their

223
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,000
phone and their social media usage

224
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,380
thinking about the social context of the

225
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,240
advice we observed we saw that social

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,039
acceptability norms informed the

227
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,020
language that creators used to frame

228
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,120
their advice so in the intimate partner

229
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,979
context the videos had a covert framing

230
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,900
they put fake disclaimers at the

231
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,280
beginning to say that these videos are

232
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,259
only for informational purposes but then

233
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,000
going into precise detail about how

234
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,099
exactly to use this technique

235
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,319
the videos use hashtags like toxic

236
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,360
stalker or crazy girlfriend and that's

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
because surveillance and control against

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,780
another adult is typically seen as

239
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,759
socially unacceptable so creators were

240
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,440
self-aware that the techniques could be

241
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,300
seen as transgressing social and legal

242
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,440
norms

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
in the parent-child context however the

244
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,299
videos had an overt framing the videos

245
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,219
were directly giving advice saying I

246
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,599
highly recommend this if you have a

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,399
child going to school and were tagged

248
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,500
with Mom hacks or parenting because in

249
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
the parent-child context parents were

250
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,980
open about these techniques being used

251
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,899
for child safety which does align with

252
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,660
social and legal norms

253
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,519
gender was also a notable part of the

254
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,560
social context of our data set

255
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,120
videos in the independent partner

256
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,459
context assumed a female audience with a

257
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,660
male partner

258
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,820
for example ladies the goal is to

259
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,500
manipulate the algorithm basically how

260
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,839
men manipulate us which could speak to

261
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,940
the expectation that women do emotional

262
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,060
labor in heterosexual relationships

263
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,700
in the parent-child context video spoke

264
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,040
to moms with children and use hashtags

265
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,560
like save our children mom hack and moms

266
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
of tick tock which could speak to the

267
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,100
expectation that women do most of the

268
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,040
domestic labor and parenting of children

269
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,360
all right so coming now to the

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,580
conclusion of this talk our work shows

271
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,899
that information on how to do

272
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,459
surveillance and control is becoming

273
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,839
more accessible

274
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,940
Tick Tock sub communities are publicly

275
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,760
producing advice on privacy and security

276
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,560
violating techniques that anyone can

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,399
find

278
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,140
these techniques are accessible to

279
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,640
people with little to no technical

280
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,100
expertise and the content is packaged in

281
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,800
bite-sized viral video clips

282
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,380
our work joins a growing community of

283
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,700
security and privacy researchers

284
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,560
critiquing classic security and privacy

285
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,760
assumptions

286
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,680
first this work calls attention to

287
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,420
interpersonal adversaries who might have

288
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,040
physical access to their Target's

289
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,839
devices and this is a very realistic

290
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,180
threat for many people meaning research

291
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,800
and design must think Beyond one person

292
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,360
one device

293
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,459
and further the creators we observed had

294
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,140
deeply personal motivations for their

295
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,700
actions which means that simple

296
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,260
Technical Solutions won't be enough

297
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,300
these creators were very creative in

298
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,220
achieving their goals so Solutions will

299
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,920
have to be designed with realistic user

300
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,360
behavior in mind

301
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,100
and Tick Tock is a great place to

302
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,080
understand users more deeply so here are

303
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,580
some pros and cons for security and

304
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,800
privacy researchers who might consider

305
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,740
using tiktok as a data source one pro is

306
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,000
that Tick Tock users tend to be

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,980
remarkably open which leads to more

308
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,140
insightful data security and privacy

309
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,880
research studies often have to contend

310
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,100
with social desirability bias for

311
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,660
example if we try to interview people

312
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,100
about surveilling controlling their

313
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,019
Partners or children our data would not

314
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,240
have been as rich as it was and further

315
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,339
tick-tocks users are younger than other

316
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,620
social media platforms

317
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,000
on the other hand there are also

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,160
challenges to using Tick-Tock data and

319
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,420
first and foremost is that there are

320
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,860
many ethical considerations with

321
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,140
Gathering public data for example

322
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,000
research must think carefully about how

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,459
to fairly treat content when creators

324
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,019
might not expect that it be used for

325
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,100
research

326
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,899
and it is still difficult to collect

327
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,760
Tick-Tock data at scale because the

328
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,160
research API has not been released yet

329
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,200
finally understanding Tick Tock videos

330
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,060
requires understanding the community

331
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,920
come from including their language and

332
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,140
style in summary we hope future work

333
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,019
considers using Tick Tock data carefully

334
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,459
thanks so much for listening and I'm

335
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,479
happy to take questions now
