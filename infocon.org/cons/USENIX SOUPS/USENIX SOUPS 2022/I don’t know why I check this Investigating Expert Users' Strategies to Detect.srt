1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,440
I'm Peter and together with my colleague

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,619
Constantine we will be

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,600
presenting the work of our colleagues

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,720
and ourselves on Expert users strategies

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
to detect email signature spoofing

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
attacks

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,060
it is well known from the related work

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,300
that signatures spoofing in opengpg and

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,980
S mime

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,260
sorry it's possible

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,500
for example these two emails

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,540
look very similar but the one on the

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,120
right actually has a spoofed signature

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
and it is commonly believed that expert

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,660
users can detect such manipulations

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,180
we wanted to investigate this closely

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,579
and um

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,620
for this formulated five research

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,539
questions

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,059
but first we wanted to see which checks

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,420
do expert users actually apply when

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,700
checking the legitimacy of email

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,900
signatures

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,180
and how do these form overarching

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,680
strategies

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,060
secondly

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,220
we wanted to see how useful are these

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,860
checks that expert users perform

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,159
and connected to this how successful are

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,140
experts in detecting these attacks

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,820
and fourthly we want us to see whether

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,740
the success actually correlates with

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,080
other self-reported measures and last

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,240
but not least we also looked at how

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,979
users perceive this whole checking

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,259
process

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,759
now unfortunately I don't have time for

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,020
all of these questions

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,180
but you can find all the details in the

41
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,680
paper

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,140
for our investigation we use the

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,520
multi-step approach

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,240
the first step was a pre-study to find

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
the most commonly used email client and

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,659
email enter and security technology

47
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,420
of our Target participant group that is

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,880
expert users

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,959
to that we surveyed 23 participants at

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,020
the chaos communication camp in 2019 and

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,840
found that Thunderbird and Enigma were

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,020
the most popular combination

53
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,660
we then created four emails

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,120
um with spoofed signatures based on the

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,420
scenario and these are based on the weak

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,800
forgeries

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,560
um described in the work of Miller and

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
colleagues

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,379
we will come back to these in more

60
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,700
detail later in the talk

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,099
we then created our study design

62
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,440
that would allow us to capture the

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
participants strategies and the

64
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,160
reasoning behind applying these

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,599
strategies

66
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,840
first participants gave consent and then

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,879
received explanations

68
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,900
and Then followed the first

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,400
questionnaire where we investigated the

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,080
participants expertise and the frequency

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,280
of use of the of Thunderbird and enigma

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,019
and then came the main part of the study

73
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,360
where the participants had to assess

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,659
eight emails that is the four with

75
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,700
spoofed signatures and four with

76
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,340
legitimate signatures regarding their

77
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,120
legitimacy in a think aloud setting

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,340
we created specifically an environment

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,959
for the participants where they could

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,300
use a real Thunderbird instance

81
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,700
um to do these checks so that would have

82
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,920
available all the features that they

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,720
would have when they would do these

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,220
checks in real life

85
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,780
to progress from one email to another

86
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,700
they actually had to close the

87
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,840
Thunderbird

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
um then a questionnaire regarding the

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,519
legitimacy would be shown and when they

90
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,680
closed this window a new thunderbird

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
instance with the next email would be

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
shown

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,739
in the last part we collected the rcbus

94
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,420
and sa6 scales

95
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,760
and after all that and there was a

96
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
debriefing for the participants and they

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,459
had the opportunity to ask any questions

98
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,620
we piloted this design at the cares

99
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,500
communication Congress 2019 with nine

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,840
participants that were recruited using

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,299
flyers and approaching them directly

102
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,879
and this test run actually allowed us to

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,940
remedy a few

104
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,199
issues with our emails for example

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
specific headers that participants were

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
looking for and also allowed us to

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,580
improve the think aloud setup

108
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,919
the main study was then conducted at

109
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,080
fostem a European conference for open

110
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,840
source developers that was in February

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,840
2020 so that was pre-pandemic and in

112
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,919
person

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,960
participants were again recruited using

114
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,419
flyers and approaching them directly

115
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,180
and overall we could collect 25 valid

116
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,860
sets of think aloud recordings and

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,780
questionnaire responses

118
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,520
so what did we find from this data

119
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,040
we first looked at the checks and the

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,699
strategies that expert uses all right

121
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,259
performed

122
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,840
and we found that over all 23 different

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,300
checks

124
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,740
were performed by the participants with

125
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,680
an average of 9.8 checks by each

126
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,199
participant in their strategies

127
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,080
we then looked at the

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,360
strategies how they were formed from

129
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,979
these checks

130
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,759
and on the right side here you see the

131
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,100
transitions that the participants made

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,960
from one check to another

133
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,240
and I don't expect you to get a full

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
grasp of this the important message here

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
is we had a high diversity in these

136
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,139
strategies and actually we observed

137
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,960
participants wandering around the UI

138
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,300
building their strategy only during our

139
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,160
study

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
all right and that's it for my site and

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,080
I will hand off to Consulting cool

142
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,940
uh thank you Peter

143
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,580
all right the next question was how

144
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,680
useful were these 23 different checks

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,300
that we saw participants apply actually

146
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,780
how useful were they to spot the attacks

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,300
we threw with them right so um the first

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,240
attack well attack was just an invalid

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
signature right we switched some bits in

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
the signature value and this is what

151
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,880
happens in thunderbridge if you use the

152
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,940
enikmail add-on you get this enigmail

153
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,660
um

154
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,000
bar at the top which is yellow and it

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
says this is an unverified signature

156
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
attached to this email right so

157
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,300
regarding the checks one very simple

158
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,120
check would be to just look for this any

159
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
mail Banner that should pop up there and

160
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
if it's yellow or if it says something

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,180
about an unverified signature I could

162
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,160
come to the conclusion that this email

163
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,960
is actually not trustworthy because it

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
has an invalid signature of some kind

165
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
this would be one example check so if

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,780
you look at all of the checks that our

167
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,940
participants did we figured out that

168
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,620
four out of those 23 checks were

169
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,660
actually useful and could help our

170
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,020
participants identify males of this kind

171
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,300
as an attack right the next attack was

172
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,160
your eye spoofing right so this message

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,860
has actually no pgp signature attached

174
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,259
to it at all and we just put some HTML

175
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,660
elements into the message body right and

176
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,060
it gets rendered like this to mimic the

177
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,680
actual bar that would show up on top of

178
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,060
it

179
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,139
um right so um one example check to

180
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,940
actually that's actually useful to

181
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,560
identify this kind of attack would be to

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,300
look for the letter icon status right

183
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,759
and it may not only puts a bar on top

184
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,520
but they also put a icon next to the

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,020
date there it's missing there if I go

186
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,580
back to the last attack you'll see

187
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,340
there's a small letter icon at the top

188
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,039
right and if there's no signature

189
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,419
attached to the mail at all there's no

190
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,759
icon at all right so this would be one

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,940
way to spot this attack

192
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,560
um overall there are five out of those

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
25 23 checks that are useful to spot

194
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,620
this your ice spoofing attack

195
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,720
um what's interesting about this is if

196
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,819
you think about the last attack we had a

197
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,340
very useful check of looking for a green

198
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,080
bar that says this is a good signature

199
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,660
if you try to apply this check to this

200
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,880
kind of attack this can actually be

201
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
harmful this can be actively misleading

202
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,300
because now you see a green bar that

203
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,039
says it's a good signature when actually

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,139
we just spoofed it right

205
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,720
cool so the last two attacks we just

206
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,240
call them conflicting signer attacks for

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
these there was just one checks that's

208
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,919
actually useful and this is that you

209
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,720
have to compare the sender which is in

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
the from header up there

211
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,520
um which here is Bob and you compare it

212
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,379
to the signer which shows up in the

213
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,720
enact mail bar which in this case would

214
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
be Celine right so this email was sent

215
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
by Bob but it was signed by Celine this

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
doesn't make sense this is a way to spot

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
this kind of attack

218
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,860
all right on to the next question well

219
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,320
now overall how successful were our

220
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
expert users and actually detecting all

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,559
of the attacks

222
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,120
um all right so it turns out we managed

223
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,100
to fool about half of them which was

224
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,560
quite surprising um so 52 of

225
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,120
participants fell for at least one

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,360
attack if you break down that

227
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,399
um 0.76 successful attacks per

228
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,220
participant on average with a standard

229
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,620
derivation of just about one so this

230
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,060
means that the majority of our

231
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,880
participants either got zero one or two

232
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,660
emails that were able to fool them right

233
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,040
all right

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,500
um we come to the end uh what did we try

235
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,019
to do we tried we set out to find an

236
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,080
upper Bound for detecting these weak

237
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,000
signature forgeries this is why we

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,279
talked to expert users and this is why

239
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,100
we actively primed our participants to

240
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,980
actively look for attacks in these

241
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,860
emails that they got to look at

242
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,779
um all right so it turns out not even

243
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,839
our group of expert users was able to

244
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,300
spot attacks reliably

245
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,320
um

246
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,940
right this is what we found so what now

247
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,399
what do we do about this

248
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,959
um we got two things one thing is short

249
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,360
term right we need to if you want to fix

250
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,800
this you need to reduce the complexity

251
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,480
of checking signatures right quite

252
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,399
obvious usability stuff you want to have

253
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,560
useful checks that are easy and fast to

254
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
make ideally you just have one simple

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,540
smart indicator element instead of like

256
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,220
having five or six different things you

257
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,500
have to look out for every new email

258
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,080
that you get all right the other thing

259
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,899
is about consistency right right now if

260
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,820
you look at an unsigned email message in

261
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,320
Thunderbird

262
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,420
um there's no statement about the

263
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,839
security of this email at all and this

264
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,940
could lead to trouble which is why we

265
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,940
advise that the long-term solution that

266
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,880
we actually if we want to increase the

267
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,279
security regarding

268
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:29,880
um

269
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,060
is signed emails right email signatures

270
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,339
and we have to work towards the secure

271
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,100
way becoming the default way

272
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,820
um

273
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,500
right because if we just start throwing

274
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,660
warnings into users faces for every

275
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,480
unsigned email they get we basically

276
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,860
lose them because they stop carrying

277
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,120
super fast this is called warning

278
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,180
fatigue and you basically gain nothing

279
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,459
from that so but at the same time if you

280
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,279
look at it from a security perspective

281
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,720
you have this mismatch of when warnings

282
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,820
are shown and when not so like I said

283
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,980
for unsigned messages there's no one is

284
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,279
at all but for signed messages

285
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,320
messages that have a signature attached

286
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,200
that got invalidated by something be it

287
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,880
like a male Gateway that just messed

288
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,220
with matters in some way and then you

289
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,540
have an email under the signature

290
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,640
attached to us and if it's invalid you

291
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,620
get this huge warning

292
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,720
um or a red warning or something that

293
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,160
the interface tells you that something

294
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
is wrong with this email and this is a

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,959
mismatch right if you think about it the

296
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,360
email with the message attached to it is

297
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,959
in no way more or is in no way less

298
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,519
secure even if the signature is broken

299
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,920
than an unsigned email overall and this

300
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,959
is mismatch and to solve this we

301
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,579
actually have to work towards and find

302
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,040
new ways

303
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,800
to help make the secure way become the

304
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,140
default way in email signatures

305
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,760
all right that's it thank you for your

306
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,500
attention and feel free to talk to us on

307
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,740
the break
