1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,300
so welcome to my talk and this is going

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,000
to be on the topic of Internet voting

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the challenges that can happen with

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,060
this so this is the collaboration with

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,460
University of Castle Institute of

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,680
Technology in Germany and I am from the

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,199
at University in Copenhagen Denmark

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,300
so internet voting it has been widely

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,220
discussed especially during the pandemic

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,559
and it has in fact been used in several

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,300
countries for political legally binding

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,219
elections so this is not new

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,739
and despite the several advantages of

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,059
Internet voting of course it has

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,100
security concerns and one of the biggest

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,320
one is the fact that there is and

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
potentially insecure watching client so

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,100
the assumption is the voters use their

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,660
personal devices their laptops their

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,940
smartphones and what can happen for

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,440
example if the attacker manages to

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,180
infiltrate this device for example by

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,000
installing the malware on water's laptop

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
two things can happen in this example

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,199
first of all assuming the water goes to

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,080
the election website and selects that

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,479
choice party a that I can might know

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,820
that the water has voted for party a and

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,740
what that else can do is that they can

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,960
just motivate motiv modify their vote

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
from party a to the vote for party B so

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,340
unless there are specific ways for the

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,320
voters to verify that indeed the right

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,700
vote has been submitted to the voting

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,220
system the water will be manipulated

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,799
without the water snowing so this is the

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,780
biggest challenge in Internet voting and

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,640
it hasn't indeed been addressed quite

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
extensively in the election security

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,579
community

42
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,799
in particular one of the

43
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,820
proposals to solve this problem or at

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,759
least to mitigate these risks would be a

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,799
return code base verifiability

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,479
now the way it works and this is a very

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
simplified description is that before

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
the election the voters get the paper

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,820
code sheets

50
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,920
where each working option in this case

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,899
party a and party B are assigned a

52
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,820
specific voting code so this vote in a

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,040
return code so this return codes are

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,540
unique to the voter and to the voting

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,219
option the assumption is they are only

56
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,840
their secret and only the voters know

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,098
these codes

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,139
so what the water does the water goes to

59
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,060
the election website chooses their

60
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,540
choice party a the vote is transferred

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,520
to the election system and the election

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,739
system outputs the return code

63
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,020
so in this case the voting device or the

64
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,700
voting website outputs the return code

65
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,680
as well and the voters can check yes so

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
this code 6439 is indeed the code that

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,540
is on party a which means that the vote

68
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,340
for party a has been recorded on my

69
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,360
behalf

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,340
so in this case even if the attacker

71
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,780
manages to

72
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,180
infect the voting device there is no way

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,860
they're going to know the validation

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,900
code unless they actually submit the

75
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,640
vote for party a that the voter has

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
intended

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,760
so at this point what might say that the

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,860
problem with vote Integrity in in

79
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,080
presence of malicious voting device has

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
kind of been solved at least to some

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,760
extent and indeed this approach um

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,379
relies on the what is being able to

83
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,599
detect manipulations and it has been

84
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,700
used in elections in Switzerland for

85
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,239
example so this is tested in practice

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,040
now still on problem remains and this is

87
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,239
the problem with the word secrecy

88
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,680
because once again if the attacker

89
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,659
somehow controls the voting device it is

90
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,220
possible that they still will be able to

91
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,720
find out that the water has voted for

92
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,280
party a

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,080
and the solution for this has also been

94
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,420
proposed and the so-called verifiable

95
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,580
code voting and again this is not new

96
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,379
this has been proposed in the literature

97
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,019
since um 20 years

98
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,000
the idea is as follows again a very

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
simplified description before the

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,300
election the voter gets again the code

101
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,920
sheets with return calls as explained

102
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,319
before but now the water also has the

103
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,879
so-called voting codes for each voting

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
option again the assumption is these

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,299
codes are secret and not only to the

106
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,140
water

107
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,879
and what the water does when they

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
watched award for party a they instead

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,799
of entering just this optional plain

110
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,299
text they enter their corresponding code

111
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,099
the code gets transferred to the voting

112
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,440
system and the voting system outputs the

113
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
return code as before so that the water

114
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,519
can compare that indeed this return code

115
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,500
corresponds to party a

116
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,319
so in this case in this case if this

117
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,360
actually works in practice then what

118
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,700
Integrity is solved and of course under

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,220
the assumption that the codes are secret

120
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,659
and the word secrecy problem is also

121
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,159
sold because the attacker only sees the

122
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
code that has been transferred but not

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,899
um the actual voting option

124
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,579
so again this solution is not new it has

125
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,139
been known and discussed and iterated

126
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,000
over 20 years

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,979
however it has not been used for actual

128
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,020
real world elections and one of the

129
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,940
concerns is the usability so would the

130
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,160
waters actually be able to

131
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
use the voting system if they have to

132
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,940
enter codes instead of just choosing

133
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,740
their button option

134
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,540
and this is the problem we attempted to

135
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,880
solve in our work in particular we made

136
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
the volume proposal how to make this

137
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
verifiable code vote in more use more

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,139
usable

139
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,660
and what we propose is that instead of

140
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,460
the voters entering their codes manually

141
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,100
they rely on QR codes and how it can

142
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,419
look like is that before the election

143
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,880
the voters get voting cards one voting

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
card for each option on the front side

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,479
of the voting card there is the QR code

146
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,240
encoding the voting code and on this

147
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,280
back side there is the version optional

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,740
plain text and the return code

149
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,600
the water in order to avoid the users

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,460
the water uses some device such as

151
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,900
smartphone or other device that is

152
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,660
capable of scanning QR codes that will

153
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,160
just cancel the QR code of their chosen

154
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,440
voting card the voting device transfers

155
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,820
the corresponding course the voting

156
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,919
system and the voting system Returns the

157
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,419
return code which the voters can then

158
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,979
verify

159
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,720
so this is in a nutshell our proposal

160
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,460
again very simplified if you look at the

161
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,960
paper you see it's more complicated than

162
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,000
this but this is the main idea

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,460
and if it actually works then again we

164
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,199
have the advantage of what integrity and

165
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,419
what secrecy being protected

166
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,280
and given this proposal the research

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,139
questions we focused on in our work is

168
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,300
first of all is it actually usable so we

169
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,580
wanted to get some idea of what the

170
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,840
system is ability to score for this

171
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,000
proposal is and then we actually wanted

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,380
to see whether the voters are able to

173
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,120
detect manipulations of their boat using

174
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,860
this system

175
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,440
and the topic of manipulation can be

176
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,479
tricky and the type of manipulation we

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,699
looked in our work is as follows

178
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,320
so imagine there isn't it an attacker

179
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
controlling the water smartphone which

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,620
they used to vote

181
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,380
the water was a procedure I described

182
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,840
above they scanned the QR code on the

183
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,539
corresponding voting card

184
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,280
um what the attacker can do assuming the

185
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,320
attacker wants to just block the boats

186
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,940
so they want to make sure that this

187
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,800
water this particular water does not get

188
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,259
included in the talium so the attacker

189
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,639
does not forward the vote the voting

190
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,680
system now the attack of course has a

191
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,060
problem that they don't have the right

192
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,460
return code so what should what can they

193
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,240
do

194
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,979
they can do as follows

195
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,080
they can manipulate the interfaces of

196
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,880
the vertices of the voting clients or

197
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
the for example of the election website

198
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,479
because as you recall the assumption is

199
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,280
the control the voted clients

200
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,319
and what they can do is that instead of

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,759
outputting the return code which they

202
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,620
don't have they output some generic

203
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,759
message like thank you for your watch

204
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,500
you're now you're now done

205
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,600
and that I can hope that if the water is

206
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,919
not very familiar with the verification

207
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
procedure the water will think okay they

208
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,940
are done and not do anything else and

209
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,039
not Trace any alarms so the attacker

210
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,039
would succeed manipulating the vote um

211
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
without actually

212
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,199
knowing the return codes

213
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,120
so what secrecy Still Remains intact

214
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,919
because still the attacker only sees the

215
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,080
codes but Integrity might be violated if

216
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
the voters don't notice this kind of

217
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,479
manipulation

218
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
so the question we wanted to answer is

219
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,039
how dangerous is this will the waters be

220
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,419
actually able to detect that something

221
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,460
goes wrong in this case

222
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,440
and in order to conduct this we have

223
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,020
done an online study which is which had

224
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,199
two groups one group of participants

225
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,160
interacted with the mock-up of this

226
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,080
voting system without any kind of

227
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,819
manipulations so the purpose was to see

228
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,319
how usable the system under normal

229
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,740
conditions is and the second group was

230
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,539
subjected to simulated manipulations as

231
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,400
described before so the purpose was to

232
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,259
see whether they detected or not

233
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,819
so the study design was as follows

234
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,919
before the study the water services

235
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,960
materials for a postal service so we

236
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,660
conducted a study during covet and which

237
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,520
is why we did not we could not invite

238
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,380
them into our lab so we had to conduct

239
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,240
the study remotely so send out the

240
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,120
materials before the study and they were

241
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,039
I studied the materials which concluded

242
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,300
of General instructions information

243
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,699
about the study of the Roll cult telling

244
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,560
them that they are the vote in this

245
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,240
election and they should they intend to

246
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
vote for this particular option

247
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
and it will it also included to watching

248
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,860
materials including voting cards and

249
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,180
some other materials that are relevant

250
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,220
for the election

251
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,020
so after doing this they were just

252
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,759
constructed to cast the vote according

253
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,500
to a Daryl cult and using the mock-up of

254
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,179
the system we developed

255
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,279
and depending on whether the voters were

256
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,380
subjected to manipulation or not

257
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,899
um the rest procedure was as follows if

258
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,339
the participants were in a group without

259
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,099
manipulation then after completing the

260
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,480
broadcast and they were forwarded to the

261
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,740
survey where they were asked the

262
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,300
questionnaire from the system usability

263
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,220
scale and some other feedback about the

264
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,519
system if the voters were indeed

265
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,380
subjected to the manipulation they had

266
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,360
two options so on the sorted materials

267
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,600
we had a support number

268
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,060
and we told the so the materials would

269
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,440
say the water If you experience any

270
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
problems call this number and tell us

271
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,680
what this is so this number actually

272
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
belongs to the person who has conducted

273
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
the study so that participants could

274
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,779
actually call the number

275
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,459
so the management manipulation was

276
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,700
introduced and if the participant has

277
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,959
called this number

278
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
so they have reported the manipulation

279
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,779
they were

280
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,580
sorry if they were not if they did not

281
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,959
call this number it did not report the

282
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,940
manipulation they were forwarded to the

283
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,740
debriefing survey and so they were told

284
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,480
that indeed there was a manipulation and

285
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,920
asked some questions about the

286
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,720
experience with the system

287
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,339
if the water cell called this number

288
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,899
they were debrised on the phone so they

289
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:40,980
were told that actually this

290
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,959
manipulation is deliberate that they

291
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
have noticed and then we're once again

292
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,019
forwarded to the final survey with

293
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,459
questions about the experience with the

294
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,579
system

295
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,260
so our results for as follows uh 65

296
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,120
participants interacted with the system

297
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,940
I was with all without manipulations and

298
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,860
these were the results so disability

299
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,459
score was uh kind of high 82 out of 100

300
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,620
which is usually considered very good so

301
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,200
at least we can we could kind of hope

302
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
that the system isn't it usable the

303
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,860
manipulation detection was not that

304
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,620
great so only 41 of the participants

305
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,640
were actually able to detect

306
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,080
manipulation

307
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,240
now this does not look great indeed

308
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,760
however when we look at similar studies

309
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
that also look at

310
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,480
systems with similar mechanisms for

311
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,760
verification we see that They Don't

312
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,220
Really perform any better so for example

313
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,200
studies done with the original Swissport

314
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,459
system

315
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,019
only had 10 percent of participants

316
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,480
detecting such kind of manipulations and

317
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,420
in a modification of the support system

318
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,399
43 participants did it so at least our

319
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,380
proposal did not do much worse or did

320
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,300
not do worse than their proposal from

321
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,560
previous work

322
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,420
yet it still has an advantage of

323
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,519
security because our proposal utilizes

324
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,980
verifiable code voting so under the

325
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,420
assumption that voting devices can be

326
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,399
compromised still about integrity and

327
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
what secrecy is protected while uh with

328
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,380
the two other evaluated systems

329
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,180
um only what Integrity will be protected

330
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,980
but if the voting device is compromised

331
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,180
then what secrecy can also be

332
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,339
compromised

333
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,540
right so to summarize we have proposed

334
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,880
system for verifiable code voting and we

335
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
have shown that it can indeed be usable

336
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,440
uh what we still can work on is to

337
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,820
further improve the manipulation

338
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,519
detection rate because still as you see

339
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
40 being able to detect manipulation is

340
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
not great so maybe something can be done

341
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,339
to improve this

342
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,740
and another version of future work is to

343
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,300
focus on systematically testing for

344
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,519
these manipulations because we came up

345
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,560
with one way the attacker can can modify

346
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,320
the water interfaces to see if it works

347
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,060
or not but maybe there are more

348
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,740
systematic ways to come up with all kind

349
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,480
of different ways that the attackers can

350
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,399
do to kind of deceive the waters into

351
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,600
not completing the verification

352
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
procedure

353
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,500
all right so this was it

354
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,079
um again I'm presenting here

355
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,060
only a part of what we have done in this

356
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,260
works so if you're interested to know

357
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,300
more please leave the please read the

358
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,579
paper and please come talk to me in the

359
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,200
breaks and for now thank you for your

360
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,360
attention I'm happy to hear questions
