00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,160
hello I'm Tara Whelan from cloudflare

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,259
research and on behalf of my co-authors

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,299
I'm pleased to present our work on

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,340
attestation as a usable captcha

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,320
alternative

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,699
and many of us are familiar with

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,400
captchas the challenges that websites

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,400
present in order to differentiate humans

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
from bots in order to cut down on online

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,880
abuse

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,800
we're likely also familiar with many of

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,559
the problems of captchas they provide

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,020
burdens on users who have to perform

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,239
extra tasks that are often frustrating

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,180
they lead to poor accessibility causing

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,620
problems for users with disabilities

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,440
they may rely on cultural knowledge that

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,960
is far from Universal and they can lead

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,940
to poor experience for example on mobile

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,680
devices that have small screens

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,000
if we look to what design goals might be

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,739
for better captchas

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,739
we want to support strong security

25
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,300
ideally you have a challenge task that

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,979
has no solution without there being a

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,200
human being involved you want to

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,939
maintain strong privacy so your

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,200
challenge should reveal minimal

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,659
information about users and could not be

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,000
used to support tracking

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,619
and ideally you would like strong

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,380
usability so that a user can demonstrate

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,240
that they are a person with minimal

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,460
burden

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,320
our proposal is the cryptographic

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,259
attestation of personhood or cap

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,360
the basic idea is that a person

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,520
physically interacts with a piece of

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,680
secure Hardware to provide a strong

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,979
reliable signal that they are not a bot

42
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,380
the requirements for this are to have an

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,420
authenticator this is a piece of secure

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,220
Hardware generally a commercially

45
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,560
available piece of Hardware like a USB

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,500
secure key or a fingerprint reader on a

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,020
phone and a test of user presence so

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,119
this is a physical gesture such as

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,479
touching a security key

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,640
it also involves the web authentication

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,939
API standard and attestation which is a

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,100
cryptographic proof that uses a public

53
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
key that's signed by a trusted

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,720
manufacturer of secure hardware and I'll

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,580
describe how each of these pieces work

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,459
in a moment

57
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,739
the web authentication API or web authen

58
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,140
is an open standard from the w3c and

59
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,020
Fido which you may have encountered for

60
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,879
multi-factor authentication for example

61
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,420
adding a security key to a user account

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,520
it has two ceremonies there's a

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,040
registration in which the key is set up

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,739
and authentication for the subsequent

65
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,260
login well note that cap does not use

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,900
the login flow it uses the registration

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,140
phase to obtain the attestation only and

68
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,660
does not involve any user data

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,180
we've modified the flow slightly so that

70
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,040
the server requests the attestation from

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,140
the client without being prompted by a

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,180
username

73
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,700
I'll give a very brief overview of the

74
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,560
cryptographic attestation

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
in brief the user is asked to prove that

76
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,580
they are in control of a public key

77
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,340
signed by a trusted manufacturer so this

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,680
is the attestation it is generated by

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,599
the device using a hardware embedded

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,480
secret key and so what is provided is a

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,459
digital signature that uses a private

82
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,459
key that's held in a secure Enclave in

83
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,800
the secure Hardware as well as a

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,120
certificate chain that leads to the

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,180
manufacturer so then a message that is

86
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,159
received by the website they can believe

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,140
has been a trustworthy message that has

88
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,940
been created by the secure Hardware

89
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,099
providing the signal of the person's

90
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,260
Humanity

91
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,940
so what this provides is security

92
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,980
against bots the cryptographic

93
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,440
attestation can only be generated by the

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
physical interaction with the trusted

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,860
hardware and cannot be automatically

96
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,840
generated through software

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,120
it also provides privacy protections

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
I'll note that the attestation does

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,200
reveal a hard-coded certificate

100
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,299
associated with the device class but

101
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,280
this is not unique the Fido standard

102
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,799
anticipated this as a privacy issue and

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,599
the standard requires that at least a

104
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,340
hundred thousand devices share the same

105
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,379
attestation certificate so the

106
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,060
information that is disclosed is limited

107
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,040
to the type of device and its batch or

108
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,599
model so your key cannot be

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,220
distinguished from a hundred thousand

110
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,080
others

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,659
I'll give a short demo that will show

112
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,519
what the user would experience while

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,858
verifying with cap

114
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,478
you've come to the challenge page and

115
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,040
note the button that says verify with

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,460
cap clicking on that will bring up a

117
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,020
pop-up in which you choose the device

118
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,240
that you wish to use for example the USB

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
security key

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,440
you will then do the interaction with

121
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,080
the key for example touching it

122
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,840
here's where the attestation occurs in

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
which the website wants to see the make

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,800
and model of the security key

125
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,620
and if this is successful then your user

126
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,540
is verified and they're allowed to

127
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,120
proceed to the website

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,340
we did an evaluation of the usability of

129
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,500
cap initially with a feasibility study

130
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,540
of 17 users with Yuba Keys which was

131
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,620
promising

132
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,060
people were able to complete the task

133
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,800
quickly with few errors and it showed

134
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,259
strong user satisfaction so building on

135
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,180
this we launched some public demos with

136
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,100
accompanying blog posts to explain the

137
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,740
technology with an initial launch and

138
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,320
then an expanded launch that extended

139
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
the number of authenticators that were

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,220
accepted and we collected detailed

141
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,520
feedback from these demos

142
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,340
we logged data when people attempted to

143
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,680
verify on the public demo over eight

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,220
days in August 2021 we collected 1896

145
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,960
user sessions these sessions could

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
include both successful and failed

147
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,220
verification attempts and we collected

148
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,160
task timing data and error data noting

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,020
we did have minimal data collection

150
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,060
because we were mindful of participants

151
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,699
privacy concerns

152
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,680
the bean task completion time for cap

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
and this includes time to click and read

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,960
through all pop-ups as well as to

155
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,419
interact with the device was 10.6

156
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,280
seconds for a successful verification

157
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
and 2.8 seconds for a failed

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
verification which you would fail out of

159
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,340
very quickly

160
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,919
for comparison an H captcha with a three

161
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,020
by three picture grid

162
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,639
takes on average 24.5 seconds so cap is

163
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,460
significantly faster

164
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,039
in terms of the success rate of the

165
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,080
sessions that we analyzed

166
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,840
48.5 percent included a successful

167
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,419
validation and the majority of these had

168
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,100
no errors

169
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,020
when looking at potential sources of

170
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,000
failed validation note that we have a

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
limited visibility into what was

172
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,440
happening in this real world study

173
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,479
but of course real world interactions

174
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,280
are more subject to error than

175
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,960
controlled lab studies for example

176
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,520
people may just fail to complete the

177
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,780
attempt by walking away from their

178
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,819
computer the survey data that we also

179
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,080
collected suggests there could be

180
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
problems from the user environment for

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,460
example the attestation requirements may

182
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,020
not be met because the person may not

183
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,060
have the required secure Hardware or the

184
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,039
correct combination of hardware and

185
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,039
browser needed to successfully verify

186
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,400
themselves

187
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,319
when users completed a verification

188
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,120
attempt they could elect to complete a

189
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,360
survey and we had 93 responses

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,100
we had a series of five-point liquor

191
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,400
scales and note that when asked if they

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,380
were likely to use cap if they had the

193
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,020
security key or a biometric sensor the

194
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,180
vast majority 75 percent agreed or

195
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,400
strongly agreed and similarly stated

196
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,800
that they would prefer using this as a

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,599
method of verification over other

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,160
captures

199
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,039
76 also were frustrated as to how often

200
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,599
they had to prove that they were a human

201
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,759
and note that a smaller majority also

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,380
stated that they were confident the cap

203
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,580
preserved their privacy

204
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,020
we also asked for additional feedback

205
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,599
about people's experiences their

206
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,979
strengths and weaknesses and any

207
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,539
additional feedback and they had the

208
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,580
option to provide more details about

209
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,259
their system

210
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,780
the most commonly cited strengths were

211
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,599
the ease of use and the speed and the

212
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,940
Improvement of cap over other types of

213
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,800
challenges for example having to select

214
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,060
buses and trucks

215
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,860
we also wanted to find out people's

216
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,319
ability to use cap noting that secure

217
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,180
Hardware is widely available but is not

218
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,220
yet Universal and as previously

219
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,900
mentioned some combinations of

220
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,780
authenticators and browsers do not work

221
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,500
for cap and this was expressed by the

222
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,300
responses to the survey as well

223
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,340
and because privacy concerns we'll note

224
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,020
that of course protections are strong in

225
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,059
this case but they are complex and hard

226
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,979
to communicate and there can be

227
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,719
confusion over what exactly is being

228
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,520
transmitted from the authenticator and

229
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,799
people may be afraid that this

230
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,839
information is used to track them

231
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,040
and there are lots of challenges around

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
communication cap is of course a novel

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,420
way of verifying personhood that is not

234
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,519
always easy to explain for example how

235
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,320
to easily communicate what the necessary

236
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,060
system requirements are in order for you

237
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,700
to use it also the design is constrained

238
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,399
by how browsers Implement web authen

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,040
for example the user experience may be

240
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,600
confusing because the pop-ups that are

241
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,540
designed usually for user logins to an

242
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,060
account do not apply to the cap use case

243
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,920
and web authent itself has a lot of

244
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,620
usability challenges as expressed by our

245
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
respondents who could find some of the

246
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,880
messages confusing

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,160
so in summary the verification task was

248
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,500
completed quickly those users that had

249
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,120
the supported hardware and software were

250
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
able to validate easily with the

251
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
majority of survey respondents

252
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,860
indicating they were likely to use cap

253
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,779
if they had the necessary Hardware which

254
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,060
suggests the cap is good solution in the

255
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,100
right circumstances and it's best

256
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,660
positioned as an alternative challenge

257
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,880
method and perhaps not the sole

258
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,519
challenge option

259
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,620
to return to security considerations

260
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,779
it's of course difficult to balance

261
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,700
security and usability there's a bit of

262
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,760
an arms race and we need to monitor

263
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
how abuse and attacks will shift in

264
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,480
response to putting cap into the

265
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,500
ecosystem

266
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,240
there's always the possibility that

267
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,760
there could be capture Farms that could

268
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,459
have automated button pressing systems

269
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,440
for example to

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,620
defeat the cap system a note that cap is

271
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,600
part of Defense in depth it is one

272
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,220
strong signal but of course can be

273
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,380
combined with other signals for a more

274
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,019
robust security solution

275
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,080
next steps for cap are revising the

276
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
interface and the experience to provide

277
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,620
clear communication on these challenges

278
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,540
and to continue our evaluation and

279
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,399
Analysis particularly around monitoring

280
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,980
the security of the challenges and to

281
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,200
dive further into usability including

282
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,560
looking at accessibility concerns

283
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,420
I'd like to thank my collaborators on
