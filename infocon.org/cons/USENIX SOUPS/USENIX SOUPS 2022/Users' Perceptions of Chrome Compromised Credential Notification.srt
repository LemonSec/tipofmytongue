00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,380
I'm a PhD candidate at the University of

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,759
British Columbia

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,100
today I'll be having my colleagues I'm

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,380
presenting our paper called users

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,480
perceptions of Chrome's compromised

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,720
credential notification

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
the West spread availability of

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,699
usernames and passwords exposed by Gator

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,040
Bridges remains a big threat to users

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,899
and organizations

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,120
linked credentials can cause users

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
allowed problems for instance if your

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,920
accounts are being hijacked you just got

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,480
lost access to their important

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,520
information and may suffer from

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,500
Financial loss

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,620
a response service providers started for

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,719
learning users when their credentials

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,420
appear in purchase the services include

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,539
websites like have impound browsers and

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,559
Standalone password managers

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,660
Google for instance alerts Chrome users

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,780
if any username password pairs save in

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,600
their Google account has been breached

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,659
whenever a user signs into or registers

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,060
on our website a pop-up notification is

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,159
triggered if the credentials used have

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,680
been found in the data Bridge

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,960
millions of users have received such

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,240
notifications yet in the user's

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,939
perceptions especially the issues and

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,580
concerns they may have has not been

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,540
studied

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,479
therefore we conducted an investigation

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,520
to learn about users challenges with

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,340
this notification

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,920
we use the two-step approach to gather

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,619
users perceptions first we gathered

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,040
users reviews feedback comments and

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,560
support requests post are posted on

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,720
online platforms

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,180
we employed a keyword searching method

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,759
to search the Chrome help center using

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,860
several keywords such as password

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,380
notification we also use the Google

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,600
search engine to search the web for the

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,820
same keywords we were able to get our

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,619
users comments from various online

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,399
platforms

51
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,780
we didn't conducted semi-structured

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,180
interviews with users who had received

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,860
such a notification

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,739
the interviews served as a complimentary

55
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,840
approach to better explore user's

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
reasons for their concerns challenges

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,500
and actions regarding the notification

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,319
we've recruited a diverse set of 22

59
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,180
interview participants from North

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,120
America example varied in age occupation

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,239
and education level

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,640
our results suggest that users issues

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,760
with notifications are many associated

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,280
with five core aspects of the

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,319
notification

66
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,540
in this presentation I will focus on

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,459
introducing the challenges with these

68
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,980
two aspects

69
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,200
regarding Google's knowledge of users

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,140
compromised credentials users expressed

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,420
five concerns about it

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,660
first users wanted more clarification

73
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,940
about how Google knows their credentials

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,019
were leaked

75
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,560
this perceived non-transparency reduce

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,959
our users trust in Google for instance

77
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,480
online comment user protein once did it

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,819
if Google truly cared or thought they

79
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,080
were being helpful they wouldn't

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
consider Great Lengths to help the

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,480
details about their operation

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,760
we also found that poorly informed users

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,159
formed a hypothesis that Chrome checks

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,260
uses plain tests credentials to

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,140
facilitate the notification

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,360
we don't discover that some online

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,400
command users and participants believed

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,319
Google checked to your credentials even

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,238
if they were not sick in Google account

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,140
meanwhile I'll be leaving Google track

91
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,959
users message credentials online comedy

92
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,580
users and participants raised

93
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,040
corresponding privacy customers

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,260
for instance online comment user to

95
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,260
proposted it getting the message about a

96
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,120
bridge might seem helpful but

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,220
considering how the learning game and

98
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,260
what Google has to be doing to ISO

99
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,220
domain it is just creepy

100
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,620
last several online comment users

101
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,060
dislike Google checking their

102
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,160
credentials without asking for consent

103
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,858
first they felt like that they had lost

104
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,359
control over their own data

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,520
next I will introduce the challenges

106
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,800
associated with to action recommend date

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,620
backup notification

108
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,080
upon receiving the notification users

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,580
are recommended to change their

110
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,220
passwords right away however we found

111
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,199
users had many challenges with this

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,960
recommended action we'll use we'll

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
introduce three of the challenges here

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,479
first online comment users and

115
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,060
participants wanted to know if it would

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,340
be a significant risk if they decided

117
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,620
not to change passwords they also wanted

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,600
to know if there could be other security

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,199
problems by now changing the password

120
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,300
the risk level was perceived as helpful

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,759
for users to decide if it is worth

122
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,800
making a lot of efforts to change the

123
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,280
passwords

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
participants wanted more clarification

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,540
about why changing the password is the

126
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,120
best practice and what risks would be

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,160
avoided by doing so

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,380
such information could influence their

129
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,380
risk management behaviors for instance

130
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,479
participants extended I would like to

131
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,639
know if the best you can do is just

132
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,280
change passwords

133
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,560
we also discovered that online comment

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
users and participants lack of

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,060
motivations to change their passwords to

136
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,699
argue that the notification alerts them

137
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,220
about something that may not happen such

138
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,960
as account hijacking

139
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,419
so the time to delay or not take actions

140
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,600
now I will introduce uh some takeaways

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,100
from this study

142
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,320
first critical information about the

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,500
notification was perceived as missing or

144
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,380
not easily accessible to users

145
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,780
for instance information about the data

146
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,940
bridge in which users credentials were

147
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,280
leaked or perceived missing on the

148
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
notification and the users were unclear

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,139
about how Google learns about their

150
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,259
leaked credentials

151
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,600
we therefore suggest providing essential

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,580
information about the notification to

153
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,460
users perhaps in a layered column

154
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,680
a layered approach can potentially

155
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,440
enable the notification to convey a

156
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,660
large amount of relevant information to

157
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,600
users without overwhelming them

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,580
also with all the relevant information

159
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,039
linked directly through the layered

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,800
approach users could find answers to all

161
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,620
your questions without asking help some

162
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,600
somewhere else

163
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,759
another potential advantage of this

164
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,340
layered approach is that it may benefit

165
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,280
different types of users each user could

166
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,139
decide how much information they would

167
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,520
want when learning about a modification

168
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,039
second takeaway is that users face many

169
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,600
challenges in understanding the

170
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
multiplication

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,160
their lack of knowledge may result in

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,280
misinterpretations and users May develop

173
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,020
misunderstanding of certain aspects of

174
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,419
the notification

175
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,099
to better help users understand the

176
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,220
notification we suggest correcting users

177
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,500
misunderstandings by providing detailed

178
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,000
explanations

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,220
for instance instead of saying that

180
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,919
Google does not access users plain tests

181
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,500
test first the notification can focus on

182
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,840
clarifying how Google learns that users

183
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,400
credentials were linked without

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,419
accessing their credentials

185
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,360
the next takeaway is that instructions

186
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,699
such as changing passwords were not

187
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,139
being helpful

188
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,240
polite comment users and participants

189
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,220
experience many challenges regarding

190
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,340
taking the recommended actions

191
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,620
to have better help users mitigate a

192
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,440
risk we suggest that more explanations

193
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,539
should be provided in the instructions

194
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,419
for example to justify the necessity of

195
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,300
changing the password

196
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,460
specifically we recommend explaining why

197
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,560
it is necessary to change the bridges

198
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,139
Abridged password but not the username

199
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,160
but risk can and I cannot be mitigated

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,039
by this action and what risks future may

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,840
face if you do not change the passwords

202
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,419
some users privacy and security concerns

203
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,000
were related to Google they criticized

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,219
the company for having too much control

205
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,640
over users data not being just parents

206
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,620
about managing users data and

207
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,958
facilitating scams

208
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,660
but therefore suggest to give users more

209
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,060
control over their data for instance you

210
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,399
just could be given the choice to select

211
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,380
and deselect accounts that they want to

212
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,100
receive notifications about bridges

213
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,560
in summary we discovered that users

214
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,660
challenges with Chrome's compromise

215
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,240
credential notification were associated

216
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
with five aspects of the notification

217
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,100
but therefore made the suggestion to

218
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,680
improve the design of various aspects of

219
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,200
the notification to support users in

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
better protecting their online accounts

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
this concludes my presentation I'm more

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,700
than happy to answer any questions now
