from the University of Waterloo I

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,059
representing our work sharing without

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,460
scaring enabling smartphones to become

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,220
aware of temporary sharing this is a

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
joint world with doctors Hank Gardner

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,619
and Dr Hassan Hassan

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,420
temporary device sharing is a common

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,939
activity where device owner shares their

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,880
device with another person called Sherry

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
people share their devices for help

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,559
convenience or social purposes

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,020
for example people may hand their

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,120
smartphones to their friends for sharing

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,520
videos or they may ask a stranger to

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,780
take a photo

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,120
however device owners have privacy

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,820
concerns since service May access their

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,739
personal data or perform sensitive

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,059
operations

21
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,539
to prevent an authorized access owners

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,180
May supervise the sharing process for

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,460
adult sharing protection Solutions

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,559
because device sharing is also a social

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,619
activity it's social implications

26
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,900
including trust relationships and the

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,119
impact of cultural differences also

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,280
affect people's sharing practices and

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,540
even the design of the sharing

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,820
protection Solutions

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,220
existing sharing protection Solutions

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,740
mainly focus on access control

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,200
for example guest accounts provide

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,780
shares with an isolated environment to

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,600
prevent all access to the owner's data

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
but it is also convenient to share

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
single files

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,840
ad pinning is provided as system feature

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,680
on Android and iOS it allows the Sherry

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,500
to access the current APP only

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,079
without an app lock are the common

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
Solutions on markets that provide fine

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,240
grind access control over single files

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,420
or apps they enable owners to high

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,579
sensitive resources and enforce

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,820
authentication before the access

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,399
however many of these Solutions require

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,700
many activation before device sharing an

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,380
owner may fail to enable sharing

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,959
protection for many reasons first device

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,599
sharing is usually casual and implant

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,000
and owner may forget to enable the

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
protection before handing the device to

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,420
a Chevy

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,819
and sometimes people are even unaware of

56
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,680
the risks of exposing sensitive

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,080
resources during sharing more

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,300
importantly explicitly highly

59
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,819
information May signal mistrust to the

60
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,459
to the Chevy and lead to negative impact

61
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,940
on social relationships

62
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,459
to avoid these situations a desired

63
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,500
sharing protection solution should be

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,260
able to proactively and also immensely

65
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,300
detect the sharing events and secure

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,280
sensitive resources

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,980
so we propose device sharing awareness

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,420
DSA

69
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,239
the key of DSA is to determine when to

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,459
activate and deactive data sharing

71
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,720
protection

72
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,879
here we use a stage transition diagram

73
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,160
to describe as Behavior

74
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,980
initially the devices in a normal State

75
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,800
indicating that the owner is currently

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,360
using a device

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,879
when a sharing event is detected the

78
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,800
system moves from the normal state to

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,500
the sharing State and

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,019
and at this stage the sharing can only

81
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,659
access non-sensitive resources

82
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,519
and after the share we finished using

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
the device and returns it DSA needs to

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,099
verify the owner's identity to move back

85
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,440
to the normal state

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
the log state has entered in two

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,420
situations one is that a Sherry performs

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,060
any potential violations like attempting

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,580
to access sensitive resources and the

90
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,440
other situation is that the owner

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,739
manually leaves the sharing state

92
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,739
in both scenarios a user is required to

93
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,080
pass the user authentication to leave

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
the log state

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,799
and next we let's move to the details

96
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,319
about the sharing detection

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,080
first we propose sharing gesture

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,840
detection to capture the owner's actions

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,360
that indicate a sharing bet

100
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,239
in DSA we focus on hand over gestures

101
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,939
where an owner passes the device to a

102
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,879
Chevy backhand so DSA collects the

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,978
motion data from built-in motion sensors

104
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,918
and the extracts of both time domain and

105
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,560
frequency domain features over segments

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,780
there's an overlap between average who's

107
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,120
consecutive segments to cover the

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Handover patterns

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,040
and then we apply a sliding window to

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,259
perform detection over multiple segments

111
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,979
to reduce the false detection rates

112
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,840
the Handover model needs to distinguish

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,300
Handover gestures from other similar

114
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,240
movements like a device rotations or a

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,520
single user switching hands and to

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
reduce the user's efforts in training

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,419
the Handover models we choose to portray

118
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,840
a model that work across different users

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,720
moreover we adopt the Adaptive sensing

120
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,360
to reduce the power consumption where

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,220
the handle detection is only activated

122
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,660
when a significant movement is detected

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,300
next is the owner detection

124
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,000
the basic idea is to verify the owner's

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
identity to confirm that the device has

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,699
been returned to the owner at the end of

127
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,259
a sharing event

128
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,540
we use behavioral biometrics-based in

129
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,900
place authentication for owner detection

130
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,600
this enables TSA to distinguish users

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,139
based on how they swipe or type on a

132
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,340
touch screen

133
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,740
and perform continuous and transparent

134
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,740
identity verification in the background

135
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,840
in addition to ending and sharing event

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,139
the results of only detection have

137
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,060
different implications based on the

138
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,320
current states

139
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,900
it helps the DSA to handle exceptions

140
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,320
for example detecting a non-owner in a

141
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,860
normal State implies unauthorized excess

142
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,259
also it can help correct the false

143
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,419
positives of sharing gesture detection

144
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,139
that falsely enables the sharing state

145
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,660
So based on the more you mentioned in

146
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,940
the previous slides we implemented a

147
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,120
prototype DSA service on Android it is

148
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,020
running in the background to

149
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,880
continuously detect the sharing events

150
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,460
and once the DSA enters the sharing

151
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,740
state it will it will enable the app

152
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,319
level access control and hide the

153
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
notifications for assistive apps at the

154
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,539
same time it can also interact with the

155
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,060
other apps like notifying the current

156
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,060
foreground app of the sharing events and

157
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,180
for example so this Gallery app can just

158
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,280
receive this signal to disable the

159
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,979
sensitive operations like deleting or

160
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,800
modifying a photo during a sharing event

161
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,639
yeah

162
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
to evaluate the effectiveness of DSA we

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
conducted a user study with two parts

164
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,740
the first part focuses on the

165
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,800
performance of Handover detection we

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,199
collected both Handover and non-handover

167
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,020
data from 18 participants and five

168
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,960
different film models we measure the

169
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,759
Precision and recoveries of the Cross

170
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,340
user cross-device models under different

171
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,840
settings

172
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,360
in the second part we tested how well

173
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,180
DSA handled a complete device sharing

174
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,060
events we used a pre-trained Handover

175
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,400
detection model and a double the touch

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
base I for owner detection

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,500
can participants perform the web page

178
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,139
and sharing tasks in pairs and

179
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,979
contributed to 50 sessions in total

180
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,860
here are the results of our study for

181
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,539
the first part we should hand over

182
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,419
detection results in terms of the

183
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,819
Precision record and reference score we

184
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,280
investigated the impact of a segment

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,699
size interval Windows size as well as

186
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,220
the activation threshold for adaptive

187
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,380
sensing

188
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,599
and eventually we obtain the best

189
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,220
settings that achieve a balanced

190
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,280
precision and recoveries

191
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,500
assuming the Box the overall Precision

192
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,900
is about 98 and the recovery is about 95

193
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,460
the average detection time was about

194
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,639
2.33 seconds after the owner starts to

195
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,400
hand the device and it shows that and

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,740
DSA could enable the sharing mode right

197
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,060
after a Sherry took the device

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
in the second part we recorded the

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,340
traces of DSA handling the sharing

200
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,039
events and this figure shows one sample

201
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,520
Trace and we can see see that the owner

202
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
was initially using the device which can

203
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,458
be reflected by the owner detection

204
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,279
and after DSA detect our hand over

205
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,799
gesture the system enabled the sharing

206
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,100
mode and while the Sherry was browsing

207
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,680
the web page the only detection kept

208
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,740
track of the user's identity and only

209
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,660
after the owner's identity had been

210
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,880
verified the system moved back to the

211
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,140
normal state

212
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,959
so in total DSA automatically and

213
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,480
successfully handled 41 sessions without

214
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,200
any exceptions and in the rest sessions

215
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,940
DSA can correct seven of them with the

216
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,459
help of owner detection

217
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,519
foreign

218
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,839
I would like to quickly summarize our

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
work so in this paper we propose the

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,620
division awareness DSA and provided

221
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,060
implementation on Android

222
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,860
and our user studies should the

223
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,959
effectiveness of the DSA in handling and

224
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,360
sharing events and we also release our

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,180
data and source code of DSA as a link

226
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,720
shown on the slides for future work we

227
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,220
would like to extend the sharing gesture

228
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,860
detection to cover more edge cases and

229
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,140
also we would like to conduct a

230
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,300
long-term user study to collab more

231
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,120
users feedback okay so this is the end

232
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,800
of the presentation I'll be happy to

233
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,360
answer your questions thank you for

234
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,720
listening
