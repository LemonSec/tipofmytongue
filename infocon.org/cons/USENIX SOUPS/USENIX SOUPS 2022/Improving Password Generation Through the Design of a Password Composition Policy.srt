1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,219
I'm Anuj and I'm going to be talking

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,840
about password improving password

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,520
generation so password managers

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,580
help users Generate random passwords

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,800
strong passwords which help them secure

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,080
against guessing attacks

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,880
but a priority research has shown that

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,439
users tend to underutilize the

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,260
generation aspect of password managers

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,020
these prior works are our primary

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,120
motivation especially each at all in

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
which we do observational interviews

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,500
with password manager usual users and we

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,440
see that usability issues with generated

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,020
passwords can lead to users avoiding

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,579
generating passwords using password

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,500
managers altogether

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,620
one of those usability issues is that

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,260
the websites have weird composition

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,320
policies that reject all the generated

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,840
passwords by password managers so how do

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,659
we improve the experience for the user

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,020
the solution we come up with is a PCB

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,659
description language with two goals in

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,420
mind it should be able to describe the

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,240
pcps that we find online Second would be

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,700
it should be easy to read and write so

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,680
it's not a hassle of its own to manage

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,159
for our first goal We Gather PCP

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,299
geographically diverse pcbs online

32
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,299
we collect one from at least a country

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,020
from every continent every six continent

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,140
and then we add countries with high

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,460
levels of Internet censorship on it

36
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,100
All In All We gathered in websites from

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,979
Alexa top sources and quancast

38
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,399
we end up with 626 unique websites from

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,380
all the countries after all the

40
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,140
deduplication removing websites that do

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,360
not have accounts that rely solely on

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,180
ssos and which required different

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,758
materials such as bank accounts and

44
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,180
identification numbers or have the same

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,060
package such as Google and YouTube we

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,340
end up with 270 unique websites

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,620
so using those unique websites we build

48
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,440
a description language we started with a

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,620
simple json-based base language and then

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,680
we iteratively encode all of the 270

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,300
unique pcps

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,660
uh if if there's one of the pcbs that's

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,360
difficult to encode we add features to

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,340
our language so that all of them are

55
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,099
easy to encode once we are happy with

56
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,080
the language that that we built we

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,700
solicit some feedbacks from our

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,300
colleagues to further strengthen it so

59
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,640
let's we end up with a PCB description

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,000
language which has these features it

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,519
supports custom character sets it

62
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,099
supports minimum maximum and consecutive

63
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,019
character lens for the whole passwords

64
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,800
or different character sets it supports

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,920
required category sets or n subsets such

66
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,519
as one of digits or symbols

67
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,019
it supports required and prohibitive

68
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,300
locations such as a password cannot end

69
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,580
with this symbol

70
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,000
and something that's novel to our PCB

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,220
language and as opposed to other ones

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,060
there that were out there is it suppose

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,099
multiple sets of rules

74
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,200
so let's look at some examples this is

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,480
this one's from facebook.com which is

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,540
six characters long digits alphabets and

77
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,220
symbols

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,980
this one's from BBC which is 8 to 50

79
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,440
characters alphabets and then digits are

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,879
symbols

81
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,239
this one's from GitHub which is either a

82
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,000
short complex password or a 15 character

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
or long simple password

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
so with our PCB description language at

85
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,420
hand we'll look into some of the uses

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,640
that it has the first and the most

87
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
obvious one is password checking we

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
develop libraries in Python and

89
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,659
JavaScript and put it online on pipei

90
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,199
and npm administrators can define a PCP

91
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,139
once and can use our libraries on boot

92
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,660
server and client-side to validate their

93
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,100
passwords

94
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,400
second we generating passwords we

95
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
Implement a proof of concept on bit

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,380
Warden that fetches the PCB that has

97
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,960
been deployed on the website and then

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
generate passwords which is compliant to

99
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,740
the PCB

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,400
and thirdly we use the PCP itself to

101
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,979
calculate the search space as its

102
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,280
strength and that can be used to check

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,100
if PCP is strong enough before deploying

104
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,360
it

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
something novel about our PCB strength

106
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,000
checking algorithm is we

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,240
have found out that humans aren't a

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,759
password generator so they do not create

109
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,400
random passwords humans have preferences

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,040
previous research has shown that Chinese

111
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,880
users prefer numeric characters U.S

112
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,759
users prefer alphabetic characters

113
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,160
and these preferences impacts the

114
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,620
strength of password built on a PCB

115
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,199
separately our PCB strength algorithm

116
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,419
takes that into account and calculates

117
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,240
the actual strength using human

118
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,419
preference in mind

119
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,720
we we evaluate our language and tooling

120
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,180
using a user study in which participants

121
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,340
include five pcps of increasing

122
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,840
difficulty

123
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,100
are

124
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,860
metrics of success are correctness

125
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,100
completion time and perceived usability

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,380
the demographics where University

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,020
students 52 percent of them graduate

128
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,139
students 76 percent male and 92 percent

129
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,840
computer science students we use

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,080
students as an actin for software

131
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,660
Engineers as they'll be entering the

132
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,639
workforce or shortly and they'll be the

133
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,400
ones managing the authentication code in

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,500
a year or so from now

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,419
so the results of our usability study is

136
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,960
apart from policy five and apart from

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,060
two users who got almost everything

138
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,419
wrong

139
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,020
the results are almost perfect there

140
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,960
the time required is 30 seconds to four

141
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,560
and a half minutes so not so much for

142
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,300
users some of whom did not even know

143
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,940
what a Json was when they started

144
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,720
and even for policy five the errors were

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,199
from Json formatting errors such as

146
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,539
before getting too close a bracket or

147
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,560
minor errors such as forgetting to

148
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,919
exclude a period or comma from the PCB

149
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,500
so

150
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,720
now using our strength checking

151
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,380
algorithm we analyze our web pcps we

152
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,840
take works from Florencia and Myers

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,539
published in soups previously and

154
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,500
analyze our PCB data set using our

155
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,240
algorithms and we try to compare it with

156
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,880
the previous efforts the improvements of

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,220
our methods on those

158
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,620
those methods are we have a larger data

159
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,039
set with 270 unique websites we have a

160
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,259
greater Geographic diversity The Works

161
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,680
only focused on U.S and Germany and we

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,960
have a more precise strength of a

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,479
strength estimate for pcbs as it takes

164
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,080
into accounts all the composition

165
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,759
composition

166
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,680
stuff and also the human preference as

167
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,639
well

168
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,720
so uh let's look at some of the results

169
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,620
here results are kind of surprising if

170
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,680
we look at if we look at Chinese users

171
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
who prefer numeric characters as we as

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
I've been seeing in the previous

173
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,340
research we see that

174
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,500
half of the passwords are not even

175
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,759
secure against online attacks which is

176
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,860
dangerous at least

177
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,160
and looking at use U.S users also like

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,900
almost all of the passwords are not

179
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,660
secure against offline attacks and even

180
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,580
if you use a password manager and you

181
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,139
come generate completely random

182
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,419
passwords that are just enough for the

183
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,460
pcbs half of them are not secure against

184
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,479
offline attacks

185
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,059
we also see a correlation between

186
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,039
strength and the popularity of the

187
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,219
website so the more popular website is

188
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,279
more stronger the pcpe tend to be

189
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,559
comparing with nist recommendations we

190
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,680
see that 40 percent have a minimum

191
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
length of at least eight

192
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,459
less than 30 percent have no maximum

193
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,220
length restrictions uh

194
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,040
65 percent have no character composition

195
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,220
requirements which is good but if paired

196
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,800
with a minimum length a good enough

197
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,540
minimum length but that was not the case

198
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,680
for the pcbs that we had so

199
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,820
pcbs that did not have composition

200
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,940
requirement had a sub optimal minimum

201
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,620
lens requirement as well

202
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,740
so comparing with the prior analysis we

203
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,820
see that PCB have grown over time but

204
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,839
it's just not enough the pcbs are still

205
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,080
not passwords generated under pcbs are

206
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,700
still not resilient against offline

207
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
attacks

208
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,459
most of the pcbs still exist in those

209
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,700
offline online chasm

210
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,920
there's a correlation between PCP and

211
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,320
the PCB strength and the popularity of

212
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,839
the website and like past research

213
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,880
different features such as ads and

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,560
public usernames do not have any

215
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
correlation between with the strength of

216
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,480
the PCB with that I'd love to take

217
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,720
questions
