00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,519
hi my name is Akira from kbda research I

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,980
present on recruiting and retaining

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,599
users for security sensitive

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,300
longitudinal measurement and panels This

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,939
block was done by called estate authors

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,260
from kddi and Carnegie Meadow University

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,720
in human Factory security research many

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,300
studies attempt to characterize human

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,020
behavior on Computing devices under

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,960
realistic conditions however due to the

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,899
limitation of user survey research

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,360
utilize this measurement panel approach

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,760
where participant devices are

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,579
instrumented in their behavior monitored

15
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,039
by researchers the central problem of

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,440
Benjamin panel is the highly intrusive

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,860
nature as usual every day on Computing

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,500
devices device measurements becoming

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,379
more and more privacy basic this require

20
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,140
that massager have to explain the

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,479
security and privacy risk to the

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,720
potential participants that in

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
presenting this kind of risk information

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,580
show user may be deducted to join the

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,580
subway this leads to the challenges in

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,200
conducting security sensitive

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,780
longitudinal and German panels the

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,820
research score of this paper is to

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,220
synthesize recommendation for recruiting

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,380
and detaining participants for future

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,619
privacy invasive content studies we

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,740
selected three case studies for this

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,439
goal because we were involved in the

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,900
design conducting analysis of the

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,840
research we had a direct access to the

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,640
data participants and the other

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
researchers the table shows the three

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,700
case studies their recent long-scale

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,880
longitudinal panels featuring 2 million

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,860
2 and 600 users and running for period

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,640
ranging from 2 to over 5 years and

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,780
conducted in Japan and the United States

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,699
targeting personal computers and mobile

44
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,000
devices recruiting three case study

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
utilized very different recruiting and

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
retaining approaches for instance one

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,220
study utilize monetary incentives to

48
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,879
recruit users while another adapt a

49
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,879
popular animation character and the

50
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,459
third study provide additional security

51
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,680
functionality

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
in case of SPO participants were

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,860
recruited in physical area using

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,220
University Research recruiting service

55
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,879
as the primary source individual you see

56
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
30 dollars upon enrollment and 10

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,319
dollars for each month

58
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,800
in case of mfbo since the application is

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,180
free to download from Google Play Store

60
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,319
it adapts a famous animation character

61
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,720
user can show the character icon on

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,060
Android smartphone home screen the

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,420
security server is used as part of a

64
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,720
specific web service Primary in Japan

65
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,840
the Web Service Partners distribute the

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,500
turbo on the home security company as

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,159
part of their services the mspo app

68
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,400
consists of a cartoon character agent on

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,220
the smartphone's home screen and a chat

70
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,099
type interface the animation character

71
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,519
appears not just in the home screen but

72
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,459
in any application tapping on the

73
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,940
character icon launches the apps and

74
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,459
bring the user to the chat type

75
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,400
interface the application is free to

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,819
download from Google Play Store

77
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,459
comparing SPO and mspo they are

78
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,340
different in incentive design so both

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,220
samples are skewed in comparison to the

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,620
general population most notably

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,220
participant in the mspl study has lower

82
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,040
income than U.S population in addition

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
we observe a buy model age distribution

84
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,120
skewed towards under 30 and over 60 this

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
may be related to the income skew of the

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,940
two largest subgroups consists of

87
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,020
University students and retirees and FBO

88
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,080
sample also is strongly skilled towards

89
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,440
Men We hypothesize this is because the

90
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,960
Sci-Fi animation character is targeting

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
towards younger adult men comparing SPO

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,520
and mspo two-thirds of SPO participants

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,040
reported have been used at least one

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,060
crowd walking or survey platform 23

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,960
percent of FBO users have signed up for

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,259
other studies at least once a month on

97
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,860
the other hand 10 percent of msbo users

98
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,620
have used crowd working services or

99
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,919
other survey platforms and only five

100
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,759
percent signed it up in the last year we

101
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
asked important factors when

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,120
participating Assad SPO used reported

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,300
how much paid an amount of work are most

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,240
important and SBO users are interested

105
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
in research purpose and privacy instead

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,060
we compare the security behaviors by

107
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,479
using security measurement score

108
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,720
CBS and its device version all series

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
and in our series

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,740
comparing security Behavior users of

111
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,160
mfpo is the highest score and SPO is the

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,520
second as a reference of PC users we

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,940
listed CB score conducted in Japan for

114
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,880
PC users the difference in distribution

115
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,940
of scores between these studies was

116
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,960
statistically significant at the 95

117
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,020
percent confidence interval monitoring

118
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,680
inference we hypothesized that users

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,500
change their behavior during the first

120
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,800
few weeks in the study users may be

121
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
aware that the device was being

122
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,220
monitored

123
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,880
however we did not find any differences

124
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,819
in the behavior during the period just

125
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,639
after recruitment the figure solves the

126
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,620
number of days participants were in

127
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,199
study and the average application used

128
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,160
and so on the figure shows device used

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,680
to remain constant regardless of the

130
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,419
length of the time we also observed that

131
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,220

132
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,940
website from zero day retaining between

133
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,580
the three studies we observed big

134
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,800
difference in the retention rate the

135
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,259
graph showed a couple of Maya survival

136

137
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,000
probability of a user remaining in a

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,880
study of the the number of days has

139
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,360
shown the survival curve for FBO is

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
vegetable linear with half of the

141
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Pakistan dropping out after about 700

142
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,380
days in the study mspo on the other hand

143
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,400
having high initial drop out rate it is

144
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
60 percent of participants over the

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,240
first months after stabilization

146
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,220
participants drop rate is similar or

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,639
slightly steeper as in the SPO the first

152
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,720
to the initial rollout that we could not

similarly around the main complaints

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,979
from participants in FBO was the sensor

158
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,620
software slow down user's device the

159
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,780
second factor is minimizing interference

160
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,900
the initial version of mfpo app

161
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,419
continuously display the character icon

162
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,960
not only the home screen but also when

163
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,139
using the other apps this was designed

164
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,900
to remind the user of the application in

165
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,900
monetary however we received feedback

166
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,020
that this feature severely interfere

167
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,599
with users activities the third

168
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,360
important retention factor is the right

169
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,099
balance of communication with

170
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,339
participants in the nsbo study we

171
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,860
hypothesized that radio notification

172
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,339
would increase user's engagement we send

173
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,080
users 3 notification per week however it

174
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,380
becomes clear that user found this level

175
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,440
of communication is too high we turned

176
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,339
off this and made them optional in SBO

177
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,040
study new participants receive an

178
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,620
initial enrollment phone call from the

179
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,740
results pin then they receive additional

180
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,380
phone calls whenever they have stopped

181
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,019
sending the data this group maintain

182
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,600
users during the early phase of the

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,980
study I list recommendation and findings

184
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,080
synthesized by the paper here thank you

185
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
