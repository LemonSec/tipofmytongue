2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,700
student at the University of Tokyo today

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,520
I will present our work deal check on

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
behalf of my co-hosters this is my

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,619
undergraduate statistics work as well

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,580
I'm very happy to present the workshew

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,920
nowadays I'm learning about internet

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
security and ethics is critical for

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,079
everyone but not so many people have

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,480
enough opportunities to learning them

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,899
for example an agency in Japan reported

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,320
that only 17.9 percent of smart device

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,559
users had experienced uh Online safety

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,780
training the lack of knowledge and

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,460
awareness can lead to Serious internet

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,000
hazards however conventional learning

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,300
style like Iranian often affordable only

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,899
for students or office workers and there

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,699
are the cases that they can not only

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,640
once a year it is necessary to land

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,299
regularly because the knowledge decays

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,580
as the time goes and the threats are

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,580
more and more sophisticated nowadays

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,000
so we propose diochic and interactive

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,180
micro running system for Online safety

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,299
our idea is integrating Online safety

27
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,400
micro running into human verification

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,920
tasks like capture

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,560
micro running is a learning style that

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,080
Learners can split learning tasks into

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,659
smaller particles and Runners can run

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,640
them in the spare time

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,159
micro running has been often focused on

34
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,920
in HDR fields for many for vocabulary

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,740
development and our work extend the

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,100
scope to human Online safety micro

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,840
running

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,020
and we saw capture as suitable for micro

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,899
running platform because many internet

40
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,960
users encounters captures often when

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
they internet browsers

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,840
and conventional capture like recapture

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,038
demands used to undo tasks and we

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,879
propose that and to propose a question

45
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,060
of Online safety and ethics instead of

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,900
conventional captures tasks

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,120
and this is the design of the Dual check

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,040
asks user to respond to a question of

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,700
Online safety and user can learn them by

50
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,280
answering the question and reading the

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,900
explanations

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
and at the same time do you check

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,700
performs human verification tasks based

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,400
on users Castle Behavior like recapture

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
V2

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,720
it is important to note that this human

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,420
verification process does not depend on

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,400
whether the user answered correctly to

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,660
the question

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,360
in this system the running process and

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,160
the human verification process works

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,940
simultaneously but separatedly

63
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,420
and we implemented a prototype or that

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,280
works in a web browsers

65
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,760
the current our product does not have an

66
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
actual human verification function

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,140
because the code of blue captured was

68
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,260
not available and our main purpose is to

69
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,019
investigate the learning effect of dual

70
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,819
check

71
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,580
this is a demonstration of the Dual

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,599
check

73
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,360
due chick is embedded in the web survey

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,659
and the user is answering to the survey

75
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,180
and then they have to answer to the

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
question from Dual check this is the

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,739
multiple choice question and the user

78
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,799
Choice One statement

79
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,940
then the cursor rotates and then

80
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,299
shows answers and

81
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,519
explanations and the user is ex reading

82
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,080
the explanations

83
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,900
then the submit to button appears and

84
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,580
the user can finish the survey

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,980
we next prepared 10 questions about

86
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,099
Online safety to use in dual check

87
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,040
and we thought that it is important that

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
the question should neither too

89
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,340
difficult not too easy so that many

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,440
users can learn manifold things from

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,699
geologic

92
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,699
we collected hot issues from some

93
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,060
materials and made 25 questions

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,620
then we conducted the

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,720
crowdsourcing-based study to verify the

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,240
difficulty of questions

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,300
finally we chose 10 questions and that

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,000
have under 80 percent of correct answer

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,220
rates

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,259
to verify the landing effect and the

101
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,259
usability of dual check we conducted a

102
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,720
15-day use the study

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,300
we set the task design to be a practical

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,020
situation of geologic usage

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,720
we next and set two modes for the logic

106
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,960
the first mode we that we call runtime

107
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,900
mode allows user to go next even the

108
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,300
answer is wrong to the questions

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,880
and the second mode that we call repeat

110
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,720
mode demands used to answer repeatedly

111
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,360
to the same question until they reach

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
the correct answer

113
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,680
and we then recruited 34 participants

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,900
from

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,520
crowdsourcing platform and randomly

116
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,300
split them to two groups for based on

117
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,900
one-time mode uses and repeat mode users

118
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,960
on the first day of the deployment study

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,180
we asked participants to answer 10

120
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,160
questions that we made in our quiz

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,620
creation process about Online safety and

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,880
ethics

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
next during the deployment study we

124
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,520
asked participants to answer to a

125
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,460
questionnaire and then respond to a dual

126
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,979
check question three times each day

127
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,320
at this time do chick proposed one

128
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,660
question and that circulated from the

129
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,820
quiz set

130
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,360
on the final day of the department study

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,120
we asked participants to answer 10

132
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,740
questions again

133
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,100
and in addition we made another 10

134
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
question set that are similar to the

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,800
original question States and also ask

136
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,000
them to solve them

137
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,720
then we verify the landing effect of

138
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,100
geologic first we focused on correct

139
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,620
answer rate which I will call accuracy

140
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,520
of that mean accuracy of the incorrect

141
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,060
answer and focus on the trend of mean

142
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
accuracy

143
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,319
first we conducted two-way maneuver to

144
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,259
verify the learning effect and compare

145
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,740
the most of tumors and the one-time mode

146
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,180
and repeat mode

147
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,199
so and for the mean accuracy me accuracy

148
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,780
wrote significantly after the deployment

149
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,860
study

150
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,259
however there were no significant

151
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,120
difference between one-time mode users

152
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,180
and repeat mode uses

153
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,259
we then inside it more deep free on the

154
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,900
each question accuracy

155
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,000
and the original Christians nine

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,100
questions shows shiny country higher

157
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,940
accuracy in day 15 than first day

158
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,460
and for the similar questions that we

159
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,819
asked only 15th day and five questions

160
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,099
should see each country higher accuracy

161
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,199
than General user accuracy

162
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,300
we then analyze the usability of

163
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,500
geologic

164
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,919
we collected an Asus score of the object

165
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,500
from participants and compare them to

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,440
another captures and the object score

167
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,199
was significantly higher than that of

168
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,560
text-based and picture-based capture the

169
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,419
school was lower than that object both

170
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,520
space capture but there is no

171
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,080
significant difference between them

172
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,319
we also corrected a free phone comments

173
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,380
from participants and participants gave

174
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,319
us positive comments and important

175
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,319
feedbacks for improving capture and dual

176
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,560
check

177
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,660
while our deployment studies shows and

178
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,900
positive aspects of dual check there

179
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,639
still be a

180
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,900
limitations in our study for example we

181
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,759
collected participants from

182
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,919
crowdsourcing platform

183
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,960
so the participants might be more

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,260
accustomed to the internet technology

185
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,539
because they often use internet for

186
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,399
their work

187
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,520
and for future work an investigation of

188
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,620
other topics or formats of questions

189
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,680
will be important for enhance the

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,440
potential of a deal check

191
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,440
and thinking more practical aspects of

192
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,779
dealership is also important

193
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,839
for example it is necessary to maintain

194
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,300
and update all the questions because

195
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,580
that

196
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,980
threat and attacks and even more and

197
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,720
more sophisticated nowadays

198
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,940
in conclusion our deployment study

199
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,980
confirmed the positive learning effect

200
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,680
and how you perceive usability of

201
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,060
geologic

202
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,000
so we conclude that do check would help

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,220
internet users learning about Online

204
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,180
safety and ethics in their daily lives

205
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,640
this is a summary of the presentation

206
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,660
thank you for listening
