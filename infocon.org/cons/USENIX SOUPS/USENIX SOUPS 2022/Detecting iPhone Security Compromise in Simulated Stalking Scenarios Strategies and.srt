1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,000
my name is Hansel Kim and the study was

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,280
done along with fellow students and de

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,160
Gallardo here in tianingly and advised

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,140
by professors Laurie Crainer and Luol

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,900
Bauer at Carnegie Mellon University

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,320
our study explored the usability of iOS

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,900
and other features when trying to detect

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,359
iPhone security compromises in context

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,159
of stalking and intimate partner

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,100
violence so this talk we'll discuss some

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
problems about stalking and intimate

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
partner violence so if you need to step

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,219
away this may be a good time to do so

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,640
globally about one in three women

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,820
between the ages of 15 to 49 who have

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,920
ever been in a romantic relationship

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,140
experienced intimate partner violence

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,960
which we will refer to as ipv

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,940
though this problem is also experienced

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,680
by non-women

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,960
digital Technologies are increasingly

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,540
being used to spy on stock and harass

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,420
intimate partners and stalking victims

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,000
and what makes this problem worse are

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
spoilers and stalking stalker wear apps

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,340
there are profitable Global markets for

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,860
these kinds of softwares and here is an

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,520
example of Apple App Store review for

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,799
our popular stock aware app the review

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,860
on the left says the app did a great job

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,680
giving them on access to their husbands

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,780
from and review on the right mentions

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,240
that downloading the app onto their wise

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,820
phone and also complains about the cost

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,360
this is an example of an app explicitly

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,000
marketed and being used for to spy on

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,900
intimate partners but legitimate apps

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,420
such as Google Maps or actual device

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,939
features like Cloud syncing can also be

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,860
used for stalking

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,320
our study considers a threat model in

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,540
which an attacker or abuser does not

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,479
require technical sophistication but

45
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,340
rather take some advantage of physical

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,979
access to the device to things like

47
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,560
enabling location sharing downloading

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,500
apps that may transmit data back to them

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,379
we also consider attackers or abusers

50
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,140
who may know enough about the victim to

51
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,660
guess passwords or security answers to

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,300
gain access to an account like iCloud or

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,239
Google as well as consensual or coercive

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,400
situations where couples may share their

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,300
passwords and access

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,940
since we wanted to test the usability of

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,940
our current iOS and app interfaces in

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,640
the context of stocking and ipv we

59
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,160
focused on the ability of victim support

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
networks such as friends families or

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,599
co-workers to detect and resolve

62
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,760
security compromises in these four

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,099
listed simulated stalking scenarios

64
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,599
location sharing suspected spyware

65
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,340
iCloud compromise and jailbreak

66
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,379
detection

67
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,780
we conducted 18

68
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,180
a semi-structured interviews with

69
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,280
participants who acted as friends or

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,800
co-workers to a hypothetical stalking

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
victim we did not recruit victims of ipv

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,459
or stalking to avoid any

73
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,080
re-traumatization since the question of

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,480
usability can be explored with general

75
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,280
population users

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,739
we'll only have time to tell you about

77
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,959
scenario one and three today but rest

78
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,800
are in the paper

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,959
for scenario one we asked participants

80
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,940
to guide us through how they would

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,920
confirm whether someone is tracking

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,860
their co-workers location we set up the

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,319
test devices location to be shared with

84
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,599
on imaginary character Mallory as it's

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,360
shown in the screenshot

86
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,000
most participants knew to look into

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,459
location services to find out that

88
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,440
Google Maps was using the device's

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,080
location for those who didn't we gave

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,420
them hints leading them to the iPhone's

91
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,120
location services showing them that the

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,459
locations were always enabled for Google

93
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,379
Maps as it's shown in the left

94
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,959
screenshot

95
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,000
however none of the participants

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,220
searched within the Google Maps app and

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,320
we had to guide every participant to

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,399
actually open the app

99
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,199
participants expressed frustration with

100
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,180
the process to get to the location

101
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,580
sharing option within the Google Maps

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,820
app from IOS location services one

103
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,680
participant said it was just too much

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
jumping around

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,639
another said it was tricky to go into

106
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,740
the app setting not just iPhone settings

107
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,500
so they had a bit of issue to find it

108
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
even though it was all there

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,540
most of our 18 participants found it

110
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,880
easy to disable sharing once they found

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,340
the right setting in the app now I'll

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,020
hand it off to Andy who will discuss

113
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,159
about scenario three

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,979
thank you Hansel

115
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,199
so in scenario three we told

116
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,000
participants that some of their friends

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
photos and iMessages were disappearing

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,960
and that new ones their friend didn't

119
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,520
recognize were appearing in the iPhone

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,979
when we asked them what steps they would

121
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,540
take to figure out whether someone else

122
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,979
could see their friends photos and

123
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,860
messages 12 of 18 participants looked at

124
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,960
the iOS photo settings searching for

125
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,180
things like shared albums as shown on

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,340
the left and some also looked at the

127
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,320
messages settings shown on the right

128
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,300
yet there were no indicators here that

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,979
could confirm whether another person had

130
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,080
access to the data

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,539
we gave

132
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,780
11 of 18 participants the hint that this

133
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,000
was occurring because of device syncing

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,039
and nudge seven of those towards the

135
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,139
iCloud settings within the main iOS

136
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,240
settings to see if they could locate the

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
list of devices that were logged into

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
the iCloud account

139
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,520
most participants were familiar with the

140
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,259
concept of iCloud and the iOS settings

141
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,479
user interface but half of them had

142
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,340
difficulty actually locating that list

143
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,259
of devices in the Apple ID settings

144
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,419
which would reveal that an unknown

145
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,520
device was locked into the account

146
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,860
many participants went to this initial

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,900
settings screen selected the Apple ID

148
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,300
where it says Bob boberson

149
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,460
and then once they reached the Apple ID

150
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,560
settings they continued to search

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,539
selecting options on the screen such as

152
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,940
password and security name phone numbers

153
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,819
email Family Sharing and iCloud

154
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,100
eventually we need to take them back to

155
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,960
this Apple ID settings screen where as

156
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,580
some of you may have noticed at the very

157
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,440
bottom of the screen is the list of

158
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
devices

159
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,560
one problem here might have been that

160
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
the unknown device shown on the right

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,340
here and named ABC was not immediately

162
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,340
visible when participant said I think I

163
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,380
knew generally to look under iCloud but

164
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,960
I just didn't know the full screen

165
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,180
once they found the list of devices and

166
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,860
saw the unknown device logged into the

167
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,900
iCloud account most participants found

168
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,940
it easy to select and then remove the

169
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,039
device given the option that says remove

170
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,960
from account in Red Letters shown here

171
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
on the right

172
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,199
thus for both scenario one location

173
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,539
sharing and scenario three iCloud

174
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,880
compromise most of our 18 participants

175
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,280
did not find it intuitive to locate the

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,319
options that would inform them about a

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,639
remote user with access to their

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,340
friend's data yet once they were shown

179
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,020
the options they found it easy to remove

180
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,240
access so

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,340
what can be done about these usability

182
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,919
issues for the sake of brevity we will

183
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,539
highlight our recommendations for just

184
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,280
these two scenarios

185
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,099
first regarding location sharing we

186
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,660
recommend that companies provide users

187
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,240
with persistent visible indicators that

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,220
their location data is being transmitted

189
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
to other users

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,000
indeed while Google's developer policy

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,979
bans stalkerware which it defines as

192
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,139
quote code that collects and or

193
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,180
transmits personal or sensitive user

194
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,400
data from a device without adequate

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,560
notice or consent and doesn't display a

196
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
persistent notification that this is

197
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
happening and quote navigation apps such

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,060
as Google Maps Waze and find my also do

199
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,680
not provide persistent notifications

200
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
that location data is being transmitted

201
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,120
to another user showing a concerning

202
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,919
overlap with Google's own stalkerware

203
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,120
definition

204
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,340
to improve transparency an indicator

205
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,620
could alert users to the fact that they

206
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,819
are currently sharing their location

207
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,039
with another user not just using

208
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,759
location services

209
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,780
we also recommend that companies

210
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,759
generate less predictable periodic

211
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,979
notifications so that an abuser cannot

212
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,660
regularly check and delete such

213
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,120
notifications as well as provide an

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,759
option to require authentication in

215
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,259
order to start sharing location with

216
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,240
another person since there is currently

217
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,320
no such option available

218
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,940
and regarding iCloud account compromise

219
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,979
we recommend that apple add indicators

220
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,958
in app settings to inform users about

221
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
devices accessing their iCloud account

222
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,700
and perhaps making changes in those apps

223
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,380
additionally we recommend that Apple

224
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,899
make finding logged in devices Easier by

225
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,580
making the list of devices more

226
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,160
immediately visible since it is located

227
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
at the bottom of the Apple ID options

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,000
screen without being itself a searchable

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
option

230
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,660
to wrap things up we'll leave you with a

231
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,820
few takeaways participants found it

232
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,440
difficult to detect when an iPhone was

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,820
transmitting their data to another

234
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,220
remote user primarily due to two

235
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,800
underlying factors the inability to

236
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,899
locate relevant options and the lack of

237
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,120
immediately visible indicators of data

238
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,200
transmission

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
our work highlights the need to consider

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,040
the threat model of stalking and ipv

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,740
when designing user interfaces which

242
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,320
will not only make victims safer by

243
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
minimizing the threat call model but

244
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,860
will also make interfaces more usable

245
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,779
for anyone concerned about their privacy

246
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,279
or security thank you
