1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:13,518
welcome to the last talk

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,920
um so smart home devices affect the

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,500
privacy of everyone who encounters them

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,140
not just the primary users who choose to

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,180
buy and install them but also other

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,820
people who live or work in the household

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,400
as well as visitors and bystanders and

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,019
yes you have seen this clip art before

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,759
this session

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,680
it's an attractor

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,579
um

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,160
so how much control secondary or

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
incidental users or bystanders have over

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,500
what data devices collect over them

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,960
about them depends on their relationship

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,899
with the primary users

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,079
our research focused on employer

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
employee relationships in Smart Homes

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,520
specifically the case of nannies we

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,460
wanted to examine how the inherent power

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,100
imbalances in that relationship affect

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,220
privacy perspectives and outcomes

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,860
and among smart home devices we focused

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,200
on cameras because employers can more

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,080
readily use them to surveil the nanny

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,880
and thus affect their job satisfaction

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,899
and job security

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,420
I research questions were how are

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,880
nannies privacy attitudes experiences

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,520
expectations concerns and choices with

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,340
regard to working with smart smart home

33
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,200
cameras shaped by their relationships

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,020
with their employers how do employers

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,200
use of cameras their interactions with

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
employees about cameras reflect

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,759
reinforce or change the power dynamics

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,159
in those relationships

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,079
um and we also wanted to identify any

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,820
potential points of intervention for

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,619
mitigating the effects of power

42
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,960
imbalances and providing means for

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,540
nannies to enact their privacy

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,979
preferences

45
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,600
and to answer those questions we

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,479
conducted 25 semi-structured qualitative

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
interviews with nannies Au Pairs and

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,040
professional babysitters

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
most most of them had had Direct

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,899
experience working with smart home

51
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,220
cameras

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,860
we used a thematic analysis approach to

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,860
analyze the data we began by inductively

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,480
coding the transcripts with a

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,940
collaboratively developed code book then

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,980
we reviewed coded excerpts to isolate

57
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,420
the themes relevant to our research

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,739
questions

59
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,560
moving on to our findings participants

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
our participants had a wide range of

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
privacy attitudes towards cameras and

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
homes where they worked at a high level

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,440
they explained those attitudes in terms

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
of factors like the purpose of data

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,220
collection are the cameras there to

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,980
supervise or surveil the nannies or is

67
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,140
the nanny an incidental bystander to a

68
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,220
camera that's there for some other

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,300
reason

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,280
and especially if the cameras were used

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
for supervision their attitudes also

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,239
depended on how they were they thought

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,860
the cameras and the data would be used

74
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,379
like what positive or negative impacts

75
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,060
they might have on the nanny's

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,720
day-to-day experience on the job

77
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,400
um and participants contextualize those

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,920
views in terms of how the purposes and

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,019
uses might reflect or affect their

80
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,280
relationships with their employers

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,120
for example some participants viewed

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,239
camera use and whether cameras were

83
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,819
disclosed as an indicator of employers

84
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,459
attitudes toward the nannies affecting

85
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,459
those relationship Dynamics

86
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,140
many participants became concerned about

87
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,060
trust if they saw that employers had

88
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,980
cameras everywhere in the house or

89
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,620
seemed to be constantly watching them

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,780
um for instance today 14 said if they

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,060
felt the need to monitor me 40 24 7 I

92
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,379
would be uncomfortable with that because

93
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,560
that shows the level of distrust

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,060
and some participants even viewed it as

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,159
a signal of distrust if their employers

96
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,840
had cameras at all so again there's a

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,140
range

98
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,019
in particular many participants viewed

99
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,599
not disclosing cameras in the house as a

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,940
potential sign of distrust in many

101
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,819
equated non-disclosure with disrespect

102
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,920
for example on any 10 I said I had no

103
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,299
problem being recorded as long as you're

104
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,739
telling me you're doing it it's

105
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,659
respecting me enough to respecting you

106
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,060
enough to let you know

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,720
um

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,299
conversely many participants pointed out

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,978
that disclosure can be a way to build

110
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,560
Mutual trust and alleviate privacy

111
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,260
concerns by reassuring cameras that the

112
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
cameras were sorry reassuring nannies

113
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,720
that the cameras will be used

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,040
respectfully so like 97 said there needs

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,419
to be two-way communication so that I

116
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,979
feel trust

117
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,720
participants also mentioned that they

118
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,280
would like to discuss some specific

119
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,520
details about use and data handling like

120
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
how often the cameras were checked

121
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,880
because knowing more about what was

122
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,560
happening would make them feel more

123
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
comfortable

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,680
um though a couple of participants were

125
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,060
concerned that knowing certain details

126
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,699
might make them self-conscious

127
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,860
in addition to how cameras could reflect

128
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,500
employer employee relationships many

129
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,940
participants explained that their

130
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,979
privacy attitudes depended on how

131
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,780
cameras could affect those relationships

132
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,139
and both positive and negative ways some

133
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,240
participants had concerns about how

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,340
cameras could reinforce undesirable

135
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,740
Dynamics in an employer employee

136
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,199
relations for example many were

137
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,940
concerned about how having cameras might

138
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,220
encourage intrusive supervision or

139
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,780
micromanagement

140
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,900
Mr so nanny 37 said if purpose is to

141
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,280
babysit me while I'm nannying the

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,539
children that I feel really

143
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,460
uncomfortable with that

144
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,039
cameras can also allow an employer to

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
find an excuse to reprimand or fire the

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,060
nanny in bad faith

147
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,160
um some Manny some nannies viewed it as

148
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,919
spying if their employers watch them

149
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,539
constantly on the camera especially when

150
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,039
they work with the children like at nap

151
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,020
time

152
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,160
others of you being watched at all as

153
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,380
spying hence the scare quotes different

154
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,060
participants use that term spying

155
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,800
differently

156
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,900
um for example Nanny 26

157
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,820
said if they were watching then I was me

158
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,680
when I wasn't even with the child I

159
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,060
probably would leave the job I just

160
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,380
wouldn't feel comfortable in their home

161
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,600
again

162
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400
and some pointed out how cameras can

163
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
facilitate

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,180
on a creepy Behavior or abuse

165
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,280
even nannies who generally wouldn't have

166
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,259
privacy concerns about smart home

167
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,120
cameras might feel uncomfortable if they

168
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,479
thought that cameras might encourage

169
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,060
those type of negative behaviors

170
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,620
on the other hand some participants

171
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,479
viewed cameras quite positively

172
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,940
a couple said that they felt that rather

173
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,740
than undermining trust cameras could

174
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,080
help build trust by reassuring parents

175
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,880
that nannies are taking good care of the

176
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,660
children

177
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,819
for example in any 12 said having

178
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,199
cameras give them the sense that I am

179
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,300
who I thought I was at the interview

180
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,220
cameras can also provide proof against

181
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,360
Accu accusations abuse or neglect

182
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,460
um like 9020 saying if the child gets a

183
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,960
bruised there's now proof on camera that

184
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,340
I'm not the one that caused that to

185
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,919
happen

186
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,060
participants also described their

187
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,860
privacy expectations and attitudes with

188
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,440
reference to context-specific privacy

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,580
norms

190
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,039
and Annie's workplace is also somebody's

191
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,319
home and Care work specifically has a

192
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,419
unique set of privacy considerations

193
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,300
so Norms about data collection including

194
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
who gets to make decisions about it can

195
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,979
combine Norms from those three contexts

196
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,319
regarding home privacy Norms some

197
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,180
participants viewed it as the

198
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,440
homeowner's prerogative to install

199
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,479
devices for example to protect the

200
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,340
safety of the home and to configure it

201
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,620
how they like they didn't expect to have

202
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,120
control of data collection in someone

203
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,300
else's home so nanny turn saying we're

204
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,800
kind of like Outsiders here in their

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
private homes so you know we need to

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,319
maybe give in a little bit of our

207
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,940
privacy

208
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,400
on the other hand others viewed homes as

209
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,960
private places and so the data

210
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,759
collection actually seemed incongruous

211
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,199
to them

212
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,780
participants cited workplace norms they

213
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,639
pointed out that monitoring employees is

214
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,400
not that uncommon generally some also

215
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,199
mentioned limitations on monitoring that

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,460
they would expect in a professional

217
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,919
workplace including expectation of

218
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,180
disclosure

219
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,340
for example 94 said for you it's a

220
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,020
workspace so I do think it's important

221
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,479
to know when and where there are cameras

222
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,699
participants also mentioned Norms of

223
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,860
caregiving including parents prerogative

224
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,620
to be involved in their child's care

225
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,360
some participants viewed monitoring as

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
more acceptable in the context of

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,180
caregiving than other types of work

228
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,860
because of the trade-off of children's

229
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,360
safety

230
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,919
um so nanny 29 said they have every

231
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,300
right to do whatever is in their power

232
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,120
to keep their children safe

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,039
participants described how the potential

234
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,020
impacts of cameras could influence

235
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,180
whether they would accept a job or even

236
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,800
whether they might quit a job they had

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,180
for example if employers were

238
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,820
micromanaging via camera or if they

239
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,799
found a hidden camera

240
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,899
so nanny 35 said that's actually the

241
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,279
reason why I left my previous Danny

242
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,539
family they would constantly check the

243
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,219
cameras and text me

244
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,958
however these kind of concerns would

245
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,640
usually have limited weight in a nanny's

246
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,620
job choices due to the socioeconomic

247
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,740
realities of the job market

248
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,940
um generally even though most

249
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,500
participants thought that employee

250
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,779
employers should disclose cameras so

251
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,339
that nannies can at least de facto

252
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,800
consent to data collection most saw

253
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,060
themselves as having a limited ability

254
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,700
to demand disclosure so is 1932 put it I

255
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,959
would expect disclosure but I know they

256
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,300
don't have to

257
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,240
in addition as I mentioned earlier

258
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
participants said they would like to

259
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
know more about specific details such as

260
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,339
frequency of checking the camera feed

261
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,260
whether the camera collects audio or

262
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,240
data retention but many participants

263
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,380
didn't feel they were in a position to

264
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
ask such questions or to ask for changes

265
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,740
to privacy settings if they even wanted

266
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,320
such changes for fear of violating

267
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,959
social norms and some were concerned

268
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,399
that asking questions might seem

269
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,880
suspicious like the ne26 said I don't

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,899
want to make it seem like I don't want

271
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,760
to be videotaped but then I would like

272
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,279
to ask because I'm curious

273
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,339
so implications during our analysis we

274
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,839
identified some potential points of

275
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,800
intervention

276
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,040
such as communication at time of hire

277
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,360
social norms about discussing privacy

278
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,940
settings with non-household members

279
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,140
design of access controls and device

280
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,500
indicators so to wrap up I'll swiftly

281
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,560
discuss some potential mitigations

282
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,480
first we propose to design discussion

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
guides to help parents and nannies

284
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,959
navigate conversations about cameras and

285
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,580
make it easier to introduce potentially

286
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,920
sensitive questions highlighting the

287
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,899
benefits of transparency suggesting

288
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,240
possible topics based on some of the

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,300
common questions that I mentioned

290
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,980
especially whether and how cameras will

291
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,380
be used to supervise the nanny

292
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,300
um devices devices could also nudge

293
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,380
their owners when they're configuring

294
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,959
the settings suggesting they discuss the

295
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,279
settings with anyone who works in the

296
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,740
house or writing a discussion guide

297
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,339
um

298
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,720
some of our participants said they'd

299
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,519
like to have some kind of access for

300
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,160
example to be able to use the devices

301
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,720
maybe monitor

302
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,000
and appropriate nudges can also steer

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,440
employers away from accidentally

304
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,260
violating domestic workers privacy

305
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,300
and these ideas could be supported by

306
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,220
product design guidelines that provide

307
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,440
nuanced guideline new guidance about

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,300
specific privacy issues for domestic

309
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,220
workers and recommendations for

310
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,839
balancing the needs of employers and

311
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,000
employees

312
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,720
thank you
