1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
thank you very much

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
um so yeah my name is Nicholas Thurman I

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,240
will present our work if you can't get

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,119
them to the lab today let's start with

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,859
some motivation

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,260
um so first of all uh

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,800
first of all online studies

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,500
allow we really we prefer online studies

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,420
because they allow a higher recruitment

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,300
volume than lab studies in general that

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,219
has been our experience in the past and

13
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,579
so especially in the last three years we

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,059
had covid-19 which made conducting lab

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,579
studies nearly impossible so there were

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,100
a lot of restrictions there if you

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,600
wanted to conduct the lab study you had

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,280
to uh

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,379
really take care of your participants

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,879
and you had to really take care yourself

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,600
as well to isolate to be vaccinated to

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,739
uh

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,860
not infect anyone

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,799
and so in order to solve that we took a

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,020
research progress approach to build a

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,580
tool

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,220
um we started with a literature review

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,220
which we used in order to um

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,920
build a requirement analysis for a

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,799
online tool

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,659
then implemented an online tool that we

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,180
called olap

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,080
and evaluated olap in three user

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,060
experience oriented studies

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,680
so

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,060
um we'll start with the literature

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,900
review

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
we looked at uh usable security studies

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,000
proven developers because that's our use

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,540
case or reusable security studies using

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,040
Developers

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,899
and we reviewed 24 papers in detail

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,700
from

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,560
all the major usable security

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,200
conferences

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,259
so soups usenix SMP

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,818
and we essentially looked at all of the

48
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,400
study environments the methods that they

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,340
used the tools that they used and the

50
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,640
tasks that developers or other types of

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,319
participants had to work on Within These

52
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,640
studies

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,420
and we arrived at requirements for

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,239
security focused developer studies that

55
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,739
uh

56
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,900
build like followers

57
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,640
so the first one is a requirement for

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,459
very diverse study setups so study

59
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,379
setups that uh

60
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,620
range from specific tool support to like

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,760
uh

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
different programming languages

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,019
different system environments different

64
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,140
operating systems

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,200
we require a high accessibility for

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
participants so a low barrier to your

67
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,060
entry for all of our participants

68
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,860
and we

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,640
um

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,220
require a wide range of data collection

71
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,800
options so we want to collect the source

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,019
code that they submit but we also want

73
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,360
to collect more specific requirements

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,659
like copy and paste events or

75
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,540
um Mouse clicks Etc all this kind of

76
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,420
stuff in a uh yeah all this kind of

77
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,220
stuff we can usually collect at a lab

78
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,980
environment and we now want to collect

79
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,099
it in a virtual study environment

80
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,159
um which we call online so after this

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,659
requirement analysis we actually

82
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,480
implemented a prototype which looks like

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,200
this it is essentially a website that

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,799
offers a virtual container with a full

85
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,680
desktop with applications so you can see

86
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,700
uh

87
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,760
a jet planes

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,459
study set up with a browser where they

89
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,980
can browse a documentation

90
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,099
and a study task description that we

91
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,819
provide alongside with the study

92
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,799
the advantages of such an approach are

93
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,459
as follows we can use a domain to have

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,920
the user access easily but also securely

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
with participant specific tokens

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,780
it's applied to each participant that

97
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,940
you recruit

98
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,600
um

99
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,660
our tool Works in any HTML5 capable

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,040
browser so in any current version of

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,220
modern popular browsers

102
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,960
it has no setup requirements at all so

103
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,139
this the participant only has to go to

104
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,940
that website in order to participate in

105
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,740
the study

106
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,320
um it uh

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,660
gives us full control over the study

108
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,240
environment we choose the Ides that they

109
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,419
use we choose the plugins and the uh I

110
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:49,919
don't know python dependencies or

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,100
similar that they have installed

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,040
and uh due to the online approach it is

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,800
scalable and allows for unsupervised lab

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,100
studies in in or lab-like studies in an

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,960
online environment

116
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,820
yeah

117
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,979
um so during time constraints we will

118
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,840
not focus on the technical details here

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,360
but to give you a quick overview over

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,320
how a participant experiences olap

121
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
um it starts with a typical content form

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
and introduction to the study where they

123
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,139
can see all the information and then

124
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,600
they can agree

125
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,259
um

126
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,020
then we show them a few instructions

127
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,259
about olap itself and about the study

128
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,960
that they are about to participate in we

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,400
also have a nice progress bar for them

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,580
to uh yeah see how far they are in the

131
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,360
study

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,880
then we have the actual task with a task

133
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,919
description and the virtual environment

134
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,900
that I've already presented

135
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
and afterwards we have support for

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,759
redirection to a survey tool like lime

137
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,380
survey or quadrics so they can

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,960
participate in post-task service

139
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,940
if you have multiple tasks within a

140
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,340
study of course steps two to four can be

141
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,580
repeated so olap essentially supports

142
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,419
full complex study setups

143
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,380
um yeah then we evaluated collab olap we

144
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,220
first conducted to smaller studies a

145
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,500
cognitive workflow for usability experts

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,860
and a supervised studies with new lines

147
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,960
segments

148
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,720
um our setup was essentially a server

149
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,419
that was attacked that we provided a

150
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,340
backup of individual study environment

151
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,160
together with typical sysadmin tools so

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,860
participants could investigate what

153
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,780
happened on that server

154
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,620
and for the user experience of all our

155
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,199
key findings where a few iterative

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,419
improvements or clarifications of labels

157
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,220
clarifications of uh IQ account

158
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,199
iconography within the tool

159
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,919
um

160
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,280
and also that olap has occasionally low

161
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,120
system requirements and we we require 8m

162
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,360
bit of Downstream

163
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,180
for the video stream but only 0.8 Ambit

164
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,280
of Upstream

165
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,039
um yeah then we conducted a more complex

166
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,100
study with 16 participants a comparison

167
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,539
experiment

168
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,300
this was inspired or this was a crypto

169
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,720
API task inspired by ajar at all

170
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,340
um a previous paper

171
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,560
where where participants had to

172
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,919
implement and actually

173
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,039
python crypto API task

174
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,340
and we let them implement the same two

175
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,440
tasks within two different study

176
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,979
environments once our olap and then a

177
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,199
additional download study setup where

178
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,340
they uh

179
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,340
had to manually download the project

180
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,380
that we provided them instead of working

181
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,919
in a virtual machine

182
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,139
yeah this is what it looked like so our

183
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,759
virtual machine essentially provided the

184
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,960
full environment

185
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,720
while the website we provided for the

186
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,759
download study provided a link to the

187
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,220
documentation and a download link for

188
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,919
the project

189
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,259
here our key findings were that within

190
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,000
all out the task description is more

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,580
present to the participants so that

192
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,400
would be less misconceptions about parts

193
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,500
of the task

194
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,300
um we found out that both tools have a

195
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,440
similar overall Sub sub score

196
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,940
we found out that with an olap we have

197
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,639
higher control over the study variables

198
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,860
so in the download study participants

199
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,899
would often ignore the pycharm

200
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,940
requirement and go to for example vs

201
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,039
code if that is still preferred

202
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,979
environment

203
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,839
and we have a much higher accessibility

204
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,380
so participants reported liking olap for

205
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,200
not having to install their own python

206
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
dependencies for example

207
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,080
um yeah that's the major uh study we

208
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,899
conducted now really quickly for ongoing

209
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,580
work

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,339
um in the future we plan to evaluate the

211
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,980
usability of olap for other researchers

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,260
that's an important part so we optimize

213
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,560
participant usability but the tool also

214
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,019
has to be usable for developers that

215
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,839
want to work with it

216
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,820
we want to evaluate the tool itself with

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
larger study samples so real world mtech

218
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,380
studies for example

219
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,720
uh with multiple hundreds of

220
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,300
participants

221
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,640
we want to work on licensing

222
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,399
documentation and making the code look

223
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,260
nice so other people can work with it

224
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,180
without problems

225
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,779
and we want to evaluate all up compared

226
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,700
to a real world lab study

227
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,000
and finally we want to investigate

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,820
future features so like a theoretical

229
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,240
collaboration features within the tool

230
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,920
for this part especially your feedback

231
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,200
or the feedback of other researchers is

232
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
very welcome

233
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,080
um yeah that concludes my talk uh here

234
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,000
is a quick summary of all the important

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,760
points thank you very much do you have

236
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
any questions
