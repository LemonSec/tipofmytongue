1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,599
I'm Philip welcome to the talk of our

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,059
paper as soon as it's a risk I won't

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,240
require MFA today we're going to talk

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,760
about how administrators configure

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,500
risk-based Authentication

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,300
as this joint worked with three awesome

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,340
colleagues of mine so I would like to

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,220
thank Tio Max as well as Marcos for the

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,420
help

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,360
but before we start let's go back in

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,219
time a bit let's go back to the moment

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,920
when you arrived in Boston

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
at that point some of you may have

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,559
received a notification asking you hey

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,440
was that you logging in from Boston or

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,260
hey we just noticed a new sign into your

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,960
device was that you

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,180
what happened at that point was

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,340
risk-based Authentication

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,960
I tried to sum it up in one little

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,460
sentence

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,219
during the login of user calculate a

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,799
risk based on contextual factors like

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,400
for example the device and the location

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,799
what it means in my everyday case is I

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,659
have my Android device and a login from

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,460
boohum here in Germany

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,640
and that might be Associated a low risk

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,479
there's nothing special about the slogan

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,400
now let's assume I would have been able

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,259
to travel to Boston I would have taken

33
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,060
my device with me and the only thing

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,299
that differs is the location so a medium

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,560
risk

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,740
a little thought experiment someone with

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,840
my login credentials logging in on an

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,380
iOS device in a research station in the

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,259
Antarctica that might be Associated at

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,600
high risk this login is completely

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,460
strange and there is nothing usual about

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,380
it at all

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,680
so this is risk-based authentication or

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,560
at least the basis of it now let's move

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,680
on to the actual configuration the

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,840
configuration system that we analyzed in

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,020
our study is based on Amazon why Amazon

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,299
well first of all it is a good

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,060
representative across all 16 different

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,180
services that we analyzed and in

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,980
addition to that it is also the market

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,379
leader in this field so many many

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,200
administrators may have a high chance of

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,900
seeing it during the everyday

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,599
Life as a system administrator when

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,060
configuring with space Authentication

57
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,099
now the first thing that needs to be

58
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,160
configured is the behavior so the

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,640
reaction in response to the risk level

60
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,680
there are four different ones for

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
different behaviors the first one is

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,459
just simply allowing a login the second

63
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,819
one optional MFA means requiring MFA for

64
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,440
those who have set it up and just

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
allowing the login for those who have

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,239
not set it up and then required MFA

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,700
means requiring it and if you have not

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,340
set it up your login will be blocked and

69
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,040
block simply means that the login will

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
be disallowed

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,760
the second the second thing that needs

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,459
to be configured is whether or not we

73
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,620
want to notify the user

74
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,560
binary decisions so we either notify you

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,659
know the user or not

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,360
in this case like I said Yale I usually

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,040
log in for both home

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,739
I usually don't receive notification

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,080
when logging in from Boston that may be

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
the case so this needs to be configured

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
the third thing that could be configured

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,440
in our system here was change

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,540
notification not again this is a binary

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,500
decision

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
changing it or not changing it however I

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,640
would like to leave that to the

87
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,040
interested Visa reader due to the type

88
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,080
constraints that we have

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,599
now let's move on to the actual research

90
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,379
questions

91
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,599
the first one is very simple how do

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,700
administrators configure risk-based

93
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,400
authentication the second one Builds on

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,860
top of it what happens when they

95
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,599
configure it which obstacles and

96
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,480
misunderstandings do they encounter

97
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,760
the third one is a bit more complex

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,980
what is the impact of previous exposure

99
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,959
to other ABA systems is that they are

100
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,239
different ones out there and multiple of

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,879
them and how the different requirements

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,760
influence administrators however again I

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,379
would like to lead that to the

104
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,180
interested reader

105
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,579
now let's move on to the methods how did

106
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,160
we answer our research questions

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,779
the first thing that let our

108
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,240
administrators do is we let them

109
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
configure the risk-based authentication

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
again Based On A system that is

111
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
influenced by Amazon

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,639
afterwards

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
we gave them or before that we gave them

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,780
a scenario telling them well you know

115
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,340
the system administrators of the media

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,380
shop Corporation and please enable

117
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,560
risk-based authentication for the shop

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,580
dress code.com

119
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,780
afterwards they were given some

120
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,880
questions as part of that for example

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
the system usability scale and at the

122
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,620
very end our interviews which we

123
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,960
conducted with each of our participants

124
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,699
how many participants were there well

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,520
there were 28 administrators and all of

126
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,880
them worked as administrators

127
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,220
how long did they work as administrators

128
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,160
well some of them only a short time but

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,220
many of them work more than 10 years and

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,040
some of them even more than 15 years

131
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,380
uh of experience I have more than 15

132
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,199
years of experience in their job as an

133
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,479
administrators

134
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,479
okay now on to the very first research

135
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,820
question how do administrators configure

136
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,500
ABA at all

137
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,199
again we have our three risk levels low

138
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,900
medium and high and our behaviors that

139
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,139
we can choose in response to them so

140
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,660
they allow optional require NFA and the

141
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,680
block

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
now let's see what our administrators in

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,340
our study chose for the low risk

144
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,860
nine of them went with allowing the log

145
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,060
in and 19 in total went with one of the

146
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,759
two forms of multi-factor authentication

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,979
in for low risk

148
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,560
when asking them about the configuration

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,020
one of them said well as soon as it's a

150
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,180
risk I simply want to require anything

151
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,180
how is it for the medium risk

152
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,880
most of them went with the optional MFA

153
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,680
and some of them went with the

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,139
requirement of a butting in the majority

155
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,360
one with the option on with a here so

156
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
either requiring it for the ones who

157
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,500
have set it up or just simply allowing

158
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,139
the login for those who have not

159
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,300
for the high risk situation is different

160
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,720
again 17 when with requiring MFA and

161
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,979
even 10 decided to block inks which are

162
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,319
associated a high risk

163
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,060
when asking participants about the

164
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,400
configuration all of them said well it

165
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,919
is just dresscode.com had it been my

166
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,720
bank maybe block

167
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,100
is more prudent so this participants

168
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,840
considered the scenario and such for a

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,819
different scenario

170
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,280
a different outcome may have been

171
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,900
possible

172
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,360
all right now on to the notification

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,160
again this is a binary decision even

174
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,100
notifying the user or not let's see what

175
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,139
the administrators went with for the

176
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,180
loan risk

177
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,360
21 went with notifying users in that

178
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,120
case with seven decided to deactivate

179
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
the notification

180
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,740
one of them said if you get bombarded

181
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,680
with login notifications you get annoyed

182
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,199
and that's why this participant decided

183
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,660
to deactivate the notification for low

184
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,340
risk logins

185
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,220
for the medium and the highest the

186
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,380
situation is similar

187
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,599
because the majority is simply went with

188
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,500
notifying the user in those cases

189
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,900
all right so far for the very first

190
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,419
research question let's go on to the

191
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,880
second one the obstacles and

192
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,620
misunderstandings

193
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,020
first part here deals with the

194
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,699
understanding of the risk love

195
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,979
calculation because this is something

196
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,380
that the administrators in our study

197
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,180
demand

198
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,099
one participant said if I don't know

199
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,020
exactly what low medium or high risk

200
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,180
means then there's no reason for me to

201
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,280
distinguish between them

202
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,580
and what does it mean well this affects

203
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,220
the user because there's like no

204
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,780
difference at all between the different

205
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,120
risk levels and this is what initially

206
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
risk-based authentication is all about

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,099
it's different outcomes based on

208
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,379
different risk levels

209
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,899
a second participant had a similar

210
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,580
answer still it was a bit different

211
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,580
let's see which parameters classify low

212
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,320
medium or high risk that would

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,599
definitely be a criteria for me when

214
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,360
adopting it so again this participant

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
wanted to understand what medium-high

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,260
low risk means however the outcome is

217
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,899
different because this reduces sales

218
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,080
because it affects the company that

219
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,279
offers the service but not the users

220
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,459
second part here is the awareness about

221
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,680
all risk levels and this is something

222
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,660
that different Services solve

223
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,459
differently but the way that this is

224
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,620
solved in this case here so this is

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,160
special for Amazon is as follows

226
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,140
I told you about the three risk levels

227
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,000
so low medium on high and the

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
configuration that can be selected in

229
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
response to it however there's also a

230
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,640
fourth outcome and that is no risk at

231
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
all

232
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
and if the system decides there is no

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
risk about a login the login is always

234
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,660
loud

235
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,580
however this is not part of the actual

236
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,279
configuration and this is not seen in

237
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,080
the interface at all but this is

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
something that the system does

239
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,740
underneath

240
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,680
other systems or service power Services

241
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,899
who offer request indications solve that

242
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,740
differently by making all risk outcomes

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
so even the no risk outcome part of the

244
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
actual configuration so that

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,240
administrators are aware about all comes

246
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
at all points in time

247
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,940
third aspects the understanding of

248
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,860
crucial terms they are different ones

249
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,839
which are crucial I picked the two most

250
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,540
interesting ones in my opinion first one

251
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,399
is the optional MFA

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,200
again I said

253
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,100
it is the case here so either the user

254
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,120
has set MFA up for the account then it

255
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,420
is required and asked for at that point

256
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,640
or if users have not set it up

257
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,580
the system will simply continue as it

258
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,200
would be an allow

259
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,899
this is something which is not

260
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,300
well let's say normal to an

261
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,980
administrator has to not work with that

262
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,320
systems before and one of our

263
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,899
administrators in study said well an

264
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,760
attacker will just skip it and for users

265
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,800
it's just convenient to skip it

266
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,040
so this administrators did not have a

267
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,820
look

268
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,459
in more detailed information about the

269
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,740
login or what the about the outcome that

270
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,019
can be selected but came up with very

271
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,120
own interpretation of it which of course

272
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,820
makes sense given that it says optional

273
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,959
MFA however this makes uh close to Korea

274
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,180
that information needs to be present at

275
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,040
the point of the configure at the point

276
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,680
in time when administrators do the

277
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,480
actual configuration

278
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,240
a second and even more prominent example

279
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,940
is the block for all of us it makes

280
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,579
sense that well it's just simply a block

281
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,100
of the login yes that's what the

282
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,899
participants in our study said as well

283
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,060
however one participant asks very

284
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,220
detailed questions how long will the

285
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,500
block last for is this an indefinite

286
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
block or is it just a Slowdown of the

287
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,899
login attempts all legitimate questions

288
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,480
and administrators demand this

289
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,399
information because they are not just

290
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,680
everyday users they are the ones who

291
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,019
have to configure it so they really need

292
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,420
this information

293
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,300
all right and this already brings me to

294
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,880
the end of my talk let's sum it up real

295
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,040
quick the first thing that we talked

296
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,720
about is the risk-based authentication

297
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,940
so the three risk levels and the

298
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,980
configuration options that we have

299
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,380
afterwards we talked a bit about the

300
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,820
method that we use in order to answer

301
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
our research questions and finally I

302
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,519
gave you a brief Outlook of our results

303
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,980
again there are many many more so please

304
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,680
feel free to ask me afterwards or have a

305
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,779
look at our paper

306
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,480
and that brings me to the end feel free

307
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,040
to contact me at any time ask me

308
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
questions now afterwards we have

309
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,180
different ways of contacting me I'm

310
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,579
happy to answer anything that you will

311
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,939
ask me
