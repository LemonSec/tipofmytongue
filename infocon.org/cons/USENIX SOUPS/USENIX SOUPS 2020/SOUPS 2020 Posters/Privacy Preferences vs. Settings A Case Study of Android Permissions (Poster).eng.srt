hello my name is jaclyn white i'm a phd

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,079
student at unc charlotte

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,679
understanding user privacy preferences

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,840
is useful for the design and development

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
of privacy mechanisms and applications

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
yet preferences often differ from

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
behavior to gain a deeper understanding

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
of this we started by asking

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
how much does express comfort and stated

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,119
preferences differ from actual behavior

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
we conducted a qualtric survey of 96

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,558
people on amazon mechanical turk

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,559
in this survey participants were asked

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,919
to name five of their most used apps

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,760
for each app will be asked questions

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
about nine specific android permissions

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,879
across three categories

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
comfort desired permissions and actual

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,320
permissions this chart shows the results

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
for each category across

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
all the received responses we found that

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,680
desired permission sharing is generally

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
lower than actual permission sharing

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
and the user's comfort level permissions

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079
is generally higher than actual desired

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,440
permissions

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,120
indicating they're generally comfortable

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
sharing data with apps even though

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,680
they'd often prefer to leave permissions

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,279
turned off

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,559
do these differences in express comfort

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,159
and preferences a more accurate

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,679
indicator of privacy settings

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,960
may be desired permission settings

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
rather than express comfort with

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
permissions

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
