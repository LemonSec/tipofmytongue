1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,799
older adults in singapore have been

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,758
higher adopters of smartphones over the

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,678
last few years

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,600
but the lack of privacy and security

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,359
knowledge puts them at higher risk

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
we conducted 20 semi-structured

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
interviews with a mix of older adult and

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
adult helpers

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,799
firstly we identified that older adults

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
are mainly reliant on their social

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
circle for getting help

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
and learning about privacy and security

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
however family members

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
at opacity of an older adult online

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,440
safety

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,520
next we found that attitudinal and

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,160
cultural factors affected learning

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
behavior

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,480
finally we found that although older

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,280
adults express contextual preferences of

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,519
privacy

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,039
they were unaware about data flows and

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
privacy mechanisms

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,559
there was also contrasting perceptions

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,440
of convenience versus privacy and

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,120
security between older adults and adults

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
in future we would like to deploy an

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
inclusive technology pro

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,718
to investigate social impact of an older

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
adult's privacy and security and

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:13,840
convenience versus privacy and security

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:13,840
in greater depth thank you

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,039
you
