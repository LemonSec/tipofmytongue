00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,920
will present

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,079
our study on end users information

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
sharing behaviors and preferences within

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,080
a multi-user smart home

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
lte devices are commonly adopted at

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,919
homes by sharing the devices multiple

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
users can access the information

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
associated with the device

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,439
for example by sharing a smart speaker

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,000
multiple users can access the

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,399
information

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
associated with the speaker such as the

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
contact list

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,559
reminder calendar and to-do list when

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,879
there are many devices adopted at home

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,000
various types of information associated

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,919
with the device

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,680
could be accessed by users who live in

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,360
the same household

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,399
in this study we aim to answer the

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,120
following detailed research questions

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
so far our preliminary findings reveal

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
that

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
primary users usually lead the

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,160
purchasing process of the smart devices

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,879
and major rules of sharing the devices

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,319
also most

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,640
participants have a limited

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:13,840
understanding of how their smart devices

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:13,840
are being shared

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
