1
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,160
how do you think

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,000
users behave when they lose or identify

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
unauthorized access to their online

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,039
accounts

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,840
in 2019 620 million online accounts were

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
hacked

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,198
even though previous research have

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,800
investigated many different areas to

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,840
improve security and privacy against

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,760
cyber attacks

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,198
there is a lack of understanding how

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,359
users will behave

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,719
upon losing or identifying unauthorized

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399
access to their online accounts

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
so we conducted semi-structured

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,399
interviews with 22 participants to

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,719
investigate these questions

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
we found that most of our participants

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,800
either lost or identified unauthorized

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,559
access to their financial or identity

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,879
accounts in the past

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,680
we also explored the background reasons

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,599
of losing access to online accounts

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,360
in addition we listed common security

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,559
misconceptions of users

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,879
identified from the interviews we also

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,319
identified the prevention strategies and

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,000
contingency plans of

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,000
participants to protect their online

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
accounts

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,399
