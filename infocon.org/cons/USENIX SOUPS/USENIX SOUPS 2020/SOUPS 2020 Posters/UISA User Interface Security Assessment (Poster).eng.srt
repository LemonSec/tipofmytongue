our collaborative team

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,239
from unc charlotte and bank of america

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
proposed the user interface security

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,720
assessment method

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,519
usa to allow application designers

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,160
and developers to assess the security

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,880
risks

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,320
that result from user interaction with a

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,399
particular application interface

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
inspired from human reliability

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
assessment methods

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,360
the usa process involves five steps

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,559
to identify possible human errors in an

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
interface

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,959
everything from unintentional sleeps to

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
intentional lack of use

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
and their potential security

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
consequences

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,839
guided by a handbook the method helps

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
evaluators

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
identify design triggers for those

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
errors

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,359
allowing stakeholders to discuss compare

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:12,560
and improve interface designs based on

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:14,640
security concerns

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
