1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,799
poster is on the effects of priming on

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,559
smart on privacy preferences

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
we were interested to see if priming can

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,400
impact users consideration of different

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,038
available privacy settings and whether

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,640
it will influence their choice

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
so our manipulation was priming we

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,400
either showed participants a negative or

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
a positive text about smart home iot

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
then they saw different privacy setting

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
profiles and some info about each of

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,320
these profiles

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,399
lastly participants were asked to select

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
one of these profiles as their setting

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
we used an eye tracking methodology and

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,200
participants were being attracted to

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
this experiment

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,840
we recruited 18 participants our

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
analysis suggests that different primary

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,160
conditions do not affect gaze or profile

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
selection

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,680
however our sample was small and we had

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,520
a low statistical power

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
heat maps showed that those who were

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,520
negatively pride considered a wider

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,199
range of profiles more specifically

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
the profiles with more restricted

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
sharing settings

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:13,600
future studies can consider a higher end

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:13,600
to have sufficient statistical power
