this research aims to identify

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
and address the privacy security and

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
usability challenges faced by public

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
computer users

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
especially those who do not have access

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,240
to their own home computer and or

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,080
high-speed internet

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,159
these users share an experience of

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,198
digital insecurity we call digital

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
homelessness

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,880
our findings expose the assumption

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
embedded in many of the techno-social

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,519
systems upon which everyday life now

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,360
depends

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
that citizens have their own digital

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,239
homes the experience of digital

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,160
homelessness

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,640
compounds other forms of social

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,718
inequality

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
we recommend future research to validate

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
and elaborate our initial findings

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
and advocate for cost-effective tech

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,079
solutions that address the unique

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,839
problems faced by those experiencing

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
digital homelessness
