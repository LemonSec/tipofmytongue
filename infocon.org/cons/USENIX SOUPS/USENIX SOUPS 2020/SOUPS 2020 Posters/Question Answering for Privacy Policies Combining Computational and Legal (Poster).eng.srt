hi

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,959
i'm abhilasha and today i will be

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,879
talking about question answering for

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,279
privacy policies

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,359
this is work with my advisor norman sade

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
as part of the usable privacy policy

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,000
project

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,920
now privacy policies are legal documents

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,119
that disclose how companies use and

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
manage our data

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,560
but they are typically very difficult

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
for users to actually read and

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,000
understand

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
so how can we present the information in

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
privacy policies

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,800
to users in a way that enables them to

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,719
make informed privacy decisions

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,640
this turns out to be very challenging

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
because the privacy compromises

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,239
every user is willing to make can be

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,360
highly individual

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,919
so instead why don't we let users ask

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,519
questions

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,920
about the issues they care about

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,479
to facilitate the development of

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
automated privacy question answering

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,479
we contribute a privacy question

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
answering corpus

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,439
where people ask privacy related

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,759
questions about mobile apps

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,000
and answers to these questions are

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,520
sourced from legal experts

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,840
we then train machine learning

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,840
classifiers to generate these answers

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,200
