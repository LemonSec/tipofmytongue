1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,639
smart home updates user perceptions and

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,160
experiences

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,920
smart home updates are a critical

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
mechanism by which manufacturers can

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,439
distribute security patches

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,960
however the ways in which updates are

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,119
installed and made known can vary

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,119
greatly depending on the device

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,640
although researchers have studied it

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,320
update experiences

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
perceptions and challenges with smart

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,440
home updates have not yet been fully

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
explored we conducted interviews of 40

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
smart home users

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,920
the interview was broad in nature

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
including installation maintenance

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
privacy and security

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,039
analysis of a subset of data revealed

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,280
interesting observations about updates

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
participants expressed confusion about

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
if and when updates were applied due to

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
inconsistencies and update mechanisms

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
from device to device

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
and lack of transparency about update

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
purpose and status

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,079
we also observed that few participants

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,519
mentioned updates in the context of

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,199
security

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
since updates were not the focus of the

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:13,840
interview we plan to take a more

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:13,840
in-depth look via a broader survey

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
