00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
research is centered around what methods

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
are currently being used in videos to

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
educate people about facebook privacy

leveraging a popular video sharing

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,920
platform youtube we have conducted an

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
extensive search to find relevant videos

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,239
that address the topic of facebook

00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,199
dating back to 2011. after watching

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
approximately 200 videos we identified

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
the most common concepts and themes

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
which were prevalent in the videos

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
we were able to narrow down the common

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
concepts and themes to six

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,440
clearly defined subject areas we also

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,879
identified three distinct video

videos

28

in the past decade although we have made

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,280
considerable progress with understanding
