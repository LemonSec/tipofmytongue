hello

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,479
i'm eric an undergraduate student at the

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
university of maryland i'll be

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,440
introducing our research on cyber

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,199
security learning

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
our work shows that online exercises

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,400
including capture the flag competitions

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
and more games are useful educational

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
tools

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,799
however much of this research is lacking

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359
as they consider very few exercises and

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
only

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
focus on a few measures of learning we

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
centered our research around analyzing

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,159
multiple

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
online hacking exercises evaluating them

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,078
off of a set of pedagogical principles

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
as a follow-up we also interviewed

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
organizers of these exercises to

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
understand challenges they may face in

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
development

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
in creating our framework we found five

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,920
core dimensions shown here encoded each

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,879
exercise to see which principles it

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,800
applied

26
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,480
no exercise implemented every principle

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
but most principles were implemented by

28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,239
at least one of the exercises

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,919
overall we found that support and online

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,160
communities were common while structure

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
feedback and metacognition were lacking

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
these results may be able to help

33
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:12,640
organizers improve their exercises to

34
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:14,720
support better learning outcomes

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
