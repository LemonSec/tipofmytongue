state university

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,759
most users of sensor based technologies

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,840
consent to sharing their data with

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
limited or no understanding

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,439
of the extent of data collection

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
possible uses of the data

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,759
and the previous implications thereof

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
while sensor data may seem non-sensitive

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,640
on its own

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
aggregation of such data produces

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,760
inferences with

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
new insights which can be harmful

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,480
surprising and sensitive

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
when used for purposes users do not

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,919
expect

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
research suggests that provoking

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,360
speculation about data that systems

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,280
collect and infer

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,120
can help to improve user knowledge and

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
privacy decisions

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,519
we argue that creating inferences

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
showing surprising and unexpected system

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
behaviors can provoke privacy

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
speculation

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,680
we present a model of how researchers

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,519
can create these surprising inferences

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,440
to guide studies to understand user

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
reactions and expectations

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,039
from systems and platforms that use

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,840
sensor-based

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,840
technologies thank you

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,200
you
