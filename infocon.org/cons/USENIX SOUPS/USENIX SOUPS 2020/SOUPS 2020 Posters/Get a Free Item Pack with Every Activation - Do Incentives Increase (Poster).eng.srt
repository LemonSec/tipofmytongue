1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,719
within online gaming publishers often

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,879
offer incentives that are rewarded when

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,640
two-factor authentication is activated

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
incentive types are diverse and include

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
visual enhancements exclusive content or

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
gameplay advantages

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
in this work we want to evaluate how

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
these incentives can be translated to

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,759
other fields such as online banking

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
to answer this we first conducted two

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
surveys with different target audiences

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,280
to explore to fa adoption and usage

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,600
as well as likelihood to adopt in

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
different scenarios based on our results

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
we will design mockups for non-gaming

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
incentives

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,239
which we discussed in the focus group

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
study overall we draw three major

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,160
proposals from our results

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
we find that monetary incentives such as

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,599
discounts were the most attractive

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
so we suggest that vendors offer them

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,280
more feasible as for preferred 2fa

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,079
method and incentive is highly

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
subjective

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
having a wider variety of options could

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079
open up to a va to more users

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
finally we argue that more educational

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,440
material could resolve some of the lack

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,440
of knowledge and misconceptions we

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
observed

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
