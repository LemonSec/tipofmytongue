hello i'm karen bonilla and i'm a

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,559
student at iupui school of informatics

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
and computing

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,599
intelligent virtual assistants like

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
alexa google home hold great potential

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,840
to help older adults with their daily

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,359
health tasks

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
but due to increased concern over

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
privacy and security information

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,800
there's been a lack of incentive to use

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
these devices so our main problem is to

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
understand older adults experiences with

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
ivs related to privacy and data

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
confidentiality concerns

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
ideal resolution was seven

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,640
semi-structured interviews that were

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
conducted with older adults above the

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
age of 60.

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
it all purchased or received an iv

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
within the last year and these

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
interviews were then

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,360
transcribed and analyzed using atlas.ti

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,360
for emerging themes

24
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,440
the results of these interviews included

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,280
a list of themes shown above

26
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,879
participants were also unaware of where

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
to find information about data privacy

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
is

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,879
slash use when asked and felt current

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,399
online privacy guides needed improvement

31
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,839
in future phases this project will

32
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,039
compare the experiences of other users

33
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,960
such as younger adults

34
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
we believe our findings can help inform

35
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,680
strategies for improving the

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,559
presentation and usability of privacy

37
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
information

38
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:13,840
and controls among older adults but also

39
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,839
users more generally

40
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
