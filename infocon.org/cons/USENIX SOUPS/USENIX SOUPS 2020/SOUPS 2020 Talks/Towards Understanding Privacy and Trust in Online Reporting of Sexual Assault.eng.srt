00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,879
hi everyone

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,040
my name is bokay and today i'll be

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,760
presenting the research titled

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
towards understanding privacy and trust

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,480
in online reporting of sexual assault

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
i worked on this research together with

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,480
lucretia from wester

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,320
and also constantine from the university

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
of british columbia

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,960
so i'm going to jump right in why is

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
this research important

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
sexual assault which is also referred to

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,719
as rape

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,879
is the most underreported crime globally

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,800
statistic shows that sexual assault

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,440
happens to a very large percentage of

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,399
the population

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,079
for example for every three canadian

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,399
women

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,480
at least one has experienced rape

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,680
furthermore for every five american

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
women

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
at least one has been sexually assaulted

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,600
the males are also not left behind for

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
every 14 male

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,479
at least one as a down the gun completed

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,520
or attempted rape in their adult life

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
sexual assault as i said before is the

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,679
world's most

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,600
underreported crime whereby 95 percent

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,280
of sexual assault incidents

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,798
are never reported and of every 1 000

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,720
perpetrators

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
only five ever get arrested

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,520
sexual assault also like every other

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,920
crime unlike every other crime

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,840
has long-term effect for example if your

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,320
car is stolen you may feel sad for a

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
while

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
and then maybe get over it for sexual

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,000
assault most survivors undergo long-term

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,039
effects such as post-traumatic stress

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
disorder

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
substance abuse depression suicidal

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,479
thoughts

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,200
and even in some cases suicide

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,960
so what exactly is the problem why do

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
people not report sexual assault

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,798
why is it largely why does it happen to

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,079
a lot of people and yet it is on the

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,760
report that even though it has

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,000
long-term effects research has shown

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,959
that due to the cumbersome reporting

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,959
process

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
and the growing interview procedure that

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,599
survivors have to go through with the

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
police

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
and also because even after going

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,640
through this process

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,760
survivors fear that the police would not

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,079
believe them

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,640
as such most survivors would rather not

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360
report the crime

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,040
in order to solve this problem third

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,800
party reporting systems have been

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,959
introduced

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
essentially third party is when somebody

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
else anonymously reports the sexual

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,679
assault

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,839
on behalf of the survivor

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
what we are talking about is a

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,440
systematic reporting protocol

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,200
or a community agency like a sexual

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,239
assault center

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,359
act as an intermediary

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
so currently how this works is if a

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,959
survivor wants to use a third party

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,879
reporting system

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
the survivor can walk into a sexual

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
assault center

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,238
that supports third party reporting

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
system

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,159
at the center the survivor is invited to

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,319
complete a third party reporting form

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,159
when survivor fills the form the

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,440
survivor hands the form over to a

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
support worker

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,840
who anonymizes the form and then submits

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,080
it to the police

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
now through this process the survivor

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
does not have to undergo the growing

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
interview procedure

93
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,680
with the police but there is a record

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
for the survivor's behalf

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,440
that at least that sexual assault

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
incident happened

97
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,000
the goal of third party reporting system

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,920
also is that it leads the survivor to

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
have more control over their reporting

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
process

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,879
if the police have further questions or

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
if they identify a pattern or a serial

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,518
offender

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
the police can then contact the center

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,239
who then contacts the survivor to ask

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,159
for more clarification question

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
or to invite them to make a formal

108
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,640
police report

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,720
reset shows that when this happens when

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
survivors are invited to make a formal

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,798
police report they are more likely to do

112
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,719
so because they know that they will be

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,880
believed

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
however all of this process right now is

115
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
done on paper

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,520
and so therefore there are restrictions

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
on this

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,400
for example the survivor has to locate a

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
center that supports third party

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
reporting system

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,840
and this is only available in select do

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
restrictions

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,479
and so ultimately it almost defeats the

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,240
purpose of increasing reporting

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,080
the idea of an online third-party

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,080
reporting system

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,199
is that it can be accessed by more

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,840
survivors

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,759
who do not want to or cannot walk into a

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,599
center

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
the way an online third party reporting

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
system works

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,799
is that rather than the survivor walking

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,080
into the center

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,919
the survivor at their own convenience

136
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
can download an online third party

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,560
reporting system as an app on their

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,599
phone

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,440
or visit visited through a website

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
now this online third-party reporting

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
system anonymizes the report when they

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
are done filling it out

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,159
and submits it to the police for an

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
online system to hold sensitive

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
information

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,720
some questions need to be answered

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,520
to that end our research questions are

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,720
what are survivors privacy and security

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,799
concerns

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
regarding trusting online third party

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
reporting systems

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
we also sought to address what could

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,080
help participate and trust

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,199
online reporting but trust online third

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,440
party reporting systems

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
to address our research questions we

157
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,560
recruited participants through word of

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
mouth

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
through recruitment notices at sexual

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,720
assault centers

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,600
and through snowball sampling

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
recruited survivors and support workers

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
who define support workers as anyone

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,479
that provides

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,479
some form of support to survivors and

166
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,599
this could include counsellors

167
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,280
nurses police officers and we also give

168
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
our participants the option of either an

169
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,960
interview or for coach group

170
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,360
want a participant to feel completely

171
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,080
uncomfortable and use whatever option

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,800
they wanted to participate in the study

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,560
we recruited a total of 35 participants

174
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,560
we stopped recruiting people when we

175
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,960
realized that we had to reach saturation

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
so we go to our findings our findings

177
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,680
can broadly be divided into two

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
technological concerns we regard with

179
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,120
regard to trusting online third party

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,198
reporting systems

181
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,039
we define technological concerns as

182
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,240
issues that participants had

183
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,360
with the use of technology

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,319
we also found emotional consent for

185
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,560
trusting and using an otprs system

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
we define emotional concerns as

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,479
psychological issues

188
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,639
that participants found with using and

189
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
trusting an otprs system

190
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
we also discovered that some

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,679
technological concerns led to emotional

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,840
concerns and vice versa

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
and we'll discuss some of them in this

194
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,479
presentation

195
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
example we found the technological

196
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,800
concern

197
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,280
of the insecurity of technology

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
for example ph who is also a survivor

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,638
said

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,318
she has zero confidence in online

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
because she doesn't know an online

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
system

203
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,160
as a hacker would this concern

204
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,880
led to the emotional concern of

205
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,639
re-victimization of the survivor

206
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,599
for example p16 who is a survivor said

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
servers get hacked all the time and your

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,280
sexual assault information that is

209
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
online could get into the wrong hand

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,159
and this could lead to a revitalization

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
of the survivor

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,759
we also had the technological concern of

213
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,479
the traceability of online reporting

214
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,759
for p16 she said that even if you

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
download and delete an

216
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
app or even if you installed and

217
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,758
uninstalled an app

218
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,759
there will always be trills and that can

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
be traced back to you

220
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
this is contrary to a paper-based

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
third-party reporting system

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,840
whereby the survivor just has to locate

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
a center

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,560
and walk into the center and there's no

225
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,000
necessarily any trolls

226
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
that that action was ever done

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,958
this technological concern led to the

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,039
emotional concern

229
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,399
of the fear the perpetrators could see

230
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
the otprs system

231
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,000
for example p22 who is a support worker

232
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,680
and who knows the person that sexually

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
assaulted her

234
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
and also thought the person regularly

235
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
said that she was worried that there

236
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,120
could be some kind of revenge

237
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
if the person ever found out that she

238
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,760
was using an otprs system

239
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,680
there was also the possibility of forced

240
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,920
reporting

241
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
for example p1 who is also a police

242
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,959
officer

243
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,399
felt that people could joke around or

244
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,119
even as a prank

245
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
submit multiple reports online and all

246
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,839
of this report would be recorded in the

247
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
police data bank

248
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,279
furthermore there was the emotional

249
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,640
concern of the lack of human support

250
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,760
p26 who was a support worker said

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,680
that for her it may be hard for um the

252
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,319
system since there is no human in the

253
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
loop

254
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
there is no way of determining if the

255
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
person reporting is in the right mental

256
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
state

257
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,399
to make that report this concern could

258
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,640
lead to

259
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,720
another emotional concern of the

260
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,480
victimization of the survivor

261
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,600
whereby the survivor is documenting

262
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,440
their emotions rather than the incident

263
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
and whatever the survivor uses on that

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
app or put in that app

265
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,320
could be used against the survivor in

266
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,719
the code of law

267
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,000
we invite you to please visit the paper

268
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,839
in order to see more of the findings

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,279
we jump now into the implications of our

270
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,279
findings

271
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,160
in order for survivors and police to

272
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,000
trust and use the otpera system

273
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,079
realize that we need to balance the

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,920
needs of both stakeholders

275
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
in order to understand these needs

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
better

277
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
we define privacy as knowing the

278
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,160
identity of a person

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,040
for not knowing their actions we define

280
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,560
anonymity as knowing a person's actions

281
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,560
but not knowing their identity

282
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
survivors wanted complete privacy and

283
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,399
anonymity

284
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,959
when making use of an online third-party

285
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,040
reporting system

286
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,920
the police on the other hand wanted no

287
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,920
privacy and no anonymity

288
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,519
there is therefore a tension between the

289
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,199
survivors and the police

290
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
whereby survivors want complete

291
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,920
anonymity and privacy

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,000
and the police want none in enough for

293
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,479
these two major stakeholders to use and

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,160
to trust an otprs system

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,800
there has to be a balance in this needs

296
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
we do not discuss design recommendations

297
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
because we realize that multiple

298
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
stakeholders need to be satisfied for an

299
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,880
autopia assistant to be trusted

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,560
however we discussed challenges and some

301
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,439
other challenges that were discovered

302
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,040
was

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
there were challenges that need to be

304
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,319
addressed before sending the otprs form

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,040
to the police

306
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,959
for example survivors have to trust that

307
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,680
no unauthorized person

308
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,518
will ever know that a survivor is using

309
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,199
or has ever used an otprs system

310
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,000
one implication of this challenge for

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,920
example is a multi-parent system has to

312
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,160
be designed in such a way that it is not

313
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,000
obvious

314
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
but then survivors could be filling out

315
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
an otprs phone

316
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
and forget to close the form and so

317
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,920
therefore that system becomes obvious

318
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,560
another challenge could be that since

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,800
phones automatically save history

320
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
then there could always be a troll that

321
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
can be traced back to the survivor

322
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,719
that the survivor has used a multiplayer

323
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,319
system

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
there are also challenges that still

325
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,880
need to be addressed

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,440
after the survivor sends the otps form

327
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,000
to the police

328
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
even after the fall has been sent the

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,040
system still needs to protect survivors

330
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,240
privacy

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,480
and anonymity

332
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
the police need to trust the ot paris

333
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
report

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
the police need to know that this report

335
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,360
came from survivors

336
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,319
and not somebody trying to play a prank

337
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,560
or someone trying to joke around

338
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,480
and so therefore the use of autocratic

339
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,279
system could lead to an increase in

340
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,279
force reporting

341
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,560
there's also the problem of lack of

342
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,959
human support

343
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,479
whereby um survivors there's no one

344
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,199
there to be able to know or to be able

345
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
to

346
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,560
find out if survivors are in the right

347
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,320
mental state

348
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,199
to make that report the key takeaways of

349
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
our findings are

350
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,800
otprs system can help increase the

351
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,079
reporting of sexual assault

352
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
however privacy anonymity and security

353
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
concerns

354
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,719
need to be addressed in order for

355
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,880
survivors and police

356
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,440
to trust and to use otprs system

357
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,680
the ultimate goal of our research is

358
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
that hci innovative tools can be

359
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,439
designed

360
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,719
with all of this in mind to be able to

361
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
provide a way

362
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
for survivors to get healing and justice

363
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
we really hope that this research could

364
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,000
start a form of discuss

365
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
in the research community on how this

366
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,519
can be achieved

367
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,839
