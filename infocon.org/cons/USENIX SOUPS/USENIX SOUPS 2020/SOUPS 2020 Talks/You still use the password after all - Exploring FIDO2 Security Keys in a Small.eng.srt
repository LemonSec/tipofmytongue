00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,399
hi everyone

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
i'm florian in our paper we explored the

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
use of finder 2 security keys

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
in a work environment as you all know

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,160
passwords are still the most common

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,960
method for user authentication on the

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,119
web

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,000
but passwords have many weaknesses for

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,680
example they can't be dashed

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,198
online identities are often only

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
protected by passwords

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,680
so phishing is a suitable tool to steal

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,640
identities and companies are lucrative

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
targets

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
using two-factor authentication can help

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
to counter phishing attacks

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,718
however the underlying problem that

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
passwords can easily be stones their

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,680
remains

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,199
so this is where fighter 2 came into

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
play finder 2

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
is a set of standards specifying

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,160
protocols for user authentication on the

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
web

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,078
until now fighter 2 is most often used

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,760
for defector authentication

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,680
but it can also be used for single

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
factor authentication so called

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
passwordless authentication finder two

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
authenticators stop public key

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
credentials

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
bound to a specific domain name so they

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,560
can't be fished

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
for our study we implemented pacifist

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
authentication with security

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
keys instead of entering a username and

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
password

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,479
the security key could be used for

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
authentication

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
however we required user verification on

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
the security key

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,758
so one still have to enter some pin to

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
unlock the key

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,280
we integrated file the two-based

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
authentication into a web application of

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
a small company that developed software

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,280
for the life science sector

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
replication was used by the company's

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
employees and customers

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
the new authentication method was

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,479
completely optional so

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
participants could choose whether their

53
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,600
user keep security key or not

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
we recruited eight employees to explore

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,399
whether security keys are suitable

56
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,640
to replace passwords the participants

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,280
had different positions and jobs in the

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
company including salespersons software

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,640
developers

60
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,398
project and the content managers first

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
we conducted a workshop where we taught

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
the participants how to use the security

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
key and encourage them to use them

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
in their daily routine after the

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
workshop

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,599
we let them use a security key for four

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
weeks

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,799
we collected data via authentication

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,519
diaries

70
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,879
and server locks finally after about

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
four weeks we interviewed

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,000
the participants to learn about their

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,840
experience with the security key

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
the interviews showed that most

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,640
participants believed that the security

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
key was more secure than passwords

77
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,079
when we asked them why the key is more

78
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
secure

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
five participants pointed out that you

80
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
must have the key

81
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,679
others said that no password is sent

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,680
over the network so no one can steal it

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
also the pin was mentioned as a second

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
factor

85
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,440
some participants found this extra level

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,959
of security are necessary for their

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
online activities

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
they stated that passwords are secure

89
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,399
enough

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,319
but they indicated that for specific

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
scenarios like in online banking a

92
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,760
higher level of security can

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
make sense we identified some adoption

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,840
barriers mentioned across

95
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,760
the interviews for example participants

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,319
raised concerns about being locked out

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,480
by losing or forgetting the security key

98
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
these concerns were only hypothetical in

99
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,319
our setting because participants could

100
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,958
always fall back to using

101
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,720
the username and password not being used

102
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
to the security keys

103
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
also had an impact on using this key or

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
not

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
due to the routine in using passwords

106
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,798
two participants reported that they

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
simply forgot to use the key this

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
problem was probably

109
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,840
made even worse because participants

110
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
used the key only for one web

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,959
application

112
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
for all their other logins they still

113
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,879
used passwords

114
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,120
we analyzed the authentication timings

115
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,359
extracted from our server logs

116
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,879
we compared the timings of the different

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
authentication types

118
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,640
the security key was smaller than

119
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,519
password-based authentication

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,439
especially using the autofill feature in

121
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,159
browsers was faster than the security

122
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,480
key

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,319
we assume that the new and more complex

124
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
workflow of the security key

125
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
caused most of the difference in the

126
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,079
timings this need to be further

127
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,238
investigated in future studies

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,478
we think the authentication timings are

129
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,120
critical for acceptance of the new

130
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,199
authentication method

131
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
if you have any questions feel free to

132
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
contact me or ask me

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:41,280
in the q a at subs 2020

134
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:41,280
thank you for your attention
