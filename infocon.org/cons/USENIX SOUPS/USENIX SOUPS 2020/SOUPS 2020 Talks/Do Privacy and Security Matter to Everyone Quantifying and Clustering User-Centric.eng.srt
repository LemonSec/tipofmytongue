hi

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
everyone thank you so much for watching

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,920
this short video talk about our paper

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,678
titled

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
do privacy and security matter to

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
everyone quantifying and clustering

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,599
user-centric considerations about smart

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,160
home device adoption

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
i'm nata barboza and i'm a phd candidate

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
at the university of illinois urbana

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,560
champaign

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,959
and here i also speak for my co-authors

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,399
jo hao zhang and yang wang

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,559
the motivation for our research

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,360
primarily came from seeing a lot of

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,480
concerns

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,719
uh in in smart home device adoption

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,398
with regard to privacy and security

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
there is media reports

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
and there is consumer reports constantly

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,919
showing how

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
consumers are concerned about what the

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
devices are doing

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,600
yet year over year adoption continues to

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,760
grow looking at this we wondered

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
what's going on is this a paradox that's

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
taking place for example do people say

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
they are concerned about privacy and

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,280
security and then their behavior should

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,519
suggest

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,439
otherwise or is there more nuance to

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
their privacy decision making

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,798
in order to study this we conducted an

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
online survey

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,520
with 631 u.s based participants on

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
amazon mechanical turk

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
in this survey we asked participants to

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
tell us what could motivate them to

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
purchase our own products

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
similarly we also asked them what could

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,880
keep them from adopting smart home

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
devices

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,439
in our analysis we found that the top

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,199
motivators for people to consider

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,720
buying smart home devices are

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
convenience ease of use

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,158
price cost saving and need in a similar

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,839
analysis

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,759
for factors that could prevent people

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
from adopting we found that the top

51
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,600
blockers are private

52
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,720
price privacy security ease of use and

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,798
reliability

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
these are things that participants claim

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,759
would prevent them from adopting smart

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
home devices

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
and on the y-axis on the chart you see

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,199
the percentage of participants who

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
mentioned each of those factors as

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
blockers

61
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
we further conducted a consumer

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,200
segmentation analysis

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
where three clusters emerged the first

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
cluster was the affordability oriented

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
cluster

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
and this was composed by participants

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,479
who mentioned that they would not

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,879
purchase a device

69
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,879
if it was too expensive for example the

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,519
second cluster was the privacy-oriented

71
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
cluster

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
and in this cluster it was common to see

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
participant responses mentioning that

74
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
they were afraid of monitoring or

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
secondary use of their data collected

76
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,200
inside their homes

77
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
finally the third cluster was the

78
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
reliability oriented cluster

79
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
and in this cluster participants

80
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
responses indicated things such as

81
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
what would happen if the internet went

82
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,359
down with the device to work

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,280
and things like that the clusters we

84
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
identified were largely defined by the

85
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,040
blockers that people responded in the

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,760
survey

87
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
finally from this clustering analysis we

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,079
attempted to reconstruct the

89
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,040
decision-making

90
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
process of our participants by training

91
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,079
a decision

92
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
tree classifier in order to predict the

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
cluster that each participant would

94
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,560
belong in

95
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
and we created a decision tree with the

96
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
fewest number of factors and this

97
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,959
tree was composed by privacy

98
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,119
blocker and price blocker and motivator

99
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,800
and the way to interpret this and this

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
is the main takeaway from this tree

101
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
is that a consumer may initially not

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
choose to adopt a specific smart home

103
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
device because

104
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,399
they cannot afford it or they think it's

105
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,079
too expensive and this consumer is also

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
concerned about their privacy

107
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,599
yet if at some point they have a price

108
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,760
incentive to adopt

109
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,319
they might even consider adopting that

110
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,159
device and you would see here that how

111
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,000
if price becomes a motivator at some

112
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,440
point for example through promotions or

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
device giveaways

114
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,239
this consumer who would likewise who

115
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
would otherwise be privacy oriented

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
becomes affordability oriented and this

117
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,040
is the takeaway from this decision tree

118
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,959
from this analysis and other analysis

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
that i briefly presented we drew some

120
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
recommendations for developers and

121
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,839
policy makers

122
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
for developers we recommend that they

123
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
highlight priorities

124
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
for example highlight for a specific

125
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
device what was the priority for that

126
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
device was it a low cost was it to

127
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,238
preserve privacy or was it to make the

128
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
device reliable

129
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,360
this will help consumers find the right

130
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,079
device device for them

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
and meet them where they are we also

132
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
recommend surfacing trade-offs for

133
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
example

134
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,320
if a camera is to have an offline mode

135
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,320
for privacy reasons

136
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
object detection may not work well when

137
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
offline if it's

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,759
rely rely on the cloud to do that this

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
may affect reliability

140
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,919
uh similarly if you were to implement

141
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
this object recognition capability into

142
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,359
the camera so that it can work offline

143
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,880
it may make the device more expensive

144
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
for policy makers most of our

145
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,240
recommendations focus on mitigating

146
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,919
bounded rationality

147
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
which is the idea that consumers are

148
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
making decisions based on the

149
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
information available to them at the

150
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,479
time of the decision

151
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
for example policy makers could require

152
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,359
developers to communicate if a device is

153
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,679
cheaper or free

154
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
but potentially privacy invasive if it's

155
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,120
more expensive but also more reliable

156
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,198
and ultimately educating consumers

157
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
when the smart alternative is cheaper or

158
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
free for example is it free but

159
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
introduces internet connection

160
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,840
thank you so much feel free to check out
