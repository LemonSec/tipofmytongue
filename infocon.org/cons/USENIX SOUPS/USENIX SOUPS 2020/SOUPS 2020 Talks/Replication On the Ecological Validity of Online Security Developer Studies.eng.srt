hi

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
i'm anastasia danilova from the

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,080
university of bonn

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,519
and i will give you some insights of our

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,359
replication study

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,680
on the ecological validity of online

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
security developer studies exploring

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,320
deception

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
in a password storage study with

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
freelancers

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
nayakshanidol conducted a password

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,759
storage study with freelancers

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
and the participants were asked to

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,239
complete the user registration

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,640
functionality

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,519
of a university social networking

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,120
platform

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
the study was not announced as an

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,440
academic study but as a real project

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,599
the offers used a deception study design

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,800
where freelance developers were hired

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
for a regular job

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,078
using a company front created for the

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
study

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
instead of openly telling the

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,519
freelancers that they were taking part

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
in a study

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,760
therefore we wanted to examine deception

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
in this particular study context

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,640
to do so we announced the project as an

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
academic study

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
we had the following study design

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
changes first

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,039
recruitment in the original study the

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,200
researchers selected the participants

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
while in our replication study the

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,159
freelancers applied for the project

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
second study announcement in the

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
original study the study was not

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
announced as an academic study

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
while in this replication it was

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,039
announced as an academic project

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,039
further in the original study only jsf

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
was investigated as a framework

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,360
while in this replication study we also

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,479
investigated spring

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,799
the jsf offers

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
participants to implement a password

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
storage on their own

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,200
in contrast spring offers supporting

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
libraries

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,479
we extended this replication with one

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,320
additional

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
security request after the first

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,398
submission where we asked the

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,040
freelancers with less than six point

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,399
on the security score to store the

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
passwords by following

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,840
industry's best practice finally

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,038
our payment method resembled prior

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
freelancer study

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,319
but was split into compensation

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
milestones

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,560
since we included up to three possible

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,640
iterations of the code review

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
and possible security requests we

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,279
divided the payment process

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
based on three milestones in total the

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,480
participants received the same amount of

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,879
money as in their original study

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,760
apart from that we investigated the same

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
dependent and

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,679
independent variables as nayakshin idol

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,238
so we considered the

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
independent variable prompting which

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
means one group was explicitly asked

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,920
to store the password securely while the

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,560
other group was not

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,119
let's discuss our results shortly we

80
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,800
conducted our replication study with

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,440
43 freelance developers from

82
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,599
freelancers.com

83
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,359
our code submissions were coded with the

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,518
security scale

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
the majority of non-prompt participants

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,040
submitted a non-secure solution

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,200
16 out of 21 only five participants

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,079
considered security

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
of the 22 prompted participants 15 at

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,959
least hashed the passwords

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,359
so similarly to niaginal studies we

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,200
found

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,840
the effect of prompted to be significant

94
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,119
our results suggest that freelancers are

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
a useful sample

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,799
for usable security developer studies

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,159
using the same

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,720
sample size and the same study protocol

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,519
minus the study deception we got similar

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,560
results to naiakshi nairo

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,560
we got similar effect sizes directions

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
and statistically significant results

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,920
for the same tests as they did

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,319
and did not get any that they did not

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
in both studies prompting led to more

106
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,280
security

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,480
the impact was significant in both

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
samples

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,280
we conclude for this study that the

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,279
removal of deception element

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,799
in the study context does not seem to

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
have changed any

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
outcomes and all relevant results gained

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,359
from the original study with deception

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,239
have also been gathered without

116
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
since deception should only be used when

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,519
necessary

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
for this study we would not recommend to

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
use it again

120
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,359
in this specific context however our

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,280
study presents only one data point

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
and further research is needed on the

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,280
use of deception

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
in other studies covering our security

125
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,119
issues

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
tasks and scenarios as well as with our

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
types

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,679
of developers thank you very much for

129
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,840
your intention

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,840
and we are happy to answer any of your

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
questions

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
you
