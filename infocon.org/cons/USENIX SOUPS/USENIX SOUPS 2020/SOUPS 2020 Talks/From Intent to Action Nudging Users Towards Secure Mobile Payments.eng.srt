1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,280
hello

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,719
i'm peter's story and today i'll be

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,200
summarizing our paper

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,240
from intent to action nudging users

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,759
towards secure mobile payments

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,279
it's well known that there's a gap

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
between the advice of privacy and

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,000
security experts

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,840
and what most people actually do in our

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,920
study we focused on the low adoption of

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,519
secure mobile payments in the u.s

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,520
despite the prevalence of credit and

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440
debit card fraud

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
mobile payment systems like apple pay

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
employ stronger security protections

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,399
than physical cards

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
if they have relatively low adoption

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
here so we investigated two

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,280
interventions with the potential to

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
increase adoption

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,559
we chose to study nudging interventions

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
nudges are designed to help people act

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
as they say they want to

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,920
helping people to overcome their own

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,600
cognitive and behavioral biases

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
our first nudge was based on protection

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,680
motivation theory and our second nudge

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,679
was based on implementation intentions

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,360
production motivation theory suggests

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,439
that people's motivation to act

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
is based on their perceptions of threat

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,839
susceptibility

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,479
threat severity response efficacy and

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
self-efficacy we address these four

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,560
points with different pieces of relevant

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,158
information

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
a person's perception of threat

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
susceptibility is how likely they think

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,840
they are to be personally affected by a

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
threat

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,479
and we address this by describing recent

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,799
cases of card information theft

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,640
like the target hack the home depot hack

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,640
and the recent saks fifth avenue hack

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,479
threat severity is a measure of how

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
serious a person thinks it would be

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
if they were in fact affected by the

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,559
threat we address threat severity by

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,839
describing the consequences of card

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
fraud for individuals

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,159
a person's perception of response

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,600
advocacy is their belief that the

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
response they can take

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,079
will be an effective protection in this

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
case whether using mobile payments will

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,038
actually protect them from the threat of

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
card fraud

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,000
we addressed threat or response efficacy

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
by describing the security protections

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
that are

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
offered by mobile payments

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,239
and finally self-efficacy is your belief

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
that you'll be able to perform the

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,760
response

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
that is to use mobile payments we

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,239
address self-advocacy by describing the

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
availability of mobile payments

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,040
and we included text and video

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
instructions for using them

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,840
our second nudge was based on

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,319
implementation intentions

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
an implementation intention is a

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,359
concrete

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,239
contextually activated plan to achieve a

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
goal

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
in this case the goal being to stay safe

77
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,640
from card fraud

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
literature suggests implementation

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,359
intentions

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,440
are especially well suited to helping

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
people remember to take an action

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
such as remembering to make a secure

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,159
mobile payment

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,238
instead of paying with their usual

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,079
physical card

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
in our study we presented participants

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,959
with a planned template

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,239
to help them form their own

89
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
implementation intention

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,559
we first reassured participants it was

91
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,560
optional to fill out the plan

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,720
we next encourage participants to list

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
up to three stores or restaurants

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,239
without they were likely to have the

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,959
opportunity to make a model payment in

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
the coming week

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
then participants completed a mental

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,640
rehearsal activity

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,640
where they pictured themselves making

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,879
mobile payments at each location they

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
listed

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,560
and finally we gave participants the

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,559
opportunity to commit to their plan

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,798
we started these nudges with a mixed

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
methods design

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,840
we first conducted a series of

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
longitudinal interviews with 20

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
participants

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
and these interviews helped us identify

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,200
common misconceptions

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,280
and refine the design of our nudges we

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,958
next conducted a longitudinal between

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,799
subject's field experiment

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,560
this time with 411 participants

115
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
also note that we finished collecting

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
data in late 2019

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,839
so that's before there was widespread

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
awareness of the coronavirus in the u.s

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,959
for interviews we recruited people who

120
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
had recently made a card-based payment

121
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,960
and would not recently use mobile

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
payments but who had phones compatible

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,520
with either apple pay

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,599
google pay or samsung pay

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,280
in our first semi-structured interview

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
we asked participants about their prior

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,599
experiences with card fraud

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,440
then we exposed all participants to both

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
the protection motivation theory

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
and implementation intentions based

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
nudges

132
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
a week after completing the interview we

133
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
sent participants a survey

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,720
we asked them whether they'd set up a

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,080
mobile payment system on their phone

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
or whether they'd used it to make a

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,520
purchase

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,360
if they had set up a mobile payment

139
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
system they then invited them to a

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
follow-up interview

141
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
and in this interview we asked about

142
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,240
their experiences using mobile payments

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,239
or their reasons for not using them and

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,520
finally four weeks after completing the

145
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
first follow-up survey

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,120
we sent a second follow-up survey to

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
anyone who had set up

148
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
a mobile payment on their phone and we

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
asked whether they'd recently made a

150
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
mobile payment

151
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
so none of the people we recruited for

152
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,320
our interview had used mobile payments

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,719
in stores in the past month

154
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,960
but we found that nearly all had heard

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,000
of either apple pay google pay

156
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,320
or samsung pay before our study they

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,280
reported saying mobile payments and ads

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,800
on their phones as payment options

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,679
knowing friends or family who use the

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
systems

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
or having personally used the systems

162
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,198
for digital purchases

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
so it seems unlikely that the low

164
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,199
adoption of mobile payments in the us

165
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,680
is solely due to lack of awareness

166
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,600
participants described several positive

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
aspects of mobile payments

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,759
such as them being easy to use removing

169
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,199
the need for using cards and for their

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
wallet

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
mobile payments being a good backup

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,440
option and mobile payments

173
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
being fun to use now our most

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
enthusiastic participant

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,199
said they hadn't voluntarily used their

176
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
cards since starting to use apple pay

177
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,840
and that it was their new default

178
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
payment method

179
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,479
however as we introduced mobile payments

180
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
to participants and they tried to use

181
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
them

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,840
a number of obstacles also arose

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,599
two participants were confused by the

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
setup process for apple pay

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
where it gives you the option to scan

186
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,359
your card to automatically fill in the

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,759
details

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,440
other challenges included people's cards

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
not being supported

190
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
having to interact with one's bank to

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
approve the addition of the card to

192
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,440
apple pay sometimes this means you have

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
to call the bank

194
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,039
not having opportunities to use mobile

195
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,039
payments

196
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,360
mobile payments not being accepted in

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,440
some stores

198
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
not remembering to use mobile payments

199
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
and then simply having difficulty using

200
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,239
them

201
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,758
so i'll give more detail about usability

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
challenges on the next slide

203
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,319
four of our participants who set up

204
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,919
apple pay described

205
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,800
accidentally activating it on their

206
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,080
phones and this accidental activation

207
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
alarmed at least one of our participants

208
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,719
they wondered where their card

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,799
information was being sent when

210
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
activated

211
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,160
the credit thing keeps popping up

212
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
whenever an angle my phone a certain

213
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
direction

214
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,680
i wonder where it's sending my credit

215
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,680
info each time

216
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
so it's possible to open apple pay by

217
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,199
either double clicking the home button

218
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,520
when the phone's locked

219
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
or by bringing the phone in proximity to

220
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,878
an nfc

221
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
reader even if that near field

222
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,960
communication reader

223
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,799
isn't a payment terminal so we address

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,799
this confusion to some extent

225
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,479
by describing that double clicking to

226
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
activate functionality

227
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
in the apple pay usage instructions in

228
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,520
both our subsequent interviews

229
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,199
and in our experiment now one of these

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,639
same participants encountered another

231
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,160
usability challenge

232
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,319
and that's the failure of apple pay to

233
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,919
activate at one location this

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
participant reported having to scan

235
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,680
their phone twice before it worked

236
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,440
and at another location they were

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
frustrated because they weren't able to

238
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,840
use apple pay

239
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,198
and they concluded that it must not have

240
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
been supported because it didn't

241
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
activate

242
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,878
what happens when it doesn't work is

243
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,479
that nothing happens

244
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
it just sits there and it doesn't even

245
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,799
apologize you know it doesn't say

246
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,319
anything on it oops sorry try again

247
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,319
nothing like that so due to the lack of

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
a signal from the payment terminal

249
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
when the terminal doesn't support mobile

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
payments there might not

251
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
actually be a technical solution to this

252
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,399
failure mode

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
we give all participants the opportunity

254
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,320
to form an implementation intention plan

255
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,880
to use mobile payments and 16 did

256
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
describe

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,480
at least one location where they might

258
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,240
use mobile payments in the week ahead

259
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
so forming plans seem to help four

260
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
participants identify places that it

261
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
could be difficult to make mobile

262
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,800
payments

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,880
for example it might be difficult to

264
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,719
make a mobile payment at a restaurant

265
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,320
if they collect your card bring it to

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,920
the back room and swipe it themselves

267
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
or it could be difficult to use mobile

268
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,040
payments at gas stations

269
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,040
because here in the us many have been

270
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
slow to upgrade from mag stripe readers

271
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,560
a number of different misconceptions

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,640
came up in our interviews

273
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,079
we had participants wonder whether

274
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,600
mobile payments would interfere with

275
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
their card rewards

276
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,480
whether we're being paid by apple pay or

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,880
by apple to promote apple pay

278
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,600
we had participants wonder if mobile

279
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,839
payments cost something to use

280
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,240
we also had participants conflate apple

281
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
pay with ipad based point of sale

282
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,320
terminals

283
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,600
like the square payment system

284
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,519
not realizing that those are from a

285
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
different company

286
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
and we had a participant wonder whether

287
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,720
mobile payments would

288
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,839
completely eliminate receipts

289
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
so we addressed some of these

290
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
misconceptions in our faq that we

291
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,399
included in our experiment

292
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,600
we addressed uh questions like is apple

293
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
pay free

294
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,760
while i still earn card rewards can i

295
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
add multiple cards

296
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,480
how can i be sure apple pay is safe and

297
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
we refuted the notion that we're being

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,720
paid

299
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
by apple to promote apple pay

300
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
so about a third of the participants in

301
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
the

302
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
interview section of our study made a

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
mobile payment at least

304
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,160
once and none of these people had used

305
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
mobile payments before

306
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,880
in physical locations that is so this

307
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,560
suggests that our nudges did influence

308
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
participants behavior

309
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,239
but we needed a controlled experiment to

310
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,560
be able to reliably measure

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,760
whether there was an effect and its size

312
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
so that's what we did next

313
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
we ran our experiment on the prolific

314
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,560
crowdsourcing platform

315
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,240
we chose to focus on apple pay we

316
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,439
recruited people who'd recently made a

317
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
card-based payment

318
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
and who had not recently used apple pay

319
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,040
through had phones compatible with apple

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
pay

321
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
we had three treatment conditions a

322
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
group that saw

323
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,160
only the protection motivation theory

324
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,719
based nudge a group which saw

325
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
that and the implementation intentions

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
based notch

327
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,240
and the control group that saw neither

328
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
nudge so we didn't test implementation

329
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
intentions alone

330
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,800
because the literature suggests that

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,360
implementation intentions will not be

332
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
effective if people are not motivated

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,040
and the idea is that the protection

334
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
motivation theory now should provide

335
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,760
that motivation

336
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,440
now after a week we followed up we asked

337
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,680
participants in another survey

338
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,279
whether they'd actually used apple pay

339
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,279
in since the previous survey

340
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
so we found that our treatments did make

341
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
participants more likely to use apple

342
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,359
pay

343
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,600
we found a large difference between our

344
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,000
pmt plus implementation intention

345
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,399
treatment

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,920
in the control group and then a medium

347
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
difference between the pmt-only

348
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
treatment in the control group

349
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,320
and both these differences were

350
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,639
statistically significant

351
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,959
the difference between the pmt only and

352
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,600
the pmt plus implementation intentions

353
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,199
treatment

354
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,200
was not statistically significant

355
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
so our treatments also made participants

356
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
more likely to agree

357
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,720
that apple pay would protect them from

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,920
card fraud as shown in the graph here

359
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,399
the control group we had only 37 agree

360
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,800
that apple pay would protect them

361
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
whereas in both treatment groups over 84

362
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
agreed

363
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,279
so participants initial skepticism of

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
apple pay security

365
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,439
is actually consistent with prior work

366
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,279
and the findings from our interviews

367
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,200
so in our interview some participants

368
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,519
were concerned that apple google

369
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,120
or their phones might be hacked and even

370
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
though such hacks are theoretically

371
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
possible

372
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,279
it's our position that they require

373
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,160
substantially more resources from

374
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,079
attackers

375
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,040
making them less realistic and less a

376
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,040
threat to end users

377
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
we also found that those in our

378
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,360
treatment groups expressed greater

379
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,599
intentions to use apple pay in the week

380
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,079
ahead

381
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
now those in particular those in our

382
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,199
implementation

383
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
intention treatment expressed even

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,920
greater intentions

385
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
than those in the pmt only group

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,079
however we observe that in many cases

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,079
intention to use apple pay

388
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
didn't translate into actual use of

389
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,000
apple pay

390
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,479
so more than half of those who expressed

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,959
a strong intention to use apple pay

392
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,279
did so but those with weaker intentions

393
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
were much less likely to use apple pay

394
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,120
and this shows the importance of asking

395
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,320
participants about both their intentions

396
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
and their actual behavior

397
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
we found that participants who set up

398
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,199
apple pay during our study

399
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
they mostly did so between the survey

400
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,279
with our intervention

401
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
and the follow-up survey a week later

402
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,120
maybe people wanted more time to think

403
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
before setting up apple pay

404
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
this shows the importance of using a

405
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,279
longitudinal design to measure people's

406
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,800
behavior in the real world

407
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,040
it's also interesting that more than a

408
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
third of participants had already set up

409
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,319
apple pay

410
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,000
but hadn't used it recently these

411
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,279
participants might benefit the most from

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
nudging interventions

413
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,279
since for them there's one last thing

414
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,839
getting in the way of them using them

415
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,439
in conclusion we designed nudges to

416
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
correct people's misconceptions about

417
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
mobile payments

418
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,399
and help them make plans to use them and

419
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
both our treatments increase

420
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,880
real-world adoption of apple pay

421
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,079
shrinking the gap between experts advice

422
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,680
and user's behavior mentors like ours

423
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
may help increase adoption of other

424
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,359
tools and other best practices

425
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
so we hope that our work will inspire

426
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,040
future exploration of this

427
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,399
design space thanks so much for watching

please get in touch if you have any

429
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
questions or thoughts thank you for your
