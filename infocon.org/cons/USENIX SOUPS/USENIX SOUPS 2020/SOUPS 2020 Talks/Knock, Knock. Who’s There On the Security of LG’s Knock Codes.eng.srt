00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,360
hi everyone

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,880
my name is reina samuel today my

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,559
colleagues and i would like to talk to

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
you about lg's knock codes and its

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
usability and security

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,400
before i begin i'd like to thank my

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,680
co-authors phillip markert

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,840
from rural university bullhorn adam aviv

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
from the george washington university

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,599
and my advisor julian niemtu for their

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,439
hard work

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
and support that made this study

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
possible

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,520
in order to protect our devices we

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
usually use some form of authentication

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079
that we feel

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,199
is comfortable and secure you might be

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,440
using a pin or if you're an android user

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,600
you might be using a pattern

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,879
these are examples of knowledge based

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
methods

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,800
meaning that the user has to demonstrate

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,879
some kind of knowledge

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,919
of the pin or pattern in order to

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,158
authenticate or unlock their device

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,159
even if you use a biometric method such

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
as fingerprint or face id

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
you would still need to use a knowledge

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,040
based system as well as a backup

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,600
to this while you may be used to these

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
methods

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,798
there are new ways to unlock your phone

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
such as

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
lg's knock codes

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,439
introduced in 2014 knockouts require

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
users to select a series of six to 10

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
knocks or

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920
taps on a 2x2 grid this pattern is the

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
code

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
that users would recall in order to

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,720
access their device

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
these codes can be used with the screen

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,280
off

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,000
or on

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,439
based on lg users we estimate that there

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
are 700 000

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,320
to 2.5 million potential knock code

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,640
users in the us alone

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,398
as knock codes have a user base and it

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
is another form of knowledge based

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
authentication

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
it's important to consider the following

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,040
how secure

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
and usable are knob codes

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,200
our study aims to answer this we ended

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,598
up discovering that

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
knock codes offer less security compared

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,040
to other authentication methods

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
and that participants find now codes

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,239
mostly unusable and insecure in our

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
studies

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
however when you use knock codes with a

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,280
block list which prevents users

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,920
from using a common code the security of

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,480
now codes is vastly improved

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,399
overall participants found knock codes

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,840
interesting and seemed intrigued

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
by new methods of mobile authentication

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,319
to evaluate the security and usability

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,800
of knock codes we conducted two

71
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,518
online user studies on amazon mechanical

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
turk

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,760
a crowdsourcing website where subjects

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
can be recruited for surveys or user

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,480
studies

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,000
we began with a preliminary study with

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,760
218 participants that took place on a

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
desktop browser

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
this study allowed us to refine our main

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,280
study and develop a block list of the 30

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,200
most common knock codes

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,599
the main study had 351 participants

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,399
and was a mobile only study with three

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,879
treatments

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
a control a block list and a larger grid

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,159
size

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,280
users had to input and recall their

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
codes based on

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,599
certain scenarios and then had to answer

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,599
questions about the security and

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,798
usability of knock codes

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,440
each participant had to create two knock

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,440
codes

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
from which we retrieved 1138 different

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,200
knock codes

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,399
which were analyzed as we performed both

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,798
a security

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,799
and usability analysis on these results

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
we assigned participants to one of three

100
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,480
treatments

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,480
the first was a control which is the

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
standard grid size and implementation by

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,119
lg

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,040
a block list which is again the standard

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,280
grid size but prevented users from

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,319
inputting a common code

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
and the third is a large treatment we

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,280
used a larger grid size to potentially

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
improve

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,879
the security of knock codes we used a

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
2x3 grid

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,000
as it fit the form factor of most mobile

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,599
devices better

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
compared to other large treatments

115
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
we looked into the most common knowledge

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
based

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
authentication methods among

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,040
participants

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
four digit pins were the most popular

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,000
one followed by

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,239
android patterns however there were

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,479
users who did use knock codes

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
while three percent may seem small and

124
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,360
it is compared

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,560
to pins and patterns this is potentially

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,400
three percent of all smartphone users

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,720
when we adjusted for demographics within

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,440
the us we found out that there may be as

129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,840
many as

130
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
700 000 to 2.5 million users in the us

131
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,320
alone

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
this does not include standalone

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,039
applications that you can download from

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
google play

135
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,120
which allows you to have a knock code

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
regardless of having an lg device

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
before choosing a knock code

138
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,120
participants had the

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,960
opportunity to practice using knock

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,520
codes they were assigned

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
to two different scenarios where they

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
had to select a knock code for

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,000
protection

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,239
the first scenario was a device unlock

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
and the second varied between a shopping

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
cart

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,560
or a banking app different scenarios

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,840
help offer different security contexts

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,120
and were randomized participants were

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
prompted to provide

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
memorable codes as they had to recall

152
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,239
their selected codes at the end of the

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
survey

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,000
in the end regardless of the scenario

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000
there were no major differences found

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
we analyzed frequency statistics to

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
observe different characteristics when

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,880
choosing knock codes based on treatment

159
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,560
here we see the most common code in the

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,199
control dataset

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,960
and it starts in the upper left corner

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,319
as is seen in many codes across

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,239
treatments

164
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
this follows a left to right sequence

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,759
that we'd call an hourglass

166
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,680
shape the second most common code moves

167
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,120
in a clockwise manner or in a circle

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
shape

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,479
and the third most common code uses

170
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,479
double taps or

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,479
as we call a circle double tap shape

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,600
as we see here regarding block lists

173
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,000
double taps are used quite frequently

174
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,039
and possibly as a means of security

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,520
among participants

176
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,400
in the large treatment we see more

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,599
directional

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,080
patterns with less repetition as users

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,199
take advantage of the larger grid

180
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,280
however we will show that

181
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
more options actually didn't increase

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,479
the security

183
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,479
as the patterns used were less secure

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,719
we noticed with start frequencies and

185
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,599
knock codes that there is a strong

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,599
tendency

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,719
for codes to begin in the upper left

188
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,560
corner

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,639
this is probably due to the left to

190
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,560
right nature of the english language

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,400
since our participants were recruited in

192
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,080
the united states

193
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,159
the least common starting points were in

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,159
the lower right corner and in the larger

195
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
treatment the middle row was not used as

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,319
often

197
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,799
the end frequencies have much more

198
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,960
subtle differences between treatments

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
as there are more diverse ending

200
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,120
locations

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,960
used by participants

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
determining frequency statistics is

203
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,479
extremely helpful when developing our

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,520
threat models to predict and guess

205
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,520
possible knock codes

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,160
we used two threat models in our

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,160
security analysis

208
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
the first is a perfect knowledge

209
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
attacker

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,520
here the attacker knows and has the

211
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,878
complete knowledge of the frequency

212
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
order of knock codes

213
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,440
in the set of codes attempting to guess

214
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,680
making one guess at a time

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
in this case the attacker always guesses

216
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,360
the most frequent knock code

217
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
then the next frequent knock code and so

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,319
on until all codes are guests

219
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,199
this provides an upper bound on attack

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,759
performance

221
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,440
because the guess is always successful

222
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,960
as the attacker has complete knowledge

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,680
of the frequency of codes being guessed

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,719
however a simulated attacker must

225
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,479
attempt to guess

226
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,400
an unknown test set of knock codes based

227
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,639
on a known training set

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,840
we used a markov process to build a

229
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
model from the training

230
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,519
data to simulate a guessing attack on

231
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,439
the test set

232
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,919
without full knowledge of the test set

233
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,159
each guess may not be successful

234
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
that is matching none of the codes in

235
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,159
the test set

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,360
and thus this provides a more realistic

237
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,360
security estimation

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,160
with the perfect knowledge attacker we

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,959
used two guessability metrics

240
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,880
the first was an online model where the

241
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,920
attacker has a limited number

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
of attempts we use a beta success rate

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,479
that measures what fraction of codes

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,319
would be guessed

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
if the attackers only had a certain

246
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,760
number of beta guesses

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,600
we see here how we have a high success

248
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,720
rate for both the control

249
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,720
and large treatments in other words

250
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,279
more than half the codes are guessed

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
within just 30 attempts

252
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
and this is greatly decreased when we

253
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,000
use a block list

254
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
the second model we used was an offline

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,160
model where an attacker has

256
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
unlimited attempts we discuss the

257
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,079
partial guessing entropy

258
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
or alpha guesswork which estimates the

259
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
amount of work

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
needed to guess an alpha fraction of the

261
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
code

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
here we see block lists increase the

263
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
work

264
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:50,640
by 1.5 bits compared to other treatments

265
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,360
thus improving the security greatly

266
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
in the case of the simulated attacker we

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
see first

268
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,120
that initially the large treatment shows

269
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,240
some improvement compared to the control

270
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,519
up to the first five guesses then the

271
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
reverse occurs

272
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
and the large treatment shows no

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
improvement and actually worsens

274
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,439
security

275
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
comparing the control with the block

276
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
list we now see a significant

277
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,480
improvement

278
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
and with all three treatments it is

279
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,920
clear that overall block lists improve

280
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,920
the current deployment

281
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,680
while the large treatment offered little

282
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
to worse security

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,160
this is probably due to the fact that

284
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
large treatment provided a false sense

285
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,719
of security

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,439
with the variety of options to

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,440
participants

288
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,319
now we will look at usability starting

289
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,040
with entry time

290
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
or the time one takes when one unlocks

291
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,439
their phone

292
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,920
we see that knock codes are much

293
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
much slower than other standard methods

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,920
such as pins and patterns

295
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,920
seven seconds is terrible and twice as

296
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,800
slow as these methods

297
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,000
in addition of a block list it did not

298
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,599
affect the general entry

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
time compared to the other treatments

300
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
either

301
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,519
regarding recall rates the large

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,920
treatment had the best overall recall

303
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,800
rate

304
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,079
compared to the other treatments however

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
it's important to note

306
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,519
that nearly 1 one-eighth of participants

307
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,440
in the control

308
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,720
and one-fifth of participants in the

309
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,279
blockless treatments

310
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
forgot their codes in a small 10-minute

311
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
survey

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,319
which reflects a very poor recall rate

313
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
among knockouts

314
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
and while less than one-tenth of

315
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,160
participants in the large treatment

316
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,959
forgot their code

317
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,959
these were the least secure codes among

318
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,880
the entire study

319
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,000
additionally when comparing to other

320
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,640
methods

321
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,839
pins and patterns have recall rates of

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,959
95 percent

323
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,360
or higher overall

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,719
users perceived knock codes favorably

325
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,920
and found them to be

326
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,600
easy discrete hard to guess

327
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,880
different and quick

328
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,680
however there were certain concerns

329
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
such as that they were hard to remember

330
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,319
insecure

331
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,639
not an improvement and hard to type

332
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
nevertheless users were very receptive

333
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
and interested in knock codes

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,880
showing that they are open to new

335
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,880
authentication schemes

336
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,680
to conclude we performed the first user

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
study and security analysis of knock

338
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,638
codes

339
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
and we've come to the conclusion that

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,839
now codes offer less security

341
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
relative other forms of mobile

342
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
authentication

343
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,319
participants in our study found knock

344
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,399
codes mostly unusable and insecure

345
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,959
yet using a block list with knock codes

346
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,279
improves its security

347
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,880
