00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,799
i'm really looking forward to presenting

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,879
you our work

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
on an investigation of fishing awareness

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,359
and education over time

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
when and how to best remind users to

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
start right off

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,598
we conducted a longitudinal study we

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
systematically measured a retention for

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,840
an on-site tutorial on phishing and

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,799
detection in an organization over 12

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,800
months

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,640
and we developed and tested reminder

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,559
measures to replenish awareness and

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
knowledge about fishing when both is

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,440
not sufficient anymore before going into

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
the detail about our study i want to say

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,559
a few words about

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,239
setting of the study and the four minor

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,399
measures we used

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,399
we cooperated with a state office for

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
geo information and state survey

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
the organization has about around 2.2

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
thousand employees

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
and all of these employees had to do a

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,879
mandatory

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,800
training in a tutorial so every employee

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,280
was trained in detecting fishing

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
um to stay as close to the actual

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
organization context the organization

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
used the train the trainer approach

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
within your fish course you know fish

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,240
cores what has already been studied in a

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,720
lot of different variants like android

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,960
app video or instructor-based training

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
and the no fish course was adapted

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,119
to the organization setting in a way

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
that used examples were actual examples

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,520
that the organization

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,840
received themselves for those 2.2

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,759
000 employees the participation in the

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
actual study about the awareness of

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
knowledge retention was optional

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
after cleaning data for reasons like

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,320
external help we ended up with 409

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
participants

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,839
starting with the reminder measures we

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
had some requirements they were supposed

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
to fulfill

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
the measure should remind them of every

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,479
aspect of the tutorial without having

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,560
additional information

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
content-wise we decided to put the

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,360
following information in the reminder

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
measures

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
first what actually can be dangerous in

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,758
the context of phishing

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,399
second how to check for plausibility and

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,200
third

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,038
how to examine urls links and

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,599
attachments

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,440
in the end we decided for four different

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,839
reminder measures the different kind of

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
representation of the same content

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
first of all we developed a text like a

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,519
leaflet

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,120
that has all the information in written

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,160
form with pictures but no interactivity

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
second we used a video that explains

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
everything with the story of a person

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,519
receiving phishing emails

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,360
with links and attachments third

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
we developed an interactive email

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,440
example that looks like an email

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
with different focus points that the

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
participant can hover over to get

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,519
information like how to find a domain

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,680
and an url finally we developed a short

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200
text measure reducing the text to the

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
most essential parts

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,440
that can be used as rules to detect

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
phishing

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,879
now i want to present the results from

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
our study in more detail

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,120
all groups participated in the same

86
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,959
study with some only small variations in

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
the beginning of the study they received

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
the study details

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,079
for a role play that they were supposed

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,080
to follow afterwards

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
they had 20 screenshots in a random

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,519
order to judge whether they are

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
fraudulent or legitimate

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,480
the study concluded with a few control

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
questions like asking for external help

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,319
we found that the participants in the

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,319
group directly after the tutorial were

98
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,480
significantly better than before

99
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,760
and the same holds for the group after

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
four months

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
the group after six months was not

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
significantly better anymore

103
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,679
which does not mean that they were back

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,000
to the level as before

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
as we decided before that at such point

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,440
we will provide our reminder measures we

107
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,599
directly choose four groups with each

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,120
group receiving one reminder measure to

109
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,798
check whether this would improve their

110
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
awareness and knowledge back to a

111
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
significant level

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
we found that all of those groups except

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
for the short text achieved a

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,519
significantly better

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,399
result to before the tutorial

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
six months later so like 12 months after

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,120
the tutorial

118
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,280
we found that only two groups the video

119
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,439
and the interactive email example group

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
still achieved a significantly better

121
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,199
result

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,199
to sum up our results we systematically

123
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,240
measured the onsite tutorial and found

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,960
that it helped until

125
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
roughly four to six months afterwards

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
employees needed

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
a reminder measure like the interactive

128
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
email example a text or video

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,320
to help raise the awareness and

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,159
knowledge back to a significant level

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
looking at the results of the 12 months

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
one should probably only use the

133
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,520
interactive email example or the video

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
as a reminder measure thanks to

135
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
for listening and thanks for my

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:57,840
co-authors feel free to contact me via

137
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,840
