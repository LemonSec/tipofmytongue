00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
hello

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,920
my name is nura and in this presentation

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,759
i'd like to talk about our work on

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
vulnerability discovery and management

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,880
this is joint work with my advisor and

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,720
colleagues from uc berkeley and dixie

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,640
over the last few years we witnessed

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
that organization started to utilize

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,119
various different security testing

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
strategies

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
and have defensive and defensive teams

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,359
in place in order to identify security

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
flaws

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
and verify the effectiveness of security

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
measures they have implemented

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,919
there is also arise in the use of bug

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,879
party programs and third party testing

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
contractors

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,920
who offer services such as incident

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,078
response threat team involvement testing

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,079
the software and academic communities

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
have also developed many advanced static

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
or dynamic connectivity detection tools

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
and techniques

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
that can be utilized before releasing

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,839
software to users or after putting

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,160
software into production

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
unfortunately despite these tremendous

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,038
efforts cyber intrusions are still on

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,279
the rise

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,720
and while prior work has studied various

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
aspects of vulnerability discovery

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,039
processes

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,199
there are a number of questions that are

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,119
yet to be answered such as how to

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
determine which strategy is best suited

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
for a given situation

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,680
and what factors do organizations take

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
into consideration

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
before they decide for example to create

41
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,639
a bug warranty program

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,439
and enter another team or higher third

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
party testing contractor

44
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,119
it's also unclear how these varying

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,720
strategies are applied in practice

46
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,320
and how effective each of them is in

47
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,320
helping organizations achieve their

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
security goals

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
to answer these questions and to

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
understand the challenges security teams

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
face working with each other

52
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,880
we conducted 53 interviews with security

53
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,079
practitioners in technical and

54
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
managerial roles

55
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,479
tasked with motivity discovery and

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,240
management our sample included the blue

57
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
red and purple teamers penetration

58
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,439
testers security consultants bug bounty

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
hunters and security managers

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
most of our participants were from the

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
us but we had many participants from

62
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,839
other countries such as canada and india

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,600
most of our participants with managerial

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
experience had made important decisions

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,559
on vulnerability discovery processes in

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,720
their organizations

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,399
moreover we tailored our interview

68
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
questions to participants roles and

69
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,480
prior testing experiences

70
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
for non-managerial participants we asked

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
about the discovery processes they

72
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,399
follow

73
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
how they communicate with other teams

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
and the challenges they face that might

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
hinder their work

76
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
for participants with managerial

77
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
experience we try to capture their

78
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,679
experiences working with different teams

79
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,359
their rationale behind deploying

80
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
specific testing strategies

81
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,319
and their expectations from the

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
different testing strategies

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
we use several channels for recruitment

84
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
including advertising the study on

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
twitter and fuselage workspaces

86
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,519
which are used by testers and bug bounty

87
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,599
hunters to share resources i collaborate

88
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
most of our interviews take from 45 to

89
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,720
70 minutes

90
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,238
by conducting these interviews we wanted

91
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
to gain a holistic understanding of

92
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,560
vulnerability management processes in

93
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
the world

94
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,080
focusing in understanding the industrial

95
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
experiences of our participants

96
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
who held engineering positions

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,120
managerial positions or both

98
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,800
and worked hidden internal security

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
teams or as third party testing

100
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
contractors

101
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,200
after finalizing our data collection

102
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
phase we developed a codeback for the

103
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
study

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
and arranged our codes to capture the

105
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,879
three phases what we call

106
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
the vulnerability management pipeline

107
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,079
which captures the activities from the

108
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
moment the organization's decision

109
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
makers realize that they need security

110
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,159
testing

111
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
to the methods chosen to perform that

112
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
testing to when discovered

113
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
vulnerabilities are fixed

114
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
for the first phase we wanted to

115
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
understand decision makers

116
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
rationale behind decisions that relate

117
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
to creating bug bounty programs

118
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,440
and the factors that go into their

119
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
decision processes when they decide to

120
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,680
create internal red devil or purple

121
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
teams

122
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,720
versus outsourced security tests into

123
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,840
third-party contractors

124
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,840
or by guarantee hunters

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
for the vulnerability discovery phase we

126
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,040
try to capture the activities testers

127
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
carry out

128
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
once they begin searching for

129
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,119
vulnerabilities in target systems

130
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
the third phase concerns deciding how to

131
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
fix uncovered vulnerabilities

132
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,319
to mitigate potential risks our

133
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
interviews captured participants

134
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,119
experiences with vulnerability radiation

135
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
processes

136
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
and helped us understand how

137
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,119
organizations prioritize remediation

138
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
tasks

139
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,760
and triage vulnerability reports

140
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,159
received from external researchers

141
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,358
after analyzing our data set we found

142
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
that there are common themes and

143
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,320
participants responses

144
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
that relate to behavioral and

145
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,320
organizational factors namely

146
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,080
we found that there are trust problems

147
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
between internal testers and external

148
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,039
researchers

149
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,719
such as web bounty hunters or testers

150
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,840
who work with third party contractors

151
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,759
we also find that there are

152
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
communication and information sharing

153
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,320
problems

154
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
between different internal teams or

155
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,520
between internal teams and external

156
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,880
testers more importantly we also find

157
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,320
that organizations struggle with

158
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,759
vulnerability remediation

159
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
and one of the reasons why this is the

160
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,280
case is that there is lack of clarity

161
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
around who's responsible for planning

162
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,159
and implementing mediation plans

163
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,600
another common theme is that there is a

164
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
tendency towards implementing

165
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
compliance-oriented approaches to

166
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,080
security testing

167
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
and that organizations are more likely

168
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,039
to improve their vulnerability discovery

169
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,840
and management activities

170
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,719
if they are trying to fulfill compliance

171
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,239
requirements

172
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,680
now i'm going to group our file leads

173
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,560
according to the three phases of the

174
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
pipeline

175
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,320
for the strategic decision-making phase

176
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
we found that many of our participants

177
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
were uncertain

178
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
as to how their roles within their

179
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
organizations were liberty management

180
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
processes

181
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,560
this finding was supported by the

182
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,240
perspective of a participant

183
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
who works as a ceo of a security

184
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
consultancy who mentioned that clients

185
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,960
often ask for services that they don't

186
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,120
need

187
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,080
or might not know when to hire a team

188
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,160
versus an internet response team

189
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,359
interestingly many participants who held

190
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
managerial positions

191
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
considered workability programs as

192
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,080
effective replacements to internal

193
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,840
security testing

194
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,840
a misconception which might lead

195
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,080
organizations to get a process of

196
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,638
security

197
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,560
as for pentesting participants expressed

198
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
two main motives solving contests

199
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
and the main one is to make sure that

200
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
they meet their compliance requirements

201
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,360
or to make sure that they cover their

202
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
requirements before they create

203
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
blackboard programs

204
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
the second reason is to get reports of

205
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,440
higher quality compared to reports they

206
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,520
receive from bug bounty hunters

207
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
participants also brought up the idea

208
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
that they'd want to shift liability from

209
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,840
their organizations to their third party

210
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,440
contractors

211
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,599
once the security incident happens

212
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,759
we also found that organizations might

213
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
decide not to hire an accelerated team

214
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
when they have concerns regarding

215
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
exposure to legal liability

216
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,479
some participants were worried that

217
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,638
testers might reveal sensitive

218
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,000
information to outsiders if they found

219
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,039
something illegal during their

220
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,960
activities

221
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,479
they mentioned that it's hard to get

222
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
full visibility into what threat teams

223
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,280
who are contracted as external parties

224
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
are doing

225
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,559
this illustrates another dimension of

226
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,080
the trust problem we mentioned earlier

227
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
earlier in the presentation

228
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
and also impacts organizations decisions

229
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,719
of how to define the scope for their

230
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,719
testing activities

231
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,240
from red teamers perspectives they

232
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
explained that having restrictive

233
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,720
testing scopes often limits what they

234
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,039
can do

235
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,560
to simulate the adversary and might lead

236
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,280
to leaving large parts of their clients

237
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,520
attack services uncovered

238
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
as for blue teams almost all of our

239
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,719
participants agreed that all

240
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
organizations should have a blue team in

241
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,960
place

242
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
that is ready to detect intrusions and

243
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,198
respond accordingly

244
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,039
unfortunately many participants also

245
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,039
mentioned that their organizations

246
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,560
decided to set up blue teams only after

247
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
they experienced serious security

248
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
incidents

249
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
which illustrates an example of a

250
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
reactive approach vulnerability

251
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,758
management

252
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,840
that organizations might take

253
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
interestingly many participants from

254
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,638
small organizations prefer to set up a

255
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,319
purple team

256
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,440
rather than have a red team and a blue

257
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,520
team to decrease established costs

258
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
as for the motivations behind creating

259
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
blockbuster programs

260
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
we found that the high cost of pent

261
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
testing services is a primary motivator

262
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,479
even for large tech companies who have

263
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,759
more resources compared to medium and

264
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,758
small science organizations

265
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,599
on the other hand we also had

266
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
participants who had reasons for not

267
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,719
creating bug bounty programs

268
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
and these participants were mostly

269
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,919
working for financial and governmental

270
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
organizations

271
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
one of the main reasons is that they

272
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
don't want to risk embedded testers

273
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,318
gaining unauthorized access to data

274
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,919
starting their systems

275
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,199
and this is why they found it hard to

276
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,719
convince decision makers in their

277
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,960
organizations to create web grantee

278
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
programs

279
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,159
to address this challenge other

280
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
participants explained

281
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,919
that they chose to create private

282
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
variety problems or narrow the scope of

283
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,240
their public bug bounty programs

284
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,759
to include a few systems but this has a

285
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
disadvantage that security testing

286
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
wouldn't cover all of their attack

287
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
surface

288
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,519
participants also mentioned that

289
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,519
sometimes they create duplicate

290
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,679
environments for the testers to work on

291
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
after removing all the sensitive data

292
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,079
for example

293
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,240
a security leader for security

294
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,080
consultancy company that works as a

295
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
government contractor mentioned

296
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
trying to convince any government agency

297
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
to try to offer people a reward to try

298
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,199
to break into their financial data i

299
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
think we would have a

300
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
very bad reaction to that what is saying

301
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
it's an audit would be

302
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,959
a much easier so there is also a third

303
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
category of organizations

304
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,560
which have budget and staffing shortage

305
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,839
of problems and therefore

306
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,359
thought that they cannot afford to

307
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
create a bug warranty program and deal

308
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
with the overheads of receiving reports

309
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,319
from external testers

310
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,399
getting back to them in a timely manner

311
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,000
and providing satisfactory rewards

312
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,399
and here is an example of a system of a

313
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
large organization who mentioned that

314
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,519
their organization decided not to have a

315
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
bug body program

316
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
by saying we already know about more

317
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,920
risks than you have the capacity to deal

318
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
with

319
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
we also found that participants from

320
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
small organizations were concerned

321
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
that qualified bug bounty hunters

322
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
wouldn't work on testing their systems

323
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
since they would prefer to work for

324
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,959
organizations that offer high payouts

325
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,080
and many small organizations might not

326
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,079
have the budget to do that

327
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,880
for the second phase of the pipeline we

328
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,399
found that security teams face

329
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
communication challenges working with

330
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,720
each other

331
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,560
and this might make it difficult to

332
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
identify who's responsible for fixing

333
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,119
discover vulnerabilities

334
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
who's in charge of handling

335
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,480
vulnerability reports and understand

336
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,480
who's responsible for which systems

337
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
particularly for large organizations

338
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,079
participants mentioned that

339
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,199
often there are many teams spread over

340
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,319
different departments

341
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
i thought that having such a

342
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
decentralized approach about humility

343
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
management

344
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,680
makes it hard for their security teams

345
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,040
to collaborate and keep

346
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,279
track of their liberty discovery

347
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,120
activities

348
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,560
a number of strategies were suggested by

349
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
our participants to address this

350
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
challenge

351
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,640
which mainly aim at allowing engineers

352
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,439
to test different systems at different

353
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,199
point in time

354
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
to familiarize themselves with different

355
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
systems nominate representatives

356
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
from other teams and ask them to meet on

357
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
a regular basis

358
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
and set up a purple team to help bridge

359
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,640
the communication gap between blue teams

360
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,560
and red teams

361
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
trust is another common challenge which

362
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
might lead organizations to narrow the

363
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
scopes of their testing activities

364
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
when they don't trust accelerated

365
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,439
testers this might make it challenging

366
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,240
for external testers to do their jobs

367
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
effectively

368
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,079
and cover a great deal of their clients

369
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,519
attack services for the same reason

370
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,040
but body hunters might come across

371
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
vulnerabilities that are out of discover

372
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
blog party program policies

373
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
and decide not to report their

374
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
discoveries when they feel that

375
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
organizations might take legal actions

376
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,519
against them

377
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
we believe that external testers can be

378
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,079
helpful allies for organizations to

379
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
improve their security

380
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,599
postures and there should be policies

381
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that allow reported vulnerabilities that

382
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
are out of scope

383
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,640
our findings suggest that most

384
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,160
organizations struggle with

385
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,920
vulnerability mediation

386
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
organizations should work on improving

387
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,199
triaging activities

388
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,800
by assigning knowledgeable people to the

389
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
task of filtering the numerator parts

390
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,079
received from external researchers

391
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,439
this might help eliminate the

392
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,880
possibility of leaving a critical

393
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
nominality undetected

394
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,000
by closing vulnerability reports as

395
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,920
insignificant or out of scope

396
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
on the other hand we also encourage

397
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
external researchers to include as much

398
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
detail as possible in their reports

399
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,399
to help organizations take informed

400
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,240
decisions on how to handle them

401
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,600
we discuss the possibility of involving

402
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
external testers and vulnerability

403
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,399
remediation

404
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,240
and for that some organizations welcomed

405
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,160
the idea and thought that it would be a

406
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,920
good step forward

407
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
however from external tester

408
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,040
perspectives they also felt that the

409
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,479
current ecosystem

410
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,719
doesn't incentivize them to harvard

411
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
converted deviation

412
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,360
with some testers feeling that

413
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,040
monumental mediation should be the

414
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,040
responsibility of internal teams

415
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,880
other external testers saw that they

416
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
would be willing to help organizations

417
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
by re-testing released patches and

418
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,360
giving them confirmation

419
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,440
that the reported vulnerabilities are

420
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,360
fixed

421
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
there is also another problem which is

422
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
that neither external testers

423
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,000
nor internal teams might have all the

424
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,360
information needed to address a

425
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
discovery vulnerability in a timely

426
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
manner

427
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,199
internal testers might not understand

428
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
the context in which the vulnerability

429
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
was discovered

430
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
whereas external testers might probably

431
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,959
lack the specifics

432
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,040
of how an organization systems are

433
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,160
architected and the various data flows

434
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,680
between these systems

435
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,959
among other factors from security

436
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,239
managers perspectives

437
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,760
many expressed that they might

438
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,760
themselves be unable to implement a

439
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,200
suggested remediation strategy

440
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
and highlighted the importance of

441
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,920
explaining more than one strategy and

442
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
vulnerability reports

443
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
so that they can reach an informed

444
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
decision on how to implement an

445
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,040
effective fix

446
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,439
other participants thought that whenever

447
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
mediation needs a specific skill set

448
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
which might be hard to get in many

449
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
organizations and therefore

450
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
having detailed information

451
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,719
vulnerability reports would be very

452
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,320
helpful for organizations

453
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,240
one dangerous observation that many

454
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,920
testers who are contracted as external

455
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
parties brought to our attention

456
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,279
is that they often get asked by their

457
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,880
clients to change the validity ratings

458
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,720
of critical vulnerabilities

459
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,000
or remove such vulnerabilities from

460
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
reports they plan to submit to

461
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639
regulators

462
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,560
this is exacerbated by the fact that

463
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,479
testers might be pressured to comply

464
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,760
with such requests by their managers to

465
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
maintain relationships with their

466
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,680
clients

467
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,199
and here is one example of an external

468
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,199
pen tester who mentioned that it's

469
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,959
common for clients to say something like

470
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,800
we don't want you to solve the problem

471
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,880
we just want you to make the checkbox go

472
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,959
away

473
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,639
in light of our findings we recommend

474
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,599
that organizations don't create bug

475
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
bounty programs

476
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,639
before performing comprehensive pen

477
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,479
tests setting up

478
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,680
proper monitoring and detection tools

479
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
and having solved the remediation

480
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,279
process

481
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,360
in place second we expect having a clear

482
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,800
set of risk priorities to facilitate

483
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
making informed decisions on how to

484
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
handle discover vulnerabilities

485
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
and bring engineering and managerial

486
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,199
people to common understanding of

487
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,360
potential risks that an organization is

488
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,519
willing to take

489
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
third we expect providing incentives for

490
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,320
accelera researchers

491
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,160
to help with vulnerability remediation

492
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,880
to make it easier for internal teams to

493
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,120
implement better remediation plans

494
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,800
and finally we expect organizations to

495
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,480
have a clear guidelines for identifying

496
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
the technical and business owners of the

497
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
various systems they have

498
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
very early process so that remediation

499
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,760
tasks can be assigned smoothly

500
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,720
and this way they can reduce the time

501
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,880
from discovery to remediation

502
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
in summary we conducted interviews with

503
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
security practitioners

504
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,600
tasked with vulnerability discovery and

505
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,359
management and found that the remedy

506
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,360
discovery and management processes

507
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,880
are hindered by a host of behavioral and

508
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
organizational factors

509
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
more importantly we found that the

510
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,440
current ecosystem is more focused on

511
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,920
vulnerability discovery

512
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
and less on vulnerability remediation we

513
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,240
hope that this work will motivate

514
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,240
further research

515
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
to better understand the human factors

516
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
impact the vulnerability discovery and

517
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:26,319
the radiation processes in the world

518
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:28,399
thank you

519
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,399
you
