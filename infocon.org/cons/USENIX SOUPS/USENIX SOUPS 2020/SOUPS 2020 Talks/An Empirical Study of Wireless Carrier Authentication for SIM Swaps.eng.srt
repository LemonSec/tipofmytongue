00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,719
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,840
my name is kevin lee today i will be

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,440
presenting a study

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,000
in which we looked at an attack on

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,240
telecoms called sim swaps

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,198
we investigated the feasibility and

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,198
implications

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,439
of these attacks let's begin

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800
a sim swap is an attack in which cell

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
service in your phone

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,079
is diverted into another sim card in

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,079
another phone

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
thereby cutting off your phone service

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
and placing it in the hands of an

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,960
unauthorized entity

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
in an attack the adversary poses as the

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
victim

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
and calls into the victim's carrier to

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,079
request a sim swap

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
after the exchange the victim's carrier

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,680
goes ahead with a request

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,559
and moves service over to a sim card in

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,800
the adversary's possession

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,839
in doing so this cuts off all phone

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,718
service to the victim

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
in our diagram the victim also uses sms

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
two-factor authentication for her bank

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
account

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,840
as a result the adversary can now

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,640
receive passcodes used for

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,720
authentication clearly

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
attackers can abuse this to hijack phone

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,840
numbers

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
once they have taken over a number

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,600
attackers can bypass

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,200
sms two-factor authentication and

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,119
perform further impersonation attacks

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,439
we've seen this to be an industry-wide

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,400
problem with constant stories about sim

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,399
swaps in the news

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
our goal is to analyze carrier policy

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,119
for sim swaps

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
to that end we studied five carriers in

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,920
the prepaid market

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,720
by signing up for accounts and calling

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,720
in to request a sim swap

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,079
at all these carriers we were able to

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,158
break in

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,000
and we found insecure challenges being

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
used across all carriers

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
this table shown lists all the

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,479
authentication challenges we saw at

53
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,559
least once

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,719
we group these into different categories

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,920
and rate them based on their strength

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,839
red represents insecure green is secure

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
and yellow is insecure but previously

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
unknown

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
i'd like to bring your attention to the

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
previously unknown challenges

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
we realized that these challenges use

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
information that can be created by an

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,120
attacker in order to gain knowledge over

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,519
at two carriers we were asked to provide

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
information about the last payment

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,239
four carriers including those two allow

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
for unauthenticated refills with refill

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
cards

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
an attacker can create a record after

70
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
making a payment using a store-bought

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,519
refill card

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440
at three carriers we were asked to name

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
recently dialed numbers

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,440
an attacker can trick victims into

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
calling known numbers and some carriers

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,879
even let us use incoming call records

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,079
tutor credit after reviewing our

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,679
research t-mobile

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,599
informed us that they had made changes

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
to their customer authentication policy

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,000
we also found vulnerabilities in csrs

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,319
and by extension csr interfaces

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,319
on multiple occasions csrs at two

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,119
carriers allowed us to sim swap without

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,280
ever correctly authenticating

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
some carriers even disclose personal

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
information without authentication

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,518
including answers to authentication

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,519
challenges

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,159
earlier i had mentioned that with a sim

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
swap multi-factor authentication using

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,879
sms can now be compromised

93
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
which could lead to account break-ins in

94
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,000
the second part of the study

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
we sought to reverse engineer the

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
authentication policies of popular

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,319
websites and determine how easy it is

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,879
for an attacker to compromise a user's

99
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
account

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,280
provided that they have successfully

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
carried out a sim swap

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
we signed up for accounts at each

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,319
service and examined the multi-factor

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,359
authentication login schemes and

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,879
recovery option pairs

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640
it's important to note that accounts

107
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
were not filled out with anything beyond

108
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
requested

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
personal information authentication

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
findings may be different for real world

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
accounts with linked value

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
such as finance apps with attached bank

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
accounts

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
the reason being there is more risk and

115
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,640
hence authentication policies may be

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,120
stricter

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,958
nevertheless our method is useful for

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
real world users to take a look at their

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
configurations and for companies to

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,000
review their policies

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
we found that most of these websites

122
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,359
recommend sms for two-factor

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
authentication

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,080
this means that if you get sim-swapped

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
your qfa can now be bypassed the

126
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
attacker would then only need your

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
password

128
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
which they could obtain via data dumps

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,280
social engineering

130
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,639
or compromising a means of account

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,638
recovery such as email

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,040
more importantly we found 17 additional

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,440
sites that allow for account takeover

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,520
with a sim swap alone

135
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,600
we notify these websites as part of the

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
responsible disclosure process

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,840
and some websites have responded by

138
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,000
making fixes and reporting them back to

139
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,400
us

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
read our full findings recommendations

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,880
