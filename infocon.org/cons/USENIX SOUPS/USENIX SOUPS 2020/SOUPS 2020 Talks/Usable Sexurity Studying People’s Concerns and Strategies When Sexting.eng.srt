1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,440
hi

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,719
i'm christine ging and today i'll be

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,719
talking about our paper

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,320
usable sex security studying people's

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,039
concerns and strategies when sexting

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,439
so first we approach consensual sexting

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,680
as

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,759
a normal human behavior not something

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
that's deviant

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
in fact about 26 percent of american

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,640
adults have sent

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,520
nude or something new photos of

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,719
themselves to someone else

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,879
however it can come with risks such as

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,840
coercion to sex in relationships

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
receiving unsolicited sex and revenge

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
porn

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
one study shows that one in 25 online

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,839
americans have been a victim

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,600
or of or threatened with revenge porn

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,879
and these risks are higher for younger

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
women and queer individuals

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
so we have the question of how can

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,239
platforms better support sexual

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,240
privacy and this is a type of privacy

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
that requires being able to secure

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,320
autonomy enable intimacy

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
and protect equality

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,679
with the goal of answering that question

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
in mind we came up with three research

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
questions

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,439
so for adults who have sex did before

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,439
what are their experiences with sexting

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,758
their concerns and their mitigation

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,600
strategies

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,079
answer this question we conducted a

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,559
mixed methods online survey

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,720
using prolific we recruited adults who

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,880
sexed or have sexted before

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,920
and our study was irb approved

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,479
on to our results so in our paper we

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
describe

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,200
sexting frequency platform usage sharing

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,720
storage concerns and strategies but for

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
the sake of time i'll only be talking

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,880
about concerns and strategies

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,880
so the top five concerns that came up

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,119
around sexting for participants

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,158
included sex getting around to other

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,880
people

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,600
sex being used as blackmail receiving

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,399
unsolicited content

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,879
the receiver's devices getting hacked

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,800
and shoulder surfing

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
with regard to receiving unsolicited

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
content

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,119
we found that women and non-binary

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,720
people were significantly more likely to

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,319
receive unsolicited sex

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
and be concerned about this than men

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,640
now i'll talk about strategies both

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,560
technical and

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,920
non-technical so some of the technical

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
management strategies that our

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,679
participants talked about

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
including included disappearing messages

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,920
and password-protecting stored sex

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,440
the latter of which um one example

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,559
is the my eyes only private album

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
on snapchat in terms of non-technical

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
strategies

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,440
these included getting to know the

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,679
person first and communicating rules and

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
boundaries

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
some of our participants use a mix of

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,319
both strategies

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,879
so for example one participant wrote i

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,799
sucked with

79
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,480
i sexed with my partner who might trust

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
and we had several conversations about

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,399
sexting before we started

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,679
when to delete photos if we were at risk

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,920
of revenge pointing each other

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,840
we're not and from there we talked about

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,319
several different platforms and

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,599
ultimately chose an encrypted platform

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,879
it's not completely safe

88
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,879
but it's a calculated risk

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,080
on to our discussion

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040
so in terms of how platforms can better

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
support sexual privacy

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,599
we broke this down into policy

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,798
suggestions community moderation

94
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,560
and interface design suggestions so in

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
terms of policy

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,879
community guidelines can be written to

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
encourage asking for consent before

98
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,640
saving images

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,760
and to not allow harassment such as

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
unsolicited sex

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,798
the latter of which is common amongst

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,798
dating apps

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
in terms of community moderation there

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,439
must be sufficient enforcement

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,680
of policy changes like the ones i

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
suggested

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
another suggestion is to automatically

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
detect and blur unsolicited needs

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,760
which is something that developers are

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
already working on

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
in terms of interface design one

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,959
suggestion is

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
not allowing photos to be sent unless

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
both people in a conversation enable the

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
feature

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
or for dating apps have a profile

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,479
disclosure like grinder

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,639
so they allow a user to

119
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,120
edit whether or not they accept not safe

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,600
for work picks

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
so in conclusion our results cover

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,680
sexing frequency platform usage

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,919
sharing storage concerns and strategies

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,240
and platforms can support sexual privacy

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,840
by considering consent through policy

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,840
moderation and design thank you very

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
much

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
you
