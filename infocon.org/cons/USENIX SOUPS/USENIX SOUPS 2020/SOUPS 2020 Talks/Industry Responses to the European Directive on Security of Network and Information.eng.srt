00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,759
hi everyone

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,599
my name is olami halets i am a social

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,079
scientist based at the university of

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,560
bristol cybersecurity research group

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,479
our paper will present industry

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,320
responses the european directive

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
on network and information system

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,840
security or nis for short i know it's

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
quite a mouthful

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
this is based on 30 interviews with

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,599
critical infrastructure stakeholders

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,520
across the uk

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,440
functioning of our society depends on

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
critical infrastructures by which we

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,800
mean facilities providing water

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
energy healthcare transport or similar

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
services

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,520
these systems use so-called operational

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,519
technologies

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
that provides and such services

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
operational technologies is an umbrella

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,718
10 for engineering equipment

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
traditionally built for safety and

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,360
resilience

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
and what's interesting is that these

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
operational technologies have been going

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
through modernization

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
they now slowly blending with it and

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
slowly connecting to the internet

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
and is done to make the most of the

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,439
promises of innovation such as big data

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,280
iot of machine learning algorithms

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,520
however this creates new

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
dangers for cyber security there could

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
be blackouts in power stations

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,640
pollution of water supply or hacked

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,720
traffic lights

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
and this directive aims to prevent us

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,400
from the worst

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,240
case scenario and improve the baseline

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
level of security across critical

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,399
infrastructures in europe

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,439
however critics have questions whether a

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
nist could become

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119
a thick box exercise or indeed or indeed

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,799
what a nice could

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,960
lead to long-term improvements in

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
security practices

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,360
therefore our research seeks to

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,759
understand how the expertise in critical

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,600
infrastructure security is created

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,280
the notion of technical expertise is

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,039
crucial to understand

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
as it's increasingly influencing the

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
direction of policies like this

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
usually policy makers don't have the

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,759
technical expertise to make

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,158
key decisions alone and as a result a

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,960
fascinating interface of policy experts

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,000
i.t experts and all the expert emerges

61
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,639
so our findings are as follows first of

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,920
all without

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,720
ot specific expertise security advice

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
risks becoming a trope so we introduced

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,800
the term security trope

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,760
to analyze common beliefs about security

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
which require

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,359
a further level of detail before that

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,640
can be successfully applied to the ot

70
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,040
context

71
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,238
since all drops are quite generic they

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
lead to creation of

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
advice which can be easily marketed at

74
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,200
mass scale

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,280
however and also because rt

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,958
and tropes are quite vague they can

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,319
appeal to professionals from diverse

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,959
backgrounds

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,799
so our paper discusses the issues that

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
arise from following for tropes in

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
detail

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
and these strokes are first air gapping

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
means security

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,959
second innovation is inevitable we can't

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
shape the internet of things

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
four three security solutions are the

87
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
same across

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
sectors for raising awareness least

89
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
security

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,239
so our second finding is that this

91
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,760
implementation faces the dilemma

92
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,760
there is an increasing pressure to

93
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,518
recruit alti security experts

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,959
by which we mean practitioners skilled

95
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,159
in both engineering and computer

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
scientists

97
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,840
meanwhile the quality and expertise of

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,959
ot security professionals is

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
inconsistent

100
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,640
and that's because of the varied reasons

101
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,519
to career the profession itself is quite

102
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,679
new

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
so without recognized qualifications

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,360
employers face a challenge to identify

105
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,799
capable candidates as the question of

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
this implementation

107
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
is positioned in the center of this

108
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,079
dilemma

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
we risk that poorly evidence and old

110
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,959
inappropriate advice will be circulated

111
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,720
to influence key security decisions

112
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
furthermore we argue that filling this

113
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
skills cup is more than

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
simply a matter of supply and demand in

115
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
ot

116
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,760
snes pertains to services essential for

117
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,760
the society

118
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,920
it requires attention to public value

119
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
such as privacy sustainability or

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,079
affordability and going deeper our

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,359
research analyzed tropes of policy

122
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,799
analysis types of policy implementation

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
practices

124
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,040
so for example how technical advice

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
interacts with policy decisions

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,879
we wanted to highlight that critical

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
infrastructures play an active role in

128
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,798
shaping policy responses

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
and they roll reaches far beyond

130
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,880
compliance

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,919
as such we found four types of policy

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
practices

133
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,320
compliance workarounds going above and

134
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,440
beyond policy remit and finally

135
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,159
negotiation of

136
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,000
policy we develop this classification

137
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,680
and support it with empirical data in

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
the full version of the paper

139
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
and finally we conclude the research

140
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,440
with five police recommendations

141
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,680
similarly can find them in the full

142
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,520
paper i encourage you to read it

143
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
so that's it from us i am happy to take

144
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,320
questions over emails slack and other

145
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:57,840
channels

146
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:57,840
bye now

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
you
