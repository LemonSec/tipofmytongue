hi

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,559
i'm george and i'm delighted to present

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,320
our research exploring the role of user

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,799
experience in the security and privacy

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,880
design of smart home cameras

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
smart home devices offer great utility

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,840
and functionality

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
however the rise in the adoption of

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,000
those devices is accompanied with new

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,680
security and privacy threats

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
the need for users saturday's security

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
and privacy design is important

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,320
given that inhabitants are

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,719
demographically diverse and have

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,200
different

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,960
abilities prior work has explored

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
different usable security and privacy

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
solutions for smart homes however

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,959
the applicability of user experience

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
principles the security and privacy

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
design is underexplored

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,800
in this study we explore how design

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,920
teams factor ux in the security and

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,839
privacy design of smart cameras

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
we conducted a qualitative user study

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
with 20 participants in the uk

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,840
focusing on understanding the design

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,920
processes of smart cameras

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
we reached out to participants on online

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
platforms and we also recruited them

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
through snowball sampling

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,119
which allowed us to reach employees that

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,040
were not easily accessible

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
we conducted our interviews remotely

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
using skype and zoom

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,880
all interviews were analyzed using

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,759
routed theory which resulted in a code

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,920
book of 155 codes

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
we interviewed 12 male and 8 female

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
participants

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,000
and age ranged from 25 to 52 we divided

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
our participants into six

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,520
groups of stakeholders based on

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,479
employment such as security

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,759
ux and management we identified five

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,360
themes that i will go through briefly

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,200
all three companies use agile

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
methodologies and were required to

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
comply with gdpr

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
which mandates data protection by design

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
practices

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,960
udpr came into force after the smart

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
cameras had been deployed and released

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
as a result the smart cameras produced

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
before the enforcement date were

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
non-compliant

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
in addition participants reported that

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,000
asking users to consent to all users of

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,640
data in their ecosystem

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
would be overwhelming for users

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,520
withdrawing consent

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,758
was also reported as technically

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,478
challenging due to third-party products

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,478
and services

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,640
we found that design teams didn't

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,238
explicitly factory ux in the design of

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,000
security solutions

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
there was a lack of security expertise

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in design teams and security design

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
was seen as a low priority technical

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,599
only problem

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,679
in addition we found that in some cases

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
ux designers had no site of security

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
requirements

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,239
in contrast we found that design teams

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
applied to x principles and practices

77
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,400
to the design of privacy features

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
customers were given more control over

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
their privacy settings

80
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,679
in which in which ux design is reported

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,518
to increase trust

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
companies made numerous efforts to be

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,959
transparent with users

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,519
such as working with the ux designers to

85
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
create user-friendly help pages

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
participants also described different

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,879
projects that looked into ways of

88
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,799
obtaining explicit consent from the user

89
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
we found that ux was seen as helpful by

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
our participants in fostering innovation

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
in the design of privacy solutions

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,560
participants adopted a qualitative

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,560
competitive approach

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
to build new features that addressed

95
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,080
user privacy during the design phase

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
however ux was not used or considered in

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,560
the design of security solutions

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,159
due to an explicit need for its

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
established solutions

100
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,480
that is previous traditional security

101
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,239
solutions that were seen as effective

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
and reliable to fix certain design

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
problems

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,040
moreover there was a sense that new

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,519
security solutions may not be reliable

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,599
finally we found that user trust heavily

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,519
influenced text design choices

108
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,280
product teams aimed to build and nurture

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
customer trust through better privacy

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,879
experiences

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,559
product teams also aim to protect trust

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,319
relationships with their customers

113
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
through the development of policies and

114
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,000
requirements to deal with security

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
incidents

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
despite recognizing the importance of

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,798
security in the design process

118
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
our results show an inherent

119
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
contradiction between tried and tested

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
and innovative wanting innovative

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
security is in conflict with the

122
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
practice of favoring tried and tested

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,280
security solutions

124
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,518
over procuring security solution

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,760
solutions from reputable vendors

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,440
furthermore all design team used agile

127
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,839
methodologies which typically do not

128
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,680
explicitly deal with security issues

129
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,039
agile teams treated security as a

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
technical problem with technical

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
solutions

132
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,880
and not an area requiring innovation

133
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
we concluded our work with three

134
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,120
recommendations we recommended that ux

135
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,080
design teams explicitly innovate in

136
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
security

137
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,199
while these innovations may lead to new

138
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
security challenges

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
it is necessary to innovate in order to

140
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,799
design solutions that will eventually

141
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,638
become detroit and tested

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,880
we also recommended that security and

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,440
privacy be considered as a single domain

144
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,280
and wholly part of ux many technical

145
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
aspects of security and privacy

146
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,960
design can be considered as part of a

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,560
single ux domain

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
finally we recommended that the

149
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,199
compliance aspect of data protection

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,758
regulation

151
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,759
considers ux which can help identify

152
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,880
issues with compliance

153
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,199
thank you for listening to my

154
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,840
presentations if you have any questions
