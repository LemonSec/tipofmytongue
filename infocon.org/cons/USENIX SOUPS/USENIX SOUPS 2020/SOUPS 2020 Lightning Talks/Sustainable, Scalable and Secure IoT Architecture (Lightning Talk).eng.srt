00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
hello

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,000
my name is kier henderson i'm a doctor

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,360
of engineering candidate in the

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
electrical and computer engineering

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,279
department at marcus state university

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
underneath my advisor of dr kevin

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,480
cornigay today

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,000
i will be presenting our work on

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
improving system architectures

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,439
that secure our nation's critical

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,599
infrastructures

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
the major topic of my talk is how we can

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,199
improve network security and privacy due

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
to the proliferation of the internet of

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
things or iot

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
it is estimated that around 31 billion

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
iot devices will be deployed

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,440
by the end of the year an increase from

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
7 billion in 2018

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,599
the current market cap shows a large

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,039
portion of iot in many critical sectors

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,879
many that are already improperly managed

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
there are several recent high-profile

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,480
attacks that have resulted due to the

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,319
proliferation of the iot

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,078
nation states are already utilizing

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
these vulnerabilities and attacks can

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,559
range from manipulating a single

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,239
insecure device

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,759
or utilizing tens of millions of them

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920
one of the major issues we see with

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360
networks today is that they largely rely

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
on secure authentication

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
which is important but leaves much

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
oversight next we see that device

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,479
manufacturers assume that users will

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,080
actually change their default password

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
on their devices and not open their

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
ports to the public

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
outdated access policy models that were

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,119
designed for general purpose devices

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
don't work well for very

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,000
behavior-specific devices such as in iot

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,079
and access policies are also difficult

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
to implement due to the design flow of

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,880
network management

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
scaling networks are the size of iot

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,158
networks can be difficult

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,439
this leads us to the question of what

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,360
can we do to work towards a better

51
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,600
solutions

52
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
our research leverages a newly accepted

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,199
ietf standard called manufacturer

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
youtube description or mud

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
that automates the access policy of any

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
network-connected devices

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,880
based on its intended behavior and

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,600
emitted identity

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,880
but what happens when we don't know what

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,919
the device is because it isn't

61
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
broadcasting

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,479
either due to being a legacy device or

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
device manufactured before the standard

64
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,439
mud doesn't account for this behavior

65
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,598
but not architecture we designed a

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,280
legacy process to apply device-specific

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,359
access policy by creating an

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,040
identification model that utilizes

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,239
methods that actively and passively

70
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,079
fingerprint the device

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,440
creating an identity model that can be

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,040
used to link the device with an

73
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
appropriate behavior profile

74
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
in order to enforce and apply its access

75
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
control policy

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
in order to manage the network we

77
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,920
utilize software defined network

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
and open flow this network design can

79
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,319
replace or add on to current network

80
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,160
setups

81
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,518
the control server can even be moved to

82
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,040
the cloud and manage a

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,160
network of networks the same way that

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
enterprise networks do

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
what this looks like an iot device

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,359
connects

87
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
we identify the device the model in the

88
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
firmware version and then set the

89
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,079
behavior profile that

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,480
permits access only to require data

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
flows and we repeat for all devices on

92
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
the network

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
as a result of these improvements we

94
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,879
have a sustainable security architecture

95
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
the ability to proliferate as quickly as

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
internet of things

97
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
a method that accounts for legacy and

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,599
non-compliant devices

99
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,080
an automated flow that reduces user

100
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,238
error improved access controls that

101
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,000
provide much needed defense in depth

102
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
and lastly the architecture is open

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
source and an industry standard giving

104
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
the architecture more traction to

105
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
provide

106
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,799
physical results in order for this to

107
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
work

108
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
shouldn't truly be a viable solution we

109
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,319
need to continue to work towards a

110
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,518
completely operational hardware and

111
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,119
software solutions

112
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
as well as collaborate to create a

113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
database that encapsulates our iot

114
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,760
environment and their behavior

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
i'm open to any questions or feedback

116
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
about this architecture

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
and if you want to hear more about any

118
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,480
research done at the cap center or

119
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
morgan state university please reach out

120
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:58,798
to me

121
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:58,799
thank you for your time and interest
