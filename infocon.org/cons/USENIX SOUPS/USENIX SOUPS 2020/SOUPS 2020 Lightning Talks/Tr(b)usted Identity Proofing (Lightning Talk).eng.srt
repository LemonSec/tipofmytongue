1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,000
hello all

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
katie and i are going to present our

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
talk on trusted or busted identity

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
proofing

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,400
so let's see first what is identity

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,880
proofing

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,880
it is used to establish the uniqueness

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,439
and validity of an individual's

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,599
identity to facilitate the provision of

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,279
an entitlement or a service

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
in our case we'll be talking about

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
document verification such as driver's

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,800
license or

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,880
passport our talk will highlight the

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,199
results of our evaluation of third party

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,360
providers such as on fido or jumio which

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
are currently used in finance retail and

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
travel industries

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
our talk on busted identity proofing

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,160
services especially relevant amid the

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,559
current covet 19 pandemic which has

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,919
forced many organizations to shift to a

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,839
remote workforce

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,480
as a result automated identity

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,719
verification solutions have experienced

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,319
quick and widespread acceptance they

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
also introduce convenience and

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,080
efficiency

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
so let's go over the workflow it all

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
starts with the document capture where

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
you digitally scan an id

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
then the document is classified into

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
various types and subtypes

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
the service then reads and extracts the

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,400
relevant personally identifiable

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,798
information

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
and validates the format finally the

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
liveness or the selfie test is done as a

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
proof of ownership and based on that the

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
service marks the entry as a pass or a

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
fail

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,600
so let's see what happens behind the

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
scenes identity proofing solutions rely

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,640
on

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
state-of-the-art methodologies they use

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
ai classifiers to classify a document

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
based

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,360
on the country the issuing authority

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
then they use

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,840
ocr and computer vision to extract and

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,479
read the data from an id

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
finally the solution utilizes deep

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,759
learning models that

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
inarguably spot characteristics of

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
fraudulent ids

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
such as unique fonts pictures and

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
built-in securities like barcodes or

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,119
ghost images

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,079
thereby detecting any kind of digital

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,240
fraud

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,720
with this introduction now kd will go

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,478
over the test cases

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
as a congress described many of these

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
services have advanced techniques for

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,519
processing ids

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,879
which allows them to easily detect many

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,400
digital modifications

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
that may be applied to submitted

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
documents however how easily can these

70
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
techniques

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
identify physical modifications with

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
physical modifications there are no

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,319
alterations being made to the original

74
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,239
images

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,238
therefore copied bytes and font

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
mismatches are no longer present

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
as a result we were able to circumvent

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
these processes and achieve

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,879
impersonation

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
through a variety of methods the first

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
test case that displays this weakness

82
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
is the use of a modified photo we tested

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
with both a washington license

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,160
as well as an indian passport and both

85
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,079
were accepted as valid ids

86
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,920
as you can see a face was cut out from a

87
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,879
different photo and pasted onto someone

88
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
else's id

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,160
it would be very clear to the human eye

90
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,238
that these ids were modified

91
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
but to a machine it appears to be an

92
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
acceptable photo

93
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
there is also no photo comparison being

94
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
done between the actual photo and the

95
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
ghost images

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
which is a security feature a cronkite

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,440
mentioned

98
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
next test case includes a physically

99
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,200
modified name this id was scanned and

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
then a letter was cut out from the

101
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
scanned version

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
and pasted onto the real id the id was

103
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,599
accepted by the system and the edited

104
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,360
name was successfully read from the id

105
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,879
our last test case showcases the

106
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,159
weaknesses and the mentioned service's

107
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
abilities to verify

108
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,640
all necessary security features on ids

109
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,799
this test case specifically involves the

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,319
barcode found on a driver's license

111
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,920
if using a driver's license with one of

112
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,000
the proofing services you will be

113
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
required to upload the front and back of

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
your id

115
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
and data will be extracted from both

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
sides and compared to make sure that

117
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
they match

118
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
however what happens if the barcode

119
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
can't be read we generated a barcode in

120
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,959
an incorrect format that cannot be read

121
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,560
properly

122
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,080
it was then printed out and pasted onto

123
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
a valid driver's license and it was

124
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,439
accepted by the target system

125
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
this shows that if we successfully

126
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,079
change any data on the front to

127
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,840
impersonate someone

128
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
then we don't need to also generate a

129
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
valid barcode to match the change data

130
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,839
in conclusion there are two approaches

131
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,920
that we've seen for identity proofing

132
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,680
manual and automated with a manual

133
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,439
approach we can identify most physical

134
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
modifications that may be applied to an

135
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,159
id

136
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,759
you are also more often than not relying

137
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
on the actual physical id

138
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
as opposed to relying on a photo of the

139
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
id however manual proofing may not be as

140
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
convenient

141
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,919
and a decent amount of experience is

142
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
required to securely perform the

143
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
proofing

144
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
with automated proofing it's definitely

145
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
faster and more convenient in most cases

146
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
but as we've shown it falls short in

147
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,919
detecting physical modifications

148
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,198
there is also a need for a large as well

149
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
as evolving data set

150
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,360
to account for the vast amount of ids

151
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
and how often their format changes

152
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
as a result our consensus is that both

153
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:56,400
approaches are needed to provide the

154
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:58,479
most accurate proving

155
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
you
