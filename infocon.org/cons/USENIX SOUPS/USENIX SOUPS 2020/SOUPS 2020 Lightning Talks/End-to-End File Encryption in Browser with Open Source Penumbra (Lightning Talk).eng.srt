00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,480
hey soups

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,280
i'm here today to talk about end-to-end

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,120
encryption or to put another way

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,800
why we decided we did not want to see

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,119
end user data and so we sought out to

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
make that impossible for us to do so

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,560
my name is mike farrell and i'm the cto

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,920
and co-founder of transcend

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,680
a data privacy company so here at

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,880
transcend we believe that data privacy

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,320
is a human right

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,320
there have been a ton of great privacy

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
laws coming in around the world

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
and these laws are really great however

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,599
there still seems to be a bit of a

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
discrepancy between what these laws are

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
striving for and what we're seeing in

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,919
the industry today

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
so we sought out to solve this problem

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
and figure out how we can make it easier

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,399
for businesses to offer data right to

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,719
their customers

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
we power end-to-end data subject access

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,239
and erasure request

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,120
and allow customers of our customers to

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,879
view and visualize their data we realize

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,718
it would be painfully ironic for a data

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,319
privacy company to actually have access

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
to the end user data

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,960
so we sought out to solve the problem

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,880
how can we process these requests

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,839
while making it impossible for us to see

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,839
that data ourselves

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
in order to solve this problem we had a

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,720
couple requirements um

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,400
security was obviously a top priority we

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
had to make sure that there was no way

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
for

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,119
this data to be breached in any sort of

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,280
way

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
we also had to make sure it was

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
accessible to all people around the

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
world

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,158
we did not want people to have to

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,840
download some special decryption

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,680
software in order to get access to their

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,240
data we also had to have no file size

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,640
limits

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,839
we needed this to be an audible process

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
um and lastly

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
we wanted to provide a clean interface

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,839
for people to actually visualize their

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,158
data and so

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
if we were decrypting on the browser

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
this couldn't block the main thread

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
and create a choppy interface for the

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,158
end user

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
so ultimately our solution was to build

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,640
an open source library called penumbra

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
penumbra implements nn encryption and

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
decryption in the browser

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
on files that may not fit into the

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
memory of the consumer's machine

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
pinnumber takes advantage of a new

65
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,520
writable stream feature in chrome and

66
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,599
edge in order to decrypt files and chunk

67
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
we stream files from a back end and we

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,079
use we stream that through a decryption

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
algorithm

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,840
that decrypts on the browser without

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
having to buffer the entire file into

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,360
memory

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
we ultimately decide the open source

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,319
phone number because we believe that the

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
encryption it would be a great movement

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,079
across

77
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,760
industries to create a more secure

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
online world

79
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,000
we found it hard to find libraries to do

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,519
this and so we wanted to lower the entry

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
for other developers who wanted to build

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
secure applications this technology

83
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
could be used for other things such as

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,599
video chat or file transferring systems

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,840
um most of those right now

86
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,720
kind of have a file size limit and we'd

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,160
hope to allow

88
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,319
you know file drops to even be

89
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,280
incorporated into those those messaging

90
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,839
platforms

91
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,040
or say you're a human rights or activist

92
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
group and you need to send

93
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,480
data securely between between people in

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
in desperate places the project's never

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,959
really done

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
um there's quite a bit of opportunity

97
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
for people to hop on and contribute

98
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
not all browsers currently support

99
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,120
writable streams we've been

100
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,280
watching closely as firefox is laying

101
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
out the groundwork for this feature and

102
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
we hope to you know follow those along

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and incorporate

104
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,518
the the different browsers in as they

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,799
support writable streams

106
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,720
and at the same time we want to make

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,120
sure we have same fallbacks so

108
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,359
that if there's an old browser there

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
still is some way for a small package to

110
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
be viewed on

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
on the browser secondly we want to

112
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
improve the api for the webworker

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,440
communication channel

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
thirdly we want to increase the

115
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
flexibility of encryption schemes that

116
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
penumbra can support

117
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
thank you everyone for listening i hope

118
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
this was a great way to provide a bit of

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
insight about how

120
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,518
transcend thinks about end and

121
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,119
encryption uh please get in touch if you

122
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,799
have any questions or would like to talk

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
more about data rights and privacy

124
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
infrastructure

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
you
