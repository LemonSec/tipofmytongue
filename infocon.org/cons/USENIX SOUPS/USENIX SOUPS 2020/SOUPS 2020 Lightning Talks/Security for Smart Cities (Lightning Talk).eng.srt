hi

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,000
my name is josely and i'm a phd student

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,759
in city and regional planning at uc

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,759
berkeley

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
i'm working with an interdisciplinary

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,160
team that includes scholars from

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,039
urban planning political science civil

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,439
engineering

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
and computer science on a study of cyber

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,840
security

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,000
of smart cities the field of urban

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,320
studies has been largely skeptical of

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,120
smart city technologies such as smart

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
meters

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
street video surveillance and smart

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
traffic lights

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,640
scholars have called attention to a

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
range of issues including potential

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
threats to privacy

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,718
and the increased risk of disruptions to

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
vital urban services

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,480
in much of the literature however these

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
critiques are made of smart city

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,239
applications

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,718
in general rather than differentiating

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,599
between

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
particular technologies when thinking

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
about a smart home for example

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
you treat a smart light bulb in a smart

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,479
lock differently

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,799
similarly all smart city technologies

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,039
shouldn't be treated the same way

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
so our aim is to add nuance into these

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
debates by exploring the diversity of

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,798
technologies

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
and examining whether or not different

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,280
technologies are more

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,600
or less susceptible to attacks

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
our main motivation for this project is

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,240
to help policymakers and city officials

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,439
understand whether different smart city

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,158
technologies

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,158
pose different levels of cyber risks

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
since many of these new technologies are

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,040
being considered for adoption by local

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
government

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,560
agencies we believe that providing

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,279
realistic risk assessments in actionable

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,079
guidance

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,479
is a valuable service we will therefore

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,919
publish a policy report on our findings

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,079
and disseminate it among

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
organizations for it professionals in

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,279
local government

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
to understand variation in the risks

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
posed by different smart city

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
technologies

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
we're fielding an online survey to

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,520
understand the perceptions of cyber

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,599
security experts of the risks posed by

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
nine different smart city technologies

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,280
used in urban public safety

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,599
transportation and water and sanitation

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,599
the survey design draws from the cyber

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,640
security literature by understanding

66
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,959
risk

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,879
as collectively determined by the

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
underlying technical vulnerability of

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,079
the system

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
the existence of organizations or

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
individuals who are interested in

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
and capable of launching attacks as well

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,640
as the potential

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,239
impact of an attack should one occur we

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,839
ask respondents to rank these

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
technologies according to these

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
dimensions

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,640
and we also ask them about their

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,760
perceptions about threat actors

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,518
now we're here to ask for your help

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,079
first we would love you to take our

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
survey we are hoping to obtain a range

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,640
of responses from individuals

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
representing

85
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,599
different portions of the cyber security

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,200
field and you have exactly the expertise

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,280
we are looking for

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,799
we estimate that it takes around 15

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,120
minutes to fill out the survey

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,159
and we are making a 10 donation to

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,800
feeding america's covet 19 response fund

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,879
for each completed response you will

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,519
also be contributing to local government

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
officials

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,400
understandings of the relative risks

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,280
posed by different technologies

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,760
we would also love your feedback on how

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,920
to recruit knowledgeable respondents

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,920
our efforts thus far to circulate the

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,679
survey through major professional

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
organizations in the cyber security

102
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,400
fields have not yielded

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,040
a large number of responses so we would

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,280
love to hear your ideas regarding how

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,679
and where to circulate the survey

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
so we can reach more pools of security

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
experts

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
if you have any questions feedback or

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
other thoughts don't hesitate to send me

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
an email

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
and also don't forget to fill out the

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
survey yourself your input

113
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,839
is very important to us thank you
