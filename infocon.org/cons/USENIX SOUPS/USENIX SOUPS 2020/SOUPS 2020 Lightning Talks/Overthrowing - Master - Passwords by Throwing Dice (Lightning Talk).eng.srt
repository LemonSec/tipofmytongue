00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,319
hi

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm stuart and i'm here to talk to you

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
about the tyranny

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,439
of master password password managers use

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,680
these so-called

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,720
master passwords to encrypt all of your

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
other passwords

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,919
as well as your two-factor

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,119
authentication codes and

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,880
other secrets and since password

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,400
managers promise to handle all this

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,238
information for us

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,399
many of us welcomed these master

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,320
passwords with open arms

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,320
but since master passwords are used as

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
encryption keys they must resist

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,800
offline guessing attacks so your master

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,680
password must be a genuinely

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,199
long random string you've never used

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
before

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,440
and yet if you forget this master

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,839
password you could lose everything

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,599
now most humans can learn such passwords

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
if given 30 training sessions but

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
password managers give you one shot and

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
you may still forget your master

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
password if you don't keep using it

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,360
frequently

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,439
in short users are being set up to fail

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
and they're being set up to take the

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,199
blame for that failure

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,119
so when you're asked to create a master

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
password you may find yourself wishing

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,040
you were on one of those game shows you

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
know

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
the ones where if you don't know the

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,080
right answer you can say

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,000
mark i'd like to take the physical

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,798
challenge instead

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,720
well if you're calling me mark i'd agree

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
you should avoid tasks requiring mental

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
acuity

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,039
why don't you take this nice pretty bag

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
of dice and shake them

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,720
it makes a nice rattling sound now roll

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,240
them into this box

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
messy but not game show messy

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,280
now put the lid on the box and lock the

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,280
dice permanently into place

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,520
oh that makes a pleasing sound that's

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,559
your key

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,880
keep it to yourself and don't lose it

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,880
look at all those letters and digits

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
now let's use this dice key with a

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
password manager when i'm asked for a

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
master password

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
i click on a link which takes me to the

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,359
dice keys app i scan my dice key

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
the app derives a master password from

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
it and i confirm that i want to send it

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
to the password manager

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
and when my master password is needed

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
again i can rederive it from my desk key

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
in the same way

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
other apps can also ask the dice keys

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,599
app to derive cryptographic secrets

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
you can use the same dice key because

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,640
the dice keys app won't reveal the dice

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
key itself

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
dice keys are kind of similar to

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
passwords in that you can read both dice

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,839
keys and passwords with your own eyes as

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
can anyone who tricks you into revealing

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
them

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
and while daze keys do require extra

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,480
hardware in return you get error checked

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
reading from physical media

78
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,879
a longer lasting storage medium and a

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,720
key that's really really hard to guess

80
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
in fact there are so many outcomes of

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
rolling a dice key

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
as many as there are atoms in thousands

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
of solar systems

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
and don't even think about trying to

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,920
build a computer that large because

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
spoiler alert

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,040
things will not end well so

88
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,720
perhaps the dice key is more similar to

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,840
the objects we typically think of as

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
security keys

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
they're also something you have and can

92
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,760
lose though taste keys aren't temper

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
proof or easy to attach to your car keys

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,359
they are something you can make a backup

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,079
of they don't have circuits that degrade

96
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,519
over time

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,239
and you'll be able to read them long

98
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
after usbc has gone the way of scuzzy

99
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
better to think of dice keys is

100
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,560
something you use rarely and can keep

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
somewhere safe

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
and those other keys is something you

103
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,679
carry every day and

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
you'll soon be able to use your dice key

105
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,159
to seed the keys you carry with you

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
including those made by solo keys so

107
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
that if you lose or break one

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,280
you can replace it with a cryptic

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,959
cryptographically identical replica

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
if you're a security researcher and

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,480
would like to study dice keys

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,159
we have a supply we can provide at no

113
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
cost so long as you will be sharing your

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
research at no cost

115
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,200
and you could investigate ways to

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,439
improve the usability of the hardware

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,599
or of the software as well as ways to

118
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,720
ensure ensure users understand the

119
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,280
product's risks

120
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
and can protect themselves from attacks

121
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
if you're interested

122
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
please drop me an email thanks for

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,359
watching and thanks to

124
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
everyone who has helped out with dice

125
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
keys

126
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,040
you
