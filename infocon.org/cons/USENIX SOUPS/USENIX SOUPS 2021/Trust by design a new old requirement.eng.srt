00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,400
hi my name is anna freira and i'm a

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,559
cyber security researcher at synthesis

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,320
at faculty of medicine of portland

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
portugal and this talk is entitled trust

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,920
by design a new world requirement

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
we know that current security solutions

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,519
are not enough to stop or minimize

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,519
attacks or avoid frequent interaction

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
mistakes pandemic did not bring new

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
attacks but as exacerbated existing ones

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
and exposed ongoing vulnerabilities and

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,640
risks that we face every day

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
the world has been experiencing one

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
pandemic wave after another and still

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
humanity seems to be focused on getting

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,200
back to normal pre-pandemic routines

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
only normal in hci means that privacy

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
and security were and still are one of

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
the biggest challenges in hci and normal

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,120
is also about low budget lack of

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
awareness lack of education or proper

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
infrastructures which are not adaptable

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
to different people or contexts ideal

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
literacy and education are essential

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,040
when well provided with online easy fast

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,119
accurate objective personalized

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,600
information because as much as we tend

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
to forget or ignore the unpredictable

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,000
nature of human behavior and actions

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
make the human the main enabler of the

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
level of cyber security each system can

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,000
and will have

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
but again this is not enough disruption

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
needs to happen at the core of human

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
devices interactions people have thrived

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,880
for thousands of years by successfully

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,799
trusting the tools they use and not

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,720
because they are experts or have full

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
knowledge of every tool why should

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
interactions with technology be

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,759
different

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
although i feared or subject in computer

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,640
science trust can happen online as

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
technology has a social presence to

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
which people respond to but research

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,600
fails to capture the reasons why trust

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
by design is required to support end

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,840
users in evaluating technology

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
trustworthiness help promoting its

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,840
proper use while minimizing the

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,240
frequency of security incidents thank

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,960
you very much for listening

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,119
you
