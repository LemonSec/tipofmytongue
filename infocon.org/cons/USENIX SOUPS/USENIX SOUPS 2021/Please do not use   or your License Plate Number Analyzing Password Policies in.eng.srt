00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,480
hi my name is eva gerlitz and i'm going

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,240
to give you a glimpse into our work

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,760
researching the current authentication

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
in german companies especially focusing

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
on the password policies and use

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,359
i worked on this with my co-authors

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,240
maximilian healing and matthew smith

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,599
when looking at authentication and

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,040
passwords there has been a lot of

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,120
research that for example focused on how

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
different policies impact the usability

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
and the security of the resulting

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
passwords there have also been studies

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
looking at specific elements of policies

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,120
for example how people care with

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,360
password exploration

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
in addition to science there are

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
organizations that give recommendations

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
to decision makers there is for example

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,960
the american nist which gives specific

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,760
advice on how policies should look like

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
there's also the german counterpart the

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,199
german federal office for information

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,840
security short psi

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
contraritionist their recommendations

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
are vague and decision makers need to

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,920
individually decide what sufficient and

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
appropriate means for their company or

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
use case

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
apart from policies there are also

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,560
efforts to move away from passwords

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
entirely and use techniques such as

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
biometrics or security keys

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
so with the context set we wondered how

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,479
the reality in companies actually looks

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
like to find an answer we conducted a

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,479
survey which we distributed over the

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,880
newsletter sent by the bsi we aimed for

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
the person responsible for

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
authentication in the company and

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
clearly stated this in the invitation

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
and at the beginning of the survey we

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,000
for example asked how employees

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
authenticate and how the password policy

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,240
looks like who created it and who or

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
what they were influenced by

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
the survey was answered by 83 people

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
out of the 83 participants 68 stated

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
that their company uses a company-wide

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
account per employee

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
all of them allow passwords for

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
authentication and we were able to

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,560
extract 64 password policies

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
10 participants mentioned biometric

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
authentication fingerprints face

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,479
recognition and palm vein recognition

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
and in 29 cases tokens can be used eight

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
companies offered all three methods and

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
two others mentioned to use device

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,879
certificates

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
if those companies offering more than

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,319
passwords 18 want the different methods

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,720
to be used as multiple factors in five

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
companies the employee can decide which

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,599
one to use

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,440
to give you an expression of the 64

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
policies and especially their diversity

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,519
the following graph shows the policies

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,959
based on the three main elements

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
mentioned by the bsi namely the minimum

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,160
length the maximum age and the number of

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
required character classes

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
it has to be noted that not all

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
participants mentioned every of these

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
elements and some also only gave an

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
unspecific rule such as a minimum length

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,519
must be fulfilled

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
the most common policy which was

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,280
mentioned by seven participants included

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
a complexity of three a minimal length

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,760
of eight characters and a rotation cycle

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,800
of 90 days displaying all policies we

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
can see the diversity but also common

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
features that were more popular than

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
others

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
for example a maximum password age of 90

87
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,840
days which was mentioned by 22

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
participants

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
or a minimum length of 8 characters

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,080
mentioned by 33 participants the

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
majority requires three character

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
classes to be used in the password and

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
we saw almost every combination

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
specifically requesting certain clauses

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
or accepting a password as long as any

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,799
three classes are included

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
around the third of the companies make

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
use of a maximum age and as a result 30

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
companies included a password history of

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,000
3 to 24 passwords that cannot be reused

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,319
15 companies even went one step further

102
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
and had a minimum age those ranged from

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
24 hours to 14 days

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
it has to be noted that the bsi

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
recommendations at the time of the study

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
included a regular password change

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
shortly after the study this was

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,319
adjusted and now the regular changes

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,920
might only be used if the passwords

110
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
cannot be checked against leaked ones

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
we also looked how satisfied the

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
participants were concerning the whole

113
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,439
authentication system and what

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,040
properties might influence a password

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
policy if you're interested in this i

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,159
would like to refer you to our paper

117
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,760
comparing the scene policies with

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
recommendations and findings from

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
related work we saw many with the

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
potential to be user unfriendly while

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
perhaps not even leading to secure

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
passwords the question remains why this

123
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
is the case and how to help decision

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
makers in general is the weakness of the

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
bsi recommendations practical is it good

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
to leave room for individual decisions

127
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
or is one recommendation like given

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
minus already sufficient for most cases

129
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
and considering the adjusted psi

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,280
recommendations what will happen in the

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
following years how and when will they

132
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,720
be applied

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
with these open questions i would like

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
to end my talk and thank you all for

135
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,360
listening i'm happy to answer your

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
questions

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,560
you
