hello everyone my name is jason and i

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,160
will be presenting our paper titled

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
concerned but ineffective user

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
perceptions methods and challenges when

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
sanitizing old devices for disposal

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
in this paper we look at the privacy

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
concerns surrounding when consumers

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,920
dispose of old devices modern electronic

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,000
devices have a short life cycle and are

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
frequently disposed of

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,760
to prevent data leaks and privacy

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
concerns devices should be sanitized

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,160
which means to remove personal data and

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,840
ensure there is a low probability of

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
recovery

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
in 2003 garfinkel and shellac found that

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
sensitive information can often be found

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,520
on disposed of hard drives

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
more recent research has found that this

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
to be the case for smartphones as well

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
we explore why users fail to properly

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
sanitize the device when disposing of

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
them

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,240
to holistically explore this we came up

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
with several research questions

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
first how do consumers dispose of their

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
old devices

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,040
next how do consumers prepare their

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
devices for disposal

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,200
and to answer the why we wanted to see

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
what barriers consumers face when trying

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,920
to sanitize their device

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
we answered these questions through an

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
online survey followed by

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
semi-structured interviews

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
more on the first two questions can be

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,479
found in the paper

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
garfinkel and chilap provide possible

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,040
explanations for why users fail to

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,880
sanitize their hard drives before

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
disposal

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
we examine these possible explanations

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,119
in light of our findings

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
we found evidence to support lack of

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,320
training

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
twelve participants simply deleted data

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
and five of these participants reported

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
it was the only sanitizing method known

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,159
to them

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,240
six participants reported not being able

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,479
to sanitize their device because they no

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
longer function or were broken in some

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
way

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
we observed that the widespread use of

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
manual deletion was coupled with the

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
misunderstanding that it was secure

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
sanitizing choice

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,239
we attribute this to tool error as the

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,080
prompts and many delete functions are

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,599
misleading to the average user

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
on the other hand we were unable to find

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,280
evidence for some of garfinkel and

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
schlatt's explanations

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,440
all participants seem to understand the

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
problem with leaving personal data on

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
the devices they are disposing of

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
also today sanitizing tools are widely

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,480
available and often built into different

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
operating systems

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
the issue doesn't appear to be a lack of

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,920
tools but more that their some of these

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,160
tools are difficult to access

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
for instance mac os requires users to

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
boot into recovery mode to find the disk

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,280
erase tools

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
through our semi-structured interviews

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
we identified other barriers to secure

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,879
sanitizing

79
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
first several participants complained of

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,319
what we call the side effects of

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
sanitizing while it might make sense to

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
zero fill a hard drive before selling it

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
if one did this to a hard drive in a

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
computer the computer is left without an

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
operating system

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
which can then impact the sale of the

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,120
device

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
we also saw this with cameras where the

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
most secure method was to remove the

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
memory card but then the purchaser

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
wouldn't be able to use the device until

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,440
they bought a new memory card

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,519
other participants complained of a slow

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,239
sanitizing process in the case of this

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,560
participant they couldn't even complete

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
their insecure method of sanitizing as

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
it took so long

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,319
seven of the 12 participants that

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,560
manually deleted data reported missing

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
some of their data such as browsing

101
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
history saved passwords or application

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,839
credentials

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,159
lastly we provide some suggestions to

104
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,920
the relevant stakeholders to improve

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,480
device sanitizing practices

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
for device and operating system

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
manufacturers we suggest rectifying any

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,280
misleading prompts and ensure that users

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
have access to the relevant information

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
on the built-in tools at the right

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
moment rather than having to find it

112
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519
buried on a support website

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
for retailers or anywhere that accepts

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,079
second-hand devices provide policies to

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
ensure that the consumer is clear on who

116
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
is sanitizing the device and what

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
happens to the device once it is dropped

118
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
off

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,360
for recyclers increase consumer

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
awareness for secure sanitizing to make

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
consumers more likely to recycle their

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
devices

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
and for researchers a tool can be

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
developed

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
that can recognize when the user is

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
preparing a device for disposal such as

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
when they're deleting many files and

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
nudge the user to properly sanitize it

129
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
instead

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
in conclusion our work sheds light on

131
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,479
why personal data is left on disposed of

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,759
devices

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,520
please see the paper for more on the

134
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
different disposal and sanitizing

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
methods

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,479
how users sanitize non-functioning

137
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
devices and user perceptions and

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
misconceptions when sanitizing devices

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,800
thank you for listening
