00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,920
hello my name is christian schransky

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,840
from latins university arnoffa in

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
germany and today i will present you our

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,920
work on the limited impact of

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
visualizing encryption perceptions of

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
end-to-end messaging security okay

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
let me start with a little story

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,320
something that we've encountered

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
ourselves pretty often and that you

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
might encounter this well previously is

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
that you're talking to someone via

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
whatsapp or signal

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
and ask them to send you some sensitive

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
information like a password

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
and instead of staying within the

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
currently endpoint encrypted messenger

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
the other person decides to send you

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
this information through a text message

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
or via email or they want to call you

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,520
and i've been wondering is this a common

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
use case that people switch from their

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,680
end-to-end encrypted messenger to

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
something that is only transport

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
encrypted like for example a text

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,000
message

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
and is it the case

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,720
can we stop people from switching from a

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,759
secure tool to something less secure

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,840
so to find out if

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
this is actually the case we conducted

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,200
fat studies on mturk and prolific

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
and the first study was to find out

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
which tools people are using for the

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
day-to-day conversations and for

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
sensitive conversations

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
and in the second to four study we

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,240
tested several texts icons and

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,960
animations to see if we could

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
improve perceptions of security and

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,079
privacy

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
and lastly we conducted a validation

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,079
study to confirm our results on a

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
different platform okay starting with

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
the tool usage study we asked

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,920
participants which tools they preferred

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,680
for day-to-day conversations as well as

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
sensitive conversations

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
and as we can see in the pictures the

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
most common use was a text message and

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
facebook messenger for daily

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,159
conversations

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,759
and this pictures changed a lot for

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
sensitive conversations because people

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
said that they would be preparing email

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
or text message to

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,640
send sensitive information

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
and even the end-to-end encrypted

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
messengers dropped a lot

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
so we found out that those switches do

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
indeed happen

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
and so what can we do now for the

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
following surveys we decided to use

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,440
mturk as a platform again

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
and we only wanted to reach whatsapp

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
users with our survey so we decided to

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
create a qualification task where we

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
asked uh participants

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
which messengers they are using as well

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800
as which smartphone operating system

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
they are using for the three following

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
studies we used screencasts with a

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,640
fixtures whatsapp update and a

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
conversation with sensitive content for

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
the text disclosure study we use six

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
different text variants and a control

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
condition

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
for example one of these messages was

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,080
messages to this chat are now encrypted

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
or messages to sit on our entrant

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
encrypted

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
and we found out that the simple

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,280
messages to shed on our encrypted

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
condition was the most successful and

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
our changes had no impact on usability

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,280
and satisfaction how i can study we used

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
three different icons a closed letter a

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,120
shield and a log all of them had a

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
slight negative effect on our

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
participants

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,440
our fourth study were three different

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
animations the first one being

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,519
disappearing messages which is normally

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,280
not a security feature however

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,599
participants in our first study reported

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,480
that they liked snapchat because

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,120
messages were just gone after they

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
disappeared and so we decided to just

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
include it as animation as well because

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
we hoped it could improve security

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
perceptions

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,319
and the second condition was that we

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
used the scrambling texts so

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,319
text was scrambled before it was shown

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,640
to them after receiving

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,720
and the third one was a progress cycle

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
that

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,239
built before showing the text to the

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
participants

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
however none of those factors were

110
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
significant however the progress circle

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
had a weak positive effect towards

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,360
perceived trust security and privacy

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
and the animations again did not impact

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,478
usability or satisfaction our last study

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
was a validation study due to the

116
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
inconclusive findings we had in study

117
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
for and

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
the bad data quality that we had in

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
study for as you can see we had 52

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
attention checks that failed in the

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
animation study we decided to use

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
prolific as a different platform to get

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
a different

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
example

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
furthermore we decided to rename our

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,840
messenger to erebus to reduce the impact

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
of the name

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
that the messenger has

129
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
and we try to get more qualitative data

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
so that we added more open text

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
questions and our results confirm our

132
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
previous results from study2 to 4 that

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
any visualization is better than none

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
a lot of participants also mentioned

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
that the reputation of the application

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
is really important one participant for

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
example said honestly i guess i just

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
trust in the brand that it's safe i do

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
this through the popularity good press

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
and confidence in their service

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,160
and with that i would like to conclude

142
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,280
my talk and thank you for your intention
