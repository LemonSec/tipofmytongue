00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,800
hi my name is dan hastings today we're

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,000
going to look at solitude which is an

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
open source privacy analysis tool you

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,599
can use solitude to inspect your

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
favorite mobile and web applications to

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,199
see where the data that you put into

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,039
these applications goes when you use the

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,000
apps

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
solitude has a couple different ways of

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,279
running and configuring which you can

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,199
look at on our github today we're just

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,880
going to take a look at a mobile web

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
application and see how

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,280
it's used with solitude

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
we're using the strava app there aren't

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
any known privacy issues with strava

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,320
we're just using strava because it's a

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
good example and it has lots of

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
different types of data that it collects

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,360
and uses within the app

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
so when you boot the app you can see in

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,879
the background the different types of

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
data that either comes searches that

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,480
come built in such as internal ip

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
addresses or

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
different types of data we've configured

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
to search for within solitude

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
such as that's dynamic that we've put in

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,480
as we use the app

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,479
so one example of that is we're going to

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
take a look at the profile here and

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
we're going to add in the city that this

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
user is from

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,600
already pre-configured this but while

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
you're using the app you can actually do

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
this in solitude and you can go into the

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
configuration settings here and add any

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,320
different types of data you want to

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
search for as use the app

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,399
so

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,560
in this case we're looking at the city

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,759
herndon which we've titled our hometown

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
we're going to close the settings and

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
then as we save the profile we can see

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
that the city heard on the hometown is

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
being sent to strava.com

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
we've given the permission of

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
our contacts

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
accessed strava access to our contacts

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
and so we created a fake contact which

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
we're going to then see if that contact

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
that fake contact in our contact list on

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
our phone is being sent anywhere and

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,240
solitude has found that it's being sent

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
to strava.com

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
lastly when we foreground the app

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,119
one of the built-in searches that comes

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,880
with solitude is looking for gps

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,920
coordinates

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
and we can see that the gps coordinates

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,799
are being shared with mapbox.com

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
and that's a quick tech demo on how

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
solitude works

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
if you have any questions if you want to

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,720
