1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,560
in this presentation i'll be discussing

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
the work the thing doesn't have a name

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
learning from emerging real world

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
interventions in smart home security

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,480
which was completed with colleagues at

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,800
delta university of technology

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,279
being brennan elsa carlos and michelle

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
regarding the aims of the work it

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
remains that many iot devices have

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,920
technical vulnerabilities or

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,719
misconfigurations such as default

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,120
passwords which expose a range of

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
consumer iot devices to

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
potential malware infections such as

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,960
with mirai a typical fix is for internet

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
service providers or isps to send clean

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,280
up instructions to owners of suspected

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
infected iot devices

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
however little is known about what takes

20
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,119
place in place in end users homes after

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
receiving this remediation advice they

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
may not be able to confirm which device

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
is infected

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
or even after following instructions

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
prove removal of the malware

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
we coordinated with a partner isp to

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
conduct remote think allowed

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,080
observations with 17 of their customers

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,759
who had a suspected infected device

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,840
where observations focus on answering

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,159
the question how do end users act on

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,400
remediation advice about their infected

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
internet of things devices

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
the methodology first required

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,360
identifying infected users

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
by combining network data that provided

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
the ip addresses of customers matching

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,119
the mirai malware scan signature

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
those customers were then notif uh

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
notified

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
of the mirai infection

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,680
and received uh instructions for

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,119
remediation

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
as as well as notification of the study

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
so those who

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,959
signaled interest were

47
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
then participated in i think allowed

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
interview calls

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
which stepped through a consent check

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
and then

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
um the actual think allowed protocol

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,879
where they were asked to perform the

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,720
steps on their own without any

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
interference

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,760
the

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
resultant calls were then

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
transcribed and coded to form our

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,640
analysis and outcomes

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,360
these outcomes indicated that

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
users our participants were highly

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
motivated to

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
remediate

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
and resolve the problem but advice was

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,480
constrained in many ways only four or 17

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
participants successfully completed all

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,120
five remediation steps where these

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
included changing of

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
credentials and resetting of devices

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
participants were relying on

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
a range of heuristics some would

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,959
use a process of elimination amongst

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,560
their devices

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
or start with a device which

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,959
they regarded as already having problems

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,599
or otherwise independent searching aside

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
from the notification instructions

77
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,560
without a dedicated app or interface

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
which three participants were able to

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
find others

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
sought those kind of features but found

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,200
them difficult to find or

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,799
otherwise

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
fell back on family behaviors if they

84
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
were not able to

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,000
find a feature to change a password or

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
reset the device so they they may unplug

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
the device or turn it

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
off and turn it back on again

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
and so then

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,519
the remediation process was cumbersome

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,480
and it

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
it wasn't necessarily

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,159
indicating that it had succeeded but yet

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
many participants reached a successful

95
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
outcome however three participants had

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
devices which indicated in the data that

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,120
they

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
um there were infections remaining but

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
they'd followed some of the

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
same steps that remediated users had so

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,478
um

102
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,440
this

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,320
this

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,279
is a is a call for um looking further

105
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,560
into these problems and so we saw here a

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,880
kind of action diffraction where users

107
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,040
were not able to do enough

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
toward remediation they would try

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
behaviors which

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
they were able to do

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
which were not necessarily

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
directly successful so behaviors that

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
had a good chance of success but we're

114
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
not definitely going to succeed or even

115
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,639
be confirmed as having been successful

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,759
we're here

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
this is indicated by

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
highly motiva highly motivated

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
users on the at the top left there

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,919
with these arrows these dotted arrows

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,199
indicating that they would try many

122
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,800
different things they could activate

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
these behaviors

124
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
but

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,639
the

126
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
target behavior was kind of indistinct

127
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
as to what exactly it was so they they

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,919
may hit the mark

129
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
or

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,759
something close to it but then not even

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
necessarily have it confirmed

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
so that concludes this overview of our

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
work thank you for your attention and

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,039
comments and questions are welcome
