1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,480
hello everybody so the talk of the day

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
will be about consent for third party

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
tracking which as you know might be

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,279
quite a pricing basis practice but the

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,039
thing with that topic is it also

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,119
encompasses both aspects of computer

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
sciences for the technical part of the

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
analysis and also um aspects of law so

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
the regulatory aspect of it and that's

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
the reason why we've teamed up together

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,960
with copyrighted men like many other

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
co-authors that are mentioned

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,719
to look at that issue from a very

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
interdisciplinary perspective

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,520
so

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
the team conhad is computer scientist

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,280
team and we're very happy to present

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
very briefly some of the uh

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
the outline of our research

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,079
so the first uh question that we were

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
wondering was just do you actually need

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,760
consent because people talk about

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
consent quite a lot and usually consent

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
is seen as really the golden standard

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,799
and that's something that you should

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
achieve uh when you're tracking and yeah

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,880
content is essentially you know

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
everywhere on the web right

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
well yeah exactly and that's that's part

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
of the solution and and i would agree

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
actually as a lawyer i would say consent

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
is probably the only viable option that

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
you have and the reason for that is um

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
yeah it's combined reason actually

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,080
because you have the deep privacy

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
directive that people might know about

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,320
already that says that if you want to

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,640
actually access or store data on the

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
user's device which you definitely do

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
when you are engaging in dirt by

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,079
tracking

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
essentially consent so there is there is

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
actually very little way around that

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,280
when you're actually accessing storing

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
data

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
and that's the reason why consent is

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
really one of the most important

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
option that you have when it comes to

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
tracking and what about what about gdpr

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
you know the massive privacy law in the

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
eu yeah gdpr is definitely relevant as

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
well um and gdpr also lays down rules

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
about the actual validity of the consent

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
and the actual lawfulness as well but

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
there would be a bit much for today's

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
talk so uh yeah if you're interested i

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,119
would really encourage you to read the

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
paper because we detailed that there uh

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
but the short answer is consent is

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,440
mandatory that's mostly due to uh the

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
privacy but what we're most interested

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
in was really the absence or uh the

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
presence and you'll tell us

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
that now of consense mechanism in apps

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
so whether there was any kind of

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,720
consensus mechanism implemented there

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
yeah yeah sure um so what we did to

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,319
learn about the presence of concept

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,400
mechanisms and apps is

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
uh

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,239
a

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,360
representative sample from the

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,519
google play store of 1 300 apps

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,440
and we opened every single one of these

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
apps

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
looked at whether these apps ask for

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
consent and at the same time we

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
monitored their network traffic and um

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,360
analyzed well where does data go to what

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,959
companies

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
and what we found is that while more

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,519
than 70 percent of apps

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
send data to

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
uh tracking companies and that's even

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,239
before any user interaction

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
um well even before clicking on the

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,680
accept button for instance you know you

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
just you just you know you just open it

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,680
and your data goes out there to facebook

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
google

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,720
many other companies right at the start

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,080
yes that's right and well less than 9.9

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
percent of apps actually ask users for

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,360
consent

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
so that's a huge discrepancy that's that

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,799
that's quite worrying you need

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,720
especially since we didn't look at the

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,239
quality of the consent as well so we

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
just look at whether there was any

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,720
type of affirmative action required by

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
the user of the app not even whether

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,280
they were sufficiently informed clicking

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,799
accept for instance so that's also

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
another another issue yeah well actually

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,159
only 3.5 percent of apps

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,280
allow users to refuse consent otherwise

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
apps would just quit so that you know

108
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
which is which is really worrying

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,959
actually and

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,280
app developers even supported in the in

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
their efforts in implementing consent

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
for instance or are they left or on

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
their own uh without without any kind of

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
guidance as to how to do it um yeah well

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
what we did is look at 13 um trackers

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
and their online guidance to just find

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,918
out well

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,120
why do

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,440
developers and so much numbers don't do

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
the right thing don't uh you know

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
fulfill the legal requirements and what

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
we found is that the

123
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,919
guidance provided by trackers was just

124
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,680
you know

125
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,320
[Music]

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
while very mixed

127
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,720
we found lots of outdated or broken

128
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
information as you can see from the

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,440
slide

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
with you know google facebook other

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
companies

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
um so overall just not a pleasant

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,639
experience of

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,840
trying to implement content

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
to tracking in apps

136
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
so wrapping up now um it doesn't look

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
very bright right because while consent

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
is actually necessary it's not really uh

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
done in practice there is no incentive

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
very few uh and if you're motivated to

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
actually implement any kind of consents

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
well the guidance that you'll find is

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
actually very scarce and not really

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
available or even accessible

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,759
so it's kind of a dark picture isn't it

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
well you know i think it's changing but

147
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,120
you know change is slow

148
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,599
you
