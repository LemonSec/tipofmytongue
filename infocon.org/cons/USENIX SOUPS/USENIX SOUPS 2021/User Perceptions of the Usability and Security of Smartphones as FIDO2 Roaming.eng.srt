00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,760
hi

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,520
i'm kentrell owens from the university

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,680
of washington i'll be talking to you

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,320
about user perceptions of usability and

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
security of smartphones and spido 2

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
roaming authenticators which is work

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,558
from my internship at duo security

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,800
passwords the most common authentication

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,680
methods

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,440
have many weaknesses for online

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
authentication for example most data

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
breaches are caused by weak or reused

13
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,760
passwords

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,920
researchers and practitioners have tried

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
to develop schemes that are more secure

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
than passwords yet no harder to use

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
one of the most compelling alternatives

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,760
is the fido 2 standard which aims to

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
replace passwords with public key

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
cryptography for authentication on the

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,800
web

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
users can authenticate in one of two

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,680
ways

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
with platform auth indicators users

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
authenticate to the trusted hardware on

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,680
the same device on which they are

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,520
accessing a website

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,760
for example they can use their phone's

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
touch id to authenticate

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
however they must re-register for each

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,960
website separately on each device

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,759
basically each of the user users devices

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
creates its own public private key pair

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,759
with roaming off indicators however they

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
would only need to register once because

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
the roaming auth indicator itself will

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
store the key pair

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,119
to date though roaming authenticators

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,280
have typically taken the form of a usb

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
security key

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,119
however users might not be willing to

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
pay for a usb security key carry it

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
around or figure out how to plug it into

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
different devices

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
these drawbacks have driven recent

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
efforts to enable smartphones to serve

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
as roaming authenticators that is you

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,159
can use your smartphone to log into

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,719
websites on all of your devices the use

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
of smartphones is 502 roaming

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
authenticators is the focus of our

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,719
research

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,199
google security has been experimenting

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
with a software-based mobile

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,959
authenticator that we call neo

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
in short the neo prototype lets you use

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
your existing smartphone as a 502

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,440
roaming authenticator

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
we compared user perceptions of neo

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,879
relative to passwords through user study

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
97 mechanical turk participants were

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
assigned to use either neo on their own

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
smartphone or a password to log into a

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
fictitious bank ten times over two weeks

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
we studied several research questions

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
our summarize i'll summarize our

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
findings for each

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
first how difficult did participants

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
find neo's initial setup

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
participants found set up to be quite

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
difficult

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
over half of neo participants dropped

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,120
out during setup compared to 10 percent

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
of passports participants

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
and even after completing setup neo

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
participants waited the process

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
as significantly less usable on the

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,360
system usability scale compared to

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
passwords participants

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
next we examine usability quantitatively

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
in day-to-day authentication

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
while fido 2 conceptually has many

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
usability benefits passwords often

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
outperform neo in our study

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
passwords participants were more likely

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
to be successful at locking in the neo

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
participants

88
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
password participants took less time to

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
authenticate than neo participants

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
and password participants were also more

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,080
likely to rate signing in as easy

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
we then examined participants

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
perceptions of neo's security and

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,518
usability related to passwords

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,879
in terms of user perceptions neo fared

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,640
better than passwords

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,920
all neo participants felt neo was secure

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
over half of neo participants said they

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
were likely or very likely to use neo

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
over passwords for five of the six

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
account types we asked about

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,840
however

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
passwords still received a higher system

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
usability skill score than neo at the

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,279
end of the study

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,319
finally given neo's important security

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,080
benefits and potential usability

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
benefits relative to passwords we

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,839
investigated barriers to its adoption

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
neo participants were concerned about

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,960
having their phones available when they

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
hoped to log in

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
a third of participants reported

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,479
misplacing their phones daily they also

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,360
worried about account recovery

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
summarize we found that participants

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
accurately recognized neo-security

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,560
benefits over passwords however despite

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,800
neo's conceptual usability benefits

120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
participants found neo substantially

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
less usable than passwords both in

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,800
objective quantitative measures and in

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
perception

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,639
to spur neo's adoption stressing

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
security benefits thus may not be enough

126
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
smartphones introduce new challenges

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
relative to usb security keys including

128
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,720
running out of battery poor reception

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,199
and being a high value target for theft

130
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
nonetheless our study highlights key

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
opportunities for spurring adoption of

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,759
smartphones as 502 runway authenticators

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,000
thank you
