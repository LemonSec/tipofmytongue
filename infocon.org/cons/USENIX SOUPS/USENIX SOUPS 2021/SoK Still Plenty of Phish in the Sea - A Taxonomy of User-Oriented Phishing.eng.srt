1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
welcome to my talk on our research paper

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,960
is still plenty of fish in the sea

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
my name is anjali funds and i will

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
present a taxonomy of user-oriented

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
fishing interventions and avenues for

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,880
future research

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,720
phishing is a cyber attack that is used

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,800
to get hold of users information or to

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
distribute malware

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,719
to facilitate user's phishing detection

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
prior research has developed a number of

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
user-oriented interventions against

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,399
phishing attacks

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
since those studies are fragmented

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,559
across a diverse research landscape it

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
is challenging to gain an overview of

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,520
what has already been investigated

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,360
in our article we make an attempt to

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
systematize prior research works

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
first we aim to explore how current

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
research tackles the aim of guiding

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,399
users towards secure online behavior

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
second we intend to highlight promising

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
avenues for future research

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
to do so we conducted a systematic

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
literature review the search term

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
consisted of fish as well as the

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
plurality of intervention types such as

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
training detection or nudges

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,680
our initial data collection consisted of

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
more than 2000 articles and after

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
several rounds of screening our final

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,799
sample consists of 64 articles

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
we analyzed the sample with respect to

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
several aspects and i will now present

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,040
three of those in detail

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
first we raised the question how can

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
user-oriented phishing interventions be

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
taxonomized

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
from our literature sample we have

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
derived four categories and ten

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
subcategories

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
we distinguish between education

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
interventions which aim to develop

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
knowledge and understanding of phishing

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,240
threats

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
training interventions typically involve

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
some kind of hands-on practice for

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,799
example no fish is a serious game app

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
that trains users how to recognize

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
fishing urls

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
embedded training is based on phishing

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
simulations and trains users right after

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
they just fell for an attack

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
third we found awareness-raising

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
interventions which warn users about

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
potentially dangerous content

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
we found those that require user

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
interactivity such as torpedo which

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
deactivates links for several seconds

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
and passive warnings lastly we found a

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,680
variety of design interventions such as

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
highlighting the domain in the address

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
bar

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,879
you can find a full description of our

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
taxonomy in our paper

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
we found that several interventions

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
employ techniques from more than one

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,640
category for example awareness raising

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,959
interventions that also aim to educate

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,200
the user

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
second we analyzed which phishing attack

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
vector the interventions address

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
several interventions address the

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
phishing message itself for example by

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
educating the user about influence

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
techniques

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
more than half of all interventions

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,959
focus on url recognition

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,480
others focus on the detection of

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
fraudulent websites or login forms but

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
only very few articles address malware

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,879
or mobile applications as fishing

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
threads

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
lastly we have a look at when the

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
intervention takes place

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
on the left we find pre-decision

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,159
interventions mostly education and

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
training which also often address

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
phishing in a broader sense

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
on the right we can see embedded

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
training interventions that take place

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
post decision and mostly focus on the

94
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
email message and you are a

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,319
url recognition

96
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
for during decision interventions we see

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
that many awareness raising and design

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
interventions have been investigated but

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239
they have rarely been enriched with

100
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,319
educational or training approaches we

101
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,640
see only very few orange and green dots

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
here

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
based on our literature review and

104
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,400
several meta-analysis by other authors

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
we have identified the following areas

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
to be of particular interest for future

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
research

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
first we have seen that many

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
interventions require quite a lot of

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
users time and effort

111
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
in a real world scenario this time and

112
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
effort will add up and cause both

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,319
distraction and frustration

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
future research should therefore focus

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
on finding effective interventions while

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
minimizing user effort and intrusiveness

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
second rick wash who is also in the

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
session has highlighted the importance

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,199
of shifting users cognitive frame when

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,639
handling email

121
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
when making sense of an email they need

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
to actively shift into an investigation

123
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,400
frame to be able to apply rules and

124
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
anything they might have learned

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,479
beforehand to detect phishing however

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
research works of the last three years

127
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,080
have mostly focused on how to trend

128
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
users pre-decision

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
this focus should be shifted towards

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,520
during decision intervention such as

131
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
warnings or digital nudges to support

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
users in situ

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
third getting back to digital nudges

134
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
phishing research has rarely explored

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
their potential to date

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
we think that facilitating reinforcing

137
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
or even fear appeal nudges might be

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
promising approaches potentially

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
enriched with educational elements

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
lastly we have seen that member attacks

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,479
have not really received any attention

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
in research so far

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
since the action of downloading and

144
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
opening an infected

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,639
attachment is quite different to

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,800
clicking on a link future interventions

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
should start to investigate

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
user-oriented anti-malware interventions

149
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
we hope that our work can serve as a

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
starting point for both novel and

151
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,400
experienced researchers to gain an

152
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
overview of the research area and to

153
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,600
identify relevant paths for future works

154
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
thank you very much i am looking forward

155
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
to the discussion and i'd be very happy

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
to connect with you via email or

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,360
linkedin afterwards
