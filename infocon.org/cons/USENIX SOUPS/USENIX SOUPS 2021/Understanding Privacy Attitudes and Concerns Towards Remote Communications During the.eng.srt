00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,119
hi and thank you for joining my talk i'm

2
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,439
paddy salami naini a postdoctoral

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,199
scholar at university of washington

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,800
today i'm going to talk about our

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,039
research on exploring people's privacy

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,439
attitudes and concerns toward remote

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,599
communications during the kobe 19

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,000
pandemic this is a joint work in my

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,399
colleagues tiana francisco yoshi kono

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
and francie rosener at university of

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,320
washington

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
since late december 2019 and early

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
january 2020 the word was hit by the

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,079
kobe 19 pandemic caused by a virus

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,680
to prevent the spread of the virus

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,520
people around the world started using

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,320
conferencing tools to work socialize and

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,680
learn from home

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
these tools however exposed users to a

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,440
wide range of privacy and security risks

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
we launched our online survey on may

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
2020 and recruited 220 participants we

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,400
sought to conduct our survey during the

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,880
transition phase of the pandemic then

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
participants were still adjusting to the

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
remote settings by remembering their

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
normal lives before the pandemic

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
our survey covers three countries of

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
remote communications work from home

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
learning from home and socializing from

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
home in each context we leverage

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
participants open-ended responses to a

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
surface that unbiased privacy and

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
security attitudes towards three aspects

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
of remote communications conferencing

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
tools modes of remote communication such

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
as microphone and webcam and locations

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,439
of remote communications for example

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,000
bedroom or living room

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,079
we conducted quantitative and

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
qualitative analysis to answer three

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
research questions

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
how do people engage with different

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,479
aspects of remote communications how do

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,880
privacy and security factor into

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
people's behaviors and attitudes toward

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
these aspects and what approaches can be

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,799
used to effectively inform and empower

49
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,878
users privacy and security decision

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,440
making related to remote communications

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
for the rest of this talk i will briefly

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
go over a few findings and if you're

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,120
interested in learning more about this

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
topic i encourage you to take a look at

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
our paper

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
accidental exposures of audio and video

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
can lead to privacy violations to raise

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
users risk awareness and avoid such

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
incidents from happening

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
we need to understand the underlying

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
reasons for participants preferences

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,879
over different modes of remote

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,120
communications our participants

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
expressed lack of agency over sharing

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
your audio and video in the remote

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
meeting even when being concerned a

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
participant said

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
if the manager asked me to turn on the

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
video i have to do it but i personally

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
prefer to maintain it switched off at

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,319
all times

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
several participants reported to select

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
a meeting location which they perceived

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
to be the most private in their homes a

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
participant said

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
i'm concerned about my co-workers seeing

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
my space the kitchen is the least

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
personal place in the house to have such

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,319
meetings

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
our participants voted their employers

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,959
and educators listen to their concerns

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,519
and accordingly provide meeting policies

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,920
that answer these questions what

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
conferencing tools should be used and

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
why what privacy and security controls

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
are provided by the tool in what

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
conditions are users required to

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,080
activate their microphone and webcam and

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
how can users manage their concerns and

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,360
discomfort with the tools

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
tool developers could do more to protect

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
people's privacy in their remote

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
communications

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
to manage privacy from other meeting

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
attendees some participants reported to

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,760
be using virtual backgrounds however

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
several participants reported to not

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
have access to this much needed feature

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
which could be added in the future

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
and to preserve privacy from other

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
household members especially in crowded

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,879
settings future tools can be enabled

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,360
with a feature to detect and notify the

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
user whether other household members are

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
in the hearing range of your remote

106
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
meetings

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,000
in this work we learned about people's

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
privacy and security attitudes over demo

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
communications during the pandemic

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
however this is not a history paper in a

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,840
recent gallup survey 17 of americans

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,800
reported that they will still prefer to

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
work from home even after the

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
restrictions are lifted this indicates

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
that remote communications is going to

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
last much longer than the pandemic

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
itself

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
going forward our community including

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
researchers software developers and

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,759
policy makers need to continue to learn

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
from users experience with remote

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
communications and work toward informing

123
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
and empowering their privacy and

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
security related decision making as they

125
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
interact with the conferencing tools i'm

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
pardesa maminaini and thank you very

127
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,919
much for your attention
