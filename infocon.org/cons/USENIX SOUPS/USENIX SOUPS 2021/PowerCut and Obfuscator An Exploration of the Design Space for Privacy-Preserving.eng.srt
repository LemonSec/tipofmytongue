00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,000
presenting our work titled powercut and

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
obfuscator an exploration of the design

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,279
space for privacy preserving

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,279
interventions for voice assistants

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
this is joint work with suman belgae

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
kasim all from the university of

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,039
wisconsin

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,960
voices are pervasive in american

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
households as of 2020 nearly 20 million

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
households had one

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
voice assistance are commonly used for

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,800
many household tasks including home

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,920
automation

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,200
interaction with various third-party

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,440
applications

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,000
and often as an information bank

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,079
voice assistants also have other uses

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,920
ranging from playing music to creating

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
lists

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
voice assistants however introduced

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
several privacy issues

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
there's widespread coverage of how

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,800
amazon's alexa accidentally records

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
conversations

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,159
recently google and his home assistant

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
were sued for privacy violations and the

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,479
same for amazon's alexa

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
these are broadly categorized as passive

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,920
privacy threats due to the accidental

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
nature of the recording

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
recent academic works have demonstrated

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
how an adversarial entity can embed

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,360
vocal commands in in the inaudible

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,320
spectrum

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,600
these are broadly known as active

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,040
threads

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,880
in our work we wish to understand how a

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,400
privacy preserving intervention against

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
such threats ought to be designed

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
there are several solutions to preserve

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,880
u.s user privacy

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,400
one could intercept the network traffic

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
from the voice assistant and prevent

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,759
leakage of sensitive information

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,360
one could also modify the hardware to

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,880
ensure that the behavior is privacy

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,159
preserving

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,840
a simple solution involves changing the

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
wake word to avoid accidental

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,159
activations or the hail mary solution is

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,119
simply discarding smart speaker

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
the first approach however is

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,960
unintuitive for the common user

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
additionally it is still susceptible to

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,399
both forms of threats

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,159
finally dealing with encrypted traffic

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,079
is tricky

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,759
the second approach largely has the same

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,759
issues is the first

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
changing the wake word is simple to do

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,160
however it does not protect the user

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,599
or the smart speaker from active threads

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
finally discarding the smart speaker is

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,879
a non-utilitarian private solution

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
to better understand how an intervention

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
ought to be observed that the smart

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,080
speaker is capable of processing speak

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
from any direction

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
based on interactions with end users we

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,040
understand that the privacy metaphor

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
that they relate to is that of a virtual

73
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
veil this can be thought of as a

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
mechanism that shrouds the smart speaker

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
rendering it ineffective

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
this can be realized in two simple ways

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
first mechanism can be developed to

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,480
disrupt the power supply to the smart

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
speaker rendering it ineffective

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,040
alternatively one can design a mechanism

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
to ensure that the user's speech is

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
drowned by another sequel this renders

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
the smart speaker useless as well

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,800
concretely we utilize disengaging power

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,519
using a remote control outlet

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,840
and jam out the user's command using a

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,280
remote control device that generates

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
human inaudible ultrasound the

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
ultrasound however is audible to

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
microphones and smart speakers

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
these are prototypes whose primary aim

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
is to elicit feedback about different

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
design dimensions

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
they have various pros and cons

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
but the commonality is that when engaged

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
they provably protect the end user's

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
privacy

98
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,280
we compare these prototypes the inbuilt

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
baseline the new button

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,640
to achieve our goal of gaining insight

101
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,159
about the design dimensions of privacy

102
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,000
preserving interventions we follow a

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
tech probe approach we utilize the

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
university mailing list to recruit

105
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
participants from around the campus

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
in total we recruit 30 participants from

107
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,000
24 families

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,599
each of these participants were paid 40

109
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,200
dollars to participate in our irb

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
approved study

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
our study spanned two years we conducted

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
an initial set of interviews in 2018

113
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
another set in 2019 when the adoption of

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,519
smart speakers increased along with the

115
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
privacy concerns about them

116
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,560
the data was transcribed encoded by two

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
coders independently the outcome of the

118
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
coding process is described in our paper

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,080
along with other details about the

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
experimental setup i strongly encourage

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,200
you to read about it

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,358
through our analysis we discovered

123
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,639
several important themes that are

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
important to end users

125
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,080
a privacy preserving intervention should

126
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
have the following properties

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
should be aesthetically appealing and

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
integrate with existing decor

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
it should also provide a relatable

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
privacy metaphor like the virtual wheel

131
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
we propose

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
its state of operation must be clear

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
through an led indicator

134
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
it should be cheap and should be cheaper

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
than the smart speaker in particular

136
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,479
this is important when the user has

137
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
multiple smart speakers at home

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
should be easier to deploy and easier

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
fix when things don't work the way they

140
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,919
should

141
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,680
privacy protection should be its

142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
secondary functionality notice that the

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
intervention here is part of a test

144
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
light

145
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
it also help the intervention came from

146
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
an organization which is different than

147
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
the smart speaker manufacturer

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
finally people prefer hands-free

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
interaction with the intervention and

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
expect fine grain per user privacy

151
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,080
control

152
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
achieving some of these properties is

153
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
the subject of future work

154
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,280
thank you for listening i'm looking

155
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,638
forward to any questions you may have

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
