particularly given all the you know

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,000

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
to start let me just mention uh up front

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
that this topic is is uh on a

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,439
challenging and often emotionally

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,400
exhausting

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,359
topic

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
uh we'll be discussing abuse physical

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
and sexual violence harassment

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,360
etc

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,640
so you know please take care of

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,079
yourselves

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,399
feel free to turn it off or take a break

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480
in the middle of talk

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,079
with that let me just start by providing

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
some brief background on intimate

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,320
partner violence which is just a really

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
gigantic you know social ill

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
a relatively recent survey run by the

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,680
cdc in the us indicates that about one

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
out of four women and more than one out

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
of 10 men will at some point in their

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,479
lives suffer from physical violence rape

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,560
and or stalking by their husband wife

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
boyfriend girlfriend or other form of

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
intimate partner

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,560
historically ipv has fallen under the

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
term domestic violence

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
and often the terms end up being used

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
sort of interchangeably

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
but over time there's been an increasing

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
realization that the traditional focus

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
on kind of heteronormative husband-wife

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
relationships in the home

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
and physical violence doesn't aptly

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
characterize the pattern of controlling

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,439
behavior by an abuser

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
to establish power and control over

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
their partner

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,119
this can include intrusive monitoring of

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,119
a partner threats of violence demands

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
about how they dress isolation tactics

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
such as controlling who they socialize

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,680
with repeated put down sexual coercion

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
and and so much more

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,439
and survivors really routinely report

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
that such abuse

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
is uh you know can be even more painful

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
and debilitating than physical violence

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,240
so ultimately abuse is about power and

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,759
chore with a victim

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,360
and so for me as a technology debate is

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,600
the question of what role technology

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
plays in intimate partner balance you

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
know as we become increasingly relying

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
on technology in our lives it's

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,920
probably no surprise that uh technology

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
has become a lever of users can exploit

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,080
to exert control over their partners

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
and indeed earlier research you know has

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
documented a host of ways in which

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
technology gets exploited

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,640
uh i think these excellent papers raised

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,239
like like all good research raised a lot

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,280
more questions than they answered

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,720
so i had personally been long interested

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
in this topic not only because of you

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
know the human cost associated with ipv

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,760
but also because i wanted to understand

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
how our computer security tools

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
work in the presence of abuse by an

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
intimate partner who knows the victim

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
really well they have physical access to

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
them and their competing devices and is

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
highly motivated

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
so i was really fortunate and lucky that

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
uh when i joined cornell back in like

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
2015 professor nikki dell uh joined at

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
the same time and we realized we had a

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,840
mutual interest in the space and kind of

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
very complementary uh research

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
backgrounds

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,040
and so this led us to kicking off a

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,319
collaboration aimed at studying

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
technology and intimate partner violence

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
this snowballed over the past you know

93
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
almost six years now

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,959
and culminated in us launching a couple

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
years ago uh an organization called the

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
clinic tech abuse uh that we run at uh

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
cornell tech

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
and it combines direct you know survivor

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
interventions with basic research and

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
the gladwy c

101
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
uh and more and what i like to refer to

102
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,319
kind of as an advocate scientist type

103
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,400
model which is something i'll return to

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
at the end of the talk we have time

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
so what i was going to focus on most of

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
the talk is our research that kind of

107
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
started with

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
trying to understand the landscape of

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,959
technology abuse and intimate partner

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
violence via qualitative studies done in

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,599
the new york city area

112
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,959
and then uh

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
where we kind of started under trying to

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
understand the types of resources

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
available to users via online

116
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
measurement studies and investigation of

117
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,480
tools like spyware apps that

118
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
were talked about a lot by survivors and

119
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
support professionals

120
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,879
and then led us to our development of

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
like interventional models for providing

122
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,798
support to survivors

123
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
so we've been really fortunate to

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
be able to partner with the new york

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
city mayor's office to end domestic and

126
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
gender-based violence

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
this is the municipal government

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
organization that's tasked with

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
survivor support

130
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
and they in particular run a set of

131
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
family justice centers which are these

132
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
really nice one-stop

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
shops for survivors who are in this

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
context called clients

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,960
because of the clients and family just

136
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
centers where they can come and get

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
access to just a range of services all

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
in the same location

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
mental health support

140
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
police district attorneys you know

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
shelter

142
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
routing to shelters and all that type of

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
stuff

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
uh and you know being new york city the

145
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
scale is quite big i think in 2019 they

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
had about 64 000 client visits to a

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
family just center and you know this is

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,800
probably just the tip of the iceberg in

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
terms of the number of people in new

150
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
york city alone that uh really could

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,919
benefit from support

152
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,160
so i said we were able to do a study in

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
collaboration uh with the ngbv

154
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
and we designed a

155
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
protocol where we one did

156
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
semi-structural interviews with

157
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
50 professionals these are like case

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
managers social workers police officers

159
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
and others

160
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,440
and we're also able to do focus groups

161
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,680
with a large number of survivors

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
and at the time this was you know the

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
largest and it's actually still to state

164
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,479
the most largest and most

165
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,520
demographically diverse kind of

166
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,479
qualitative study in this space and

167
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
really allowed us to get a sense of the

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
landscape of what was going on in terms

169
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
of technology in ipv

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
it was really inspiring and continues to

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
be inspiring talking to survivors you

172
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
know they're very strong and many of

173
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
them were very excited to

174
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
share their stories with us uh in order

175
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
uh in the hopes that it was gonna help

176
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
us

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,479
understand how to improve uh you know

178
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
outcomes in the space

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
so with that in mind i'm going to read a

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
client story uh or a subset of a client

181
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
story to give you a feel for the types

182
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
of things we hear in the field

183
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,120
um we've taken precautions to preserve

184
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,639
anonymity of participants so the wording

185
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,319
has been changed a little bit but really

186
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
tried to ensure that these quotes

187
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,160
the quote still captures the voice of

188
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,039
our the participant

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
i was raised in a country in which women

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
are trained to serve men i'll say that

191
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
he never hit me basically but he did the

192
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
worst thing ever honestly i would

193
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
probably rather that he hit me instead

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
of the things that he did to me

195
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
he put spyware in our computer obviously

196
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
i didn't know because he studied

197
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,199
computer programming so he was very

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
savvy about it

199
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
he went into my computer he got my

200
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
facebook password email password and he

201
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,639
shared naked pictures of me

202
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
he sent them from his facebook to my

203
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,520
bosses

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,039
he took my phone and he sent them

205
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,319
through private messages to several

206
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,800
friends but also through my email and my

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,520
facebook because he had the password

208
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
the embarrassment that i went through

209
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,440
the public humiliation it beat me to the

210
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
ground

211
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
so stories are quite heavy uh

212
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,639
and

213
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,160
involve you know when we asked about

214
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,120
technology abuse we would often hear uh

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
of just a litany of ways in which uh

216
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,280
technology was being uh weaponized

217
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,919
really against uh the survivor

218
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,319
uh so here we see you installed you know

219
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,240
owner using shared ownership over device

220
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,520
to install spyware account compromise

221
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
non-consensual intimate images being

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
shared of the the survivor device

223
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
compromise impersonation but you know

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
using

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
an account

226
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,599
that the user had access to

227
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,280
and while not all uh stories were is

228
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
involved a lot of them were actually

229
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
there was very multi-modal in terms of

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,919
types of attacks uh technology attacks

231
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,720
that

232
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
we heard about

233
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
so we did a bit of taxonomizing to try

234
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,039
and understand the range of issues we

235
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
came up with kind of a at a high level

236
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,919
four categories of problems

237
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
one is what we refer to as ownership

238
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
based and this arises because an ipv

239
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
most often the user owns a device or

240
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
account maybe set up these devices and

241
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
configure them and this kind of

242
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,199
trivially gives them access to the

243
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
technology that the survivor is using

244
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
otherwise the

245
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
abuser may be able to compromise

246
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
accounts or devices

247
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,320
by either just knowing shared passwords

248
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
or being able to predict them or having

249
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
physical access to advice and unlocking

250
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,919
it

251
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
some other harms uh didn't involve

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
access to devices or accounts but were

253
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,360
more about like harassment online so

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
messages or posts um

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
on social media

256
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
threats of violence you know being

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
sharing pictures of guns or whatnot to

258
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
uh clients

259
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,959
and then finally like the

260
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
non-conventional imagery in that story

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,680
the uh

262
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
use of exposure of private information

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
as a threat or as a

264
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,880
punitive measure against the survivor

265
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
and so again we saw in that one story a

266
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,600
bunch of examples in fact this the the

267
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
client's account went on much longer and

268
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,519
there are many other issues that uh that

269
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,399
they had faced as well

270
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,000
so this raised a host of questions for

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,480
us one being you know why aren't our

272
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
security mechanisms working really well

273
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
for

274
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,040
survivors in these ipv contexts

275
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
in my view as a computer security

276
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
researcher is that you know many of

277
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
these ipv threats just are not really

278
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,839
being well addressed by our security

279
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,519
mechanisms and that's because of issues

280
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
with threat models

281
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
so one thing i'll say is we hear all the

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
time about how

283
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,959
abusers are hacking into accounts or

284
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
hacking into phones

285
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,399
and when i hear hacking of course i

286
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,519
think of you know what i've learned in

287
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
computer security classes undergrad

288
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
means like

289
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
software exploits sql injection or

290
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,399
privilege escalation vulnerabilities

291
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
like this recently with the news about

292
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
uh nation state level spyware uh

293
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
and exploit operations like pegasus but

294
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,519
this is definitely not what we're

295
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,240
hearing about and

296
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
seeing

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,959
from what survivors told us

298
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,120
um and instead you know the threats are

299
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
most often not very technically

300
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
sophisticated uh but they succeed

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
because there's this mismatch in threat

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
models versus threats right so as we

303
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,399
know threat models you know specify who

304
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,839
are the attacker victim and you know

305
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,200
what the attacker's capabilities and

306
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
goals are

307
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
and if we think of something as simple

308
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,920
as and well widely used as passwords

309
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
i'd say that the conventional kind of

310
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
threat model about this is that an

311
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
attacker is some stranger on the

312
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
internet you know who may be say pers

313
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,399
uh commercially motivated to compromise

314
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,680
and accounts but they don't know the

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
victim personally they connect from some

316
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
other place on the internet

317
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,560
but in ipv this is not what's going on

318
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,720
right the attacker is the you know

319
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
intimate partner or former intimate

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
partner who really knows this victim

321
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,640
very personally can guess or maybe even

322
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
compelled through threat you know

323
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
disclosure passwords

324
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
uh may be using the same devices or at

325
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,279
least being the same uh network as as

326
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,160
the

327
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,880
as the legitimate user

328
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,279
and so this makes it that the mechanism

329
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,920
just isn't uh working as well

330
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
and there's lots of other examples uh

331
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,519
you know we hear a lot about fake

332
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,880
accounts being set up by abusers and

333
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,519
you know to the support workers uh or

334
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,880
survivor that's very obviously the

335
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,120
abuser but you know the social media

336
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
companies would have no way to verify

337
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,519
this

338
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,040
or detection of abusive content i

339
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
mentioned like you know sending

340
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,920
threatening images say sharing throwing

341
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
images on social media like a picture of

342
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
a gun you know in the context of an

343
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
instrument violence situation this is

344
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,120
quite threatening but may

345
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
not violate policies or rules online

346
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
and i'll say that you know most of the

347
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,240
attacks that we heard about are what

348
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
fall into what we call this ui bound

349
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
adversarial model which just means that

350
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
you know the abuser is exploiting

351
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
standard user interfaces they're not

352
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,279
using any specialized tools even

353
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,480
and that's probably the majority of the

354
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
types of attacks that we saw

355
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
i think this is a useful model for

356
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,040
thinking about

357
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
how we can

358
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
structure interventions because the user

359
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
interface really is you know

360
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
the barrier the boundary which many

361
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,040
abusers are operating

362
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
okay so this initial qualitative study

363
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
really gave us a

364
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
broad sense of all the issues that uh

365
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
survivors were facing and this led us to

366
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,639
start under trying to think about how we

367
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
could structure uh improvements in this

368
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,360
space and so the first step for this was

369
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
trying to study how users

370
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
are

371
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
operating and the types of resources

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
that are available to them and that

373
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
support kind of them in their use

374
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,560
and

375
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,839
uh it turns out that there's just

376
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
actually a whole wealth of resources for

377
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,639
abusers online but actually much more in

378
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
terms of uh resources than for survivors

379
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
or potential victims

380
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
and so if you go google for something

381
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
like how to spy my husband i just did

382
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
this you know last night uh it actually

383
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,800
pops up a

384
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,680
google helpful uh uh helpful box which

385
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,399
kind of is taken from some article about

386
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,320
ways you can spy on you know covertly

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
spy on your

388
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
uh

389
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
husband

390
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,279
and

391
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,199
uh indeed this is just the iceberg you

392
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,959
know there's like online forums

393
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,120
discussing this there's uh youtube

394
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
videos mainstream media articles uh you

395
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,920
know advertisements for hack for hire

396
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,560
type services etc

397
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,880
you may ask why um i mean i guess

398
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
there's a lot of demand for these things

399
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,279
unfortunately and also many of these are

400
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
little cottage industries where people

401
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
are making money off of abuse

402
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,519
right the spyware or what's often called

403
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,279
stalkerware apps kind of ecosystem is a

404
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,120
bit of a cottage industry of

405
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,639
developers providing these um

406
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
apps to monitor people

407
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,399
and they make money off of it from

408
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
abusers and same with youtube and

409
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
otherwise

410
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,240
so

411
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,199
the

412
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,720
you know we wanted to dug deeper and we

413
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
also realized this presents a nice

414
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,920
opportunity for

415
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,360
online measurement studies to try and

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,959
get a better sense of what these

417
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,720
resources are like and i'll just talk

418
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
about you know kind of two efforts here

419
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,440
one is

420
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
on investigating online forums and the

421
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,199
other is investigating the spyware app

422
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,839
ecosystem

423
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,720
so uh it turns out that um there's a lot

424
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
of forums out there uh many of which

425
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
focus on infidelity

426
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,040
and like helping people kind of

427
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
navigate their perceived or real

428
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
infidelity issues in their relationships

429
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,199
um

430
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,639
and

431
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,440
this provides a ready public uh data set

432
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
uh well once we built a crawler to crawl

433
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,720
these uh forums and and download posts

434
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
um

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,279
it provides a pretty big data set uh

436
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
provided that gives us insight into some

437
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
of the things that people are discussing

438
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,639
online vis-a-vis intimate partner

439
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
abuse

440
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,160
so

441
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,519
we

442
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
after gathering this large data set we

443
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,959
did a mixture of a quantitative

444
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,399
qualitative analysis

445
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
to understand the content here

446
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,639
uh tech abuse discussions were pretty

447
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,800
prominent in the data set not all

448
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,000
threads and were related to technology

449
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,079
abuse but about 20 percent of them had

450
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,800
some discussion of of particularly like

451
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,320
intimate partner surveillance tactics

452
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,279
that involve technology

453
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,680
and this provides you know a source of

454
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
actual like threat intelligence

455
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
for

456
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,279
abuse tactics

457
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,720
and we saw this kind of complementary

458
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
viewpoint from what we were hearing from

459
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
survivors we saw from these posts um

460
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,639
online

461
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,320
you know the same types of

462
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
abuse tactics we heard about from

463
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,079
survivors

464
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
uh in addition you know uh we were

465
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,639
the richness of the stories that people

466
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
were sharing and it's really amazing how

467
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,399
much detail people go into it gave us

468
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
the ability to apply some deeper

469
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
analyses to try to characterize the

470
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,079
experience

471
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,240
and mindset of abusers

472
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
and so using a grounded theory

473
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
methodology we were able to use the data

474
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
set to drive a framework that we believe

475
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,000
models the progression of ipv tech abuse

476
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
for uh you know would be uh or future

477
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
abusers

478
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
and so our four stage model uh it

479
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,959
includes

480
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,480
uh starts with basically kind of the

481
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,199
background of expectation setting

482
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,880
um for the uh person you know and their

483
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
expectations about what is appropriate

484
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
in a relationship for example we saw a

485
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
lot of stories people

486
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,440
having

487
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
expressing the perception that you know

488
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,040
they should have access to their

489
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
partner's devices and be able to monitor

490
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
their accounts online that's just part

491
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,839
of what being a relationship is about

492
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,039
and then many of these stories then

493
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,880
change there's a change now to your

494
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,280
thinking where the person basically

495
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,839
becomes suspicious of the uh of their

496
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,880
partner

497
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,439
uh this also interestingly often

498
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
coincides with increasingly derogatory

499
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,319
language about the victim in the stories

500
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,039
and leads the person to brainstorm about

501
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,160
and seek out abuse strategies

502
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
um and then you know they may escalate

503
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,400
then to actually doing things like

504
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
partner surveillance or other forms of

505
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,559
abuse and this may then kind of iterate

506
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
in multiple cycles

507
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,080
interestingly many in many stories the

508
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
initial lack of evidence for say

509
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
infidelity was often taken as a sign

510
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
uh to the abuser that they should you

511
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
know redouble their efforts and look

512
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
harder because they're absolutely

513
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,919
convinced that they would find something

514
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,120
eventually uh the

515
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,440
stories also include a reflection often

516
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,799
about uh

517
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,960
that the abuser

518
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,840
um

519
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
you know reflects on what they did and

520
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,440
they often frame themselves as the

521
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
victim in these situations which is very

522
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
consistent with other kind of uh

523
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
discussions of

524
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,799
abuse

525
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
and this is just you know maybe in one

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
relationship but you can imagine uh that

527
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,919
makes sense that

528
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,000
people's experiences with abuse as

529
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
abusers also impacts future

530
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,760
relationships as well

531
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
so another interesting point in our

532
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,919
model is that you know there's clear

533
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
influences on progression from across

534
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
these stages

535
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
and these kind of uh

536
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,480
assert are like red flags that more that

537
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,559
the abuser is going to continue on

538
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,039
further in the model

539
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,600
and so these particularly provide us

540
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
with potential ideas for

541
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
interventions you know with would-be

542
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,200
abusers

543
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,480
and one thing that really stuck out to

544
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
me as a computer security person is that

545
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
you know often the

546
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
ability to get access to spy or other

547
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
tools

548
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,880
um or you know technical capacity to

549
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
surveil via

550
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
you know account compromise or this type

551
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,520
of thing was a clear uh

552
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
a clear hurdle that abusers often get

553
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,559
get across as they tried to escalate to

554
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
abuse

555
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
so this was consistent also with what we

556
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
heard from on the survivor side that

557
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
survivor is really concerned about

558
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,960
things like spyware

559
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,799
which also as i mentioned referred to as

560
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,919
dockerware

561
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,080
indeed we heard stories about how

562
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
abusers would stick apps on devices to

563
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
do location tracking or other monitoring

564
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,520
and as i mentioned there's a cottage

565
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
industry of these types of apps online

566
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,720
they

567
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,080
in the worst case particularly for

568
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,679
android they provide pretty invasive

569
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,640
capabilities in terms of monitoring

570
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
location also text messages you know

571
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,080
some data from other apps on the phone

572
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,639
et cetera

573
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
so we wanted to study this and actually

574
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
study this a few years ago we started

575
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,480
doing measurement studies to try and

576
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
understand you know the prevalence of

577
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
ipv relevant apps and like what the

578
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,799
scope of these tools are in terms of how

579
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,520
they

580
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,480
uh work for users

581
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,799
so it turns out you can use

582
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
search engine recommendations so if you

583
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,240
go like the play store at least if you

584
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
did back in 2017 uh because google

585
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
changed some of the stuff in response to

586
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
our study you can you know type in track

587
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,440
girlfriend and it'll provide a bunch of

588
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
suggestions for other searches people

589
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,000
use

590
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
and so we did that to gather a whole

591
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
bunch of uh potential searches found

592
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
lots and lots and lots of apps that hit

593
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
on those searches

594
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
use some lightweight machine learning to

595
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,520
kind of filter out uh clear false

596
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
positives and then did some manual

597
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
review to assess the uh what apps may be

598
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,320
usable for ipv

599
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,840
uh we did a much smaller study on the

600
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
itunes app store and also found

601
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
some apps

602
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
now these numbers are very large uh and

603
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,960
the reason is that

604
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
in addition to those kind of over

605
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
malicious uh spyware apps like the

606
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
pictures i showed in the last slide

607
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,720
there's a lot of what we refer to as uh

608
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
dual use apps that you know may have

609
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,799
legitimate purposes but again have

610
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,520
repurposed for spyware

611
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,400
and so

612
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
um if you go look at forums online

613
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,720
actually about spyware you all often see

614
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,919
things where people are requesting

615
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,280
information about

616
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,159
uh how to what type of apps to use

617
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
and you'll get recommendations in this

618
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,159
case for an app called cerberus for

619
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,440
example

620
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
at the time

621
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,559
of our study this was indeed an

622
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,320
anti-theft app that was available on the

623
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,600
google play store the official play

624
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,120
store

625
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
and had lots of features that are uh

626
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
useful to abusers uh

627
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,799
it was at the time able to be covert you

628
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,400
know you can record audio take pictures

629
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
remotely et cetera

630
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,679
and so this is what we refer to as a

631
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
dual use app you know it's designed for

632
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,320
say theft or anti-theft but

633
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,799
uh uh is repurposed easily and has the

634
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,240
features for spyware

635
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,400
so we've made some progress on

636
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,640
addressing uh ibv spyware i mean i

637
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,480
spyware is this

638
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,520
you know thing that i thought we

639
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
understood very well because it's kind

640
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,320
of like

641
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,919
malware other forms of malware and we

642
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,440
have tooling for that

643
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
uh google definitely took down a bunch

644
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,799
of apps and content changed how they did

645
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,559
search

646
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,200
for uh to try and not surface these

647
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,159
types of

648
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,960
uh abuse type searches and we've also

649
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
been doing some work with anti-virus

650
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
companies to try to uh

651
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,520
to get them to start flagging these

652
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
types of apps uh so that if a survivor

653
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,799
installs their nv product it'll at least

654
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,360
catch some of the more egregious

655
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
spyware

656
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,679
um and definitely a bunch of the uh the

657
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,600
the uh av vendors have started doing

658
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
this and there's now this coalition

659
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,760
against docker that was put together by

660
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
eff and some companies to

661
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,440
try to address this issue

662
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
there's lots of work to do um you know

663
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,880
we did some research that's actually

664
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,480
appearing this week

665
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,559
on how customer support

666
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,960
handles ipv situations at av companies

667
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
it's often a place that

668
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
survivors go to to try and get help

669
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
and there's lots more to do beyond that

670
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,679
most of these

671
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,080
in fact none of the apps the av apps

672
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,480
that we know that flag most dual user

673
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
have so this is still a kind of gap

674
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
between the uh what survivors kind of

675
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,559
need and what uh

676
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,440
uh

677
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,360
av is providing right now um so yeah

678
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
there's lots lots more work to do

679
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
um more broadly you know spyware is

680
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,520
something that's talked about a lot it's

681
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,000
very tangible it's very scary sounding

682
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
um and and is scary uh if it was

683
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,640
employed against you

684
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
but remember that most of the things

685
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,039
that we heard about don't involve even

686
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,559
access to tools

687
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,880
even like commodity commoditized tools

688
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
like uh ipv spyware

689
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,880
and moreover each individual situation

690
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
a survivor may be in is quite

691
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
complicated

692
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,919
and so

693
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,600
how we you know i think it would be

694
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
naive to think we can just

695
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,120
have a technologically

696
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,600
a technology-only solution to this type

697
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,919
to supporting survivors

698
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
and we won't be able to like fix all the

699
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,320
various technologies in ways that they

700
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
can't be abused right

701
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,840
and so what we need is um

702
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,760
socio-technical solutions uh in

703
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
particular this led us to starting to

704
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,200
think about how to design interventions

705
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
to directly support survivors who are

706
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,440
you know suffering from technology abuse

707
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,720
so

708
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,799
back to the new york city family just

709
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,200
centers which is the

710
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
new york city's

711
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
support centers for

712
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,559
ipv

713
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,559
survivors

714
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,039
what happens in these centers is that a

715
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,279
client the survivor you know may get

716
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
referred due to a domestic violence you

717
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
know police call or from the hospital or

718
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
they can just walk in

719
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,760
they get routed via a case manager uh to

720
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
various uh resources right if you come

721
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
in and you need help with uh

722
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
housing then you get sent to the housing

723
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,400
specialties or mental health or legal or

724
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
education etc

725
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
and this is a really fantastic model for

726
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
for getting

727
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,440
support

728
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,039
um in our initial studies when we did

729
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,200
these uh interviews with professionals

730
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,720
it became rev

731
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,080
uh

732
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
became obvious very quickly that there

733
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
was no best practices for evaluating

734
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
technology risks in this ecosystem

735
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,320
there's no screening for technology

736
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,760
abuse or checking phones is all very ad

737
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,880
hoc

738
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
and basically

739
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
support professionals would kind of

740
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,000
learn on the job you know as they

741
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
encounter an individual situation for

742
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
clients

743
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,039
how to try to help them navigate

744
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
technology issues

745
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
overwhelmingly both you know victims and

746
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,320
the professionals helping them report it

747
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
having insufficient kind of technology

748
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,159
knowledge for

749
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,520
for actually helping with technology

750
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
abuse

751
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
and it's not surprising we didn't meet

752
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,360
anyone with a you know formal technology

753
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
background

754
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,480
uh in the you know 50 professionals we

755
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,159
met there's lawyers or

756
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,400
uh social workers uh many other

757
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,320
professions but not a lot of people from

758
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,799
the technology sector and definitely one

759
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,159
of the things that we heard early on was

760
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:12,880
that

761
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,559
you know what we asked explicitly what

762
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,320
would be the number one thing you would

763
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,640
want us to try to do to improve the

764
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,000
situation and people said uh routinely

765
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,679
that you're getting more technologists

766
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,440
involved in this space would probably be

767
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
a big help

768
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,960
and so this led us to this idea that

769
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,320
really you know there's a missing node

770
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,640
in this ecosystem of support and we

771
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
should be providing

772
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,880
resources as well for technology issues

773
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
and computer security more broadly for

774
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
clients

775
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
and this led us this idea of what we

776
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,679
started calling clinical computer

777
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,799
security

778
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,799
you know the idea that we would uh come

779
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,120
up with models for training and

780
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
deploying you know technology

781
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
consultants uh who both understand

782
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
technology security and tech abuse but

783
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
also

784
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
have some background training on how to

785
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,279
interact with uh survivors

786
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,799
and uh

787
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,159
then they would be

788
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,000
there as a resource that clients could

789
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
get referred to to help them with their

790
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,360
technology issues

791
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,200
so in 2018 we spent

792
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
months and months and months you know

793
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
kind of carefully designing procedures

794
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,399
for how to deploy

795
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,720
a initial interventional model

796
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,840
um

797
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,000
involved you know i think

798
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,159
it was like nine focus groups maybe

799
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,440
maybe fourteen it was a lot of focus

800
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
groups that go back to the paper uh with

801
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
professionals kind of getting their

802
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,679
feedback on what we were planning on

803
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,480
doing and iterating on our designs

804
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,279
and then once we felt it was uh

805
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,480
pretty consistent with what

806
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,159
professionals were telling us

807
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,799
in terms of our models and

808
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,480
we went and got approval to do an

809
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,000
initial field study with clients

810
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
we had as part of our procedures we

811
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
would you know not just talk to the

812
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,440
client about their issues

813
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,640
uh

814
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
very broadly but also we built a

815
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,960
specialized spyware scanning tool

816
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
for uh that you can connect over usb to

817
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
devices to try and flag some of this

818
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
type of spyware that we'll be seeing

819
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,399
so we

820
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,279
deployed this in 2018 we did an initial

821
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
field study with 44 clients

822
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,399
scan you know 100 devices or sorry 75

823
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,760
devices

824
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
the instance rate of spyware was was

825
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
very low we only found a few that had

826
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,080
potential kind of spyware uh issues and

827
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
but we did find lots of

828
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,399
examples of like account compromise

829
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,320
in fact our takeaway is that actually

830
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,919
most of the time

831
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,840
uh of users get most of what they want

832
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,480
in terms of monitoring control by just

833
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,120
compromising client accounts like gmail

834
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
accounts or facebook accounts or icloud

835
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,799
accounts

836
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,320
we're also able to reassure many clients

837
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,918
about lack of of tech problems

838
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
so the

839
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,679
ngp leadership was really excited about

840
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,159
the initial results you know most not

841
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,600
not all survivors and survivors of

842
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,720
course were frustrated they had very

843
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,559
complicated situations but the majority

844
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,480
of survivors were quite

845
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
uh thankful uh and positive about their

846
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
experience with it

847
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
and so this led us to set up what we

848
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,919
call the what we started calling the

849
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,080
clinic to end tech abuse

850
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,960
which is

851
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,120
basically a direct service provider now

852
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,000
in the new york city area for uh clients

853
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,559
we work through the ngbv

854
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,159
we've served hundreds of clients you

855
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,279
know we have dozens of volunteers now um

856
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,440
pre-covered we met in person on site at

857
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
family just centers now we're doing

858
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,559
remote uh consultation so we go do

859
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,880
checks over the phone there's a paper we

860
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,559
had a paper at kai this year documenting

861
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,320
the kind of challenges of transitioning

862
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,919
this whole service to

863
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
um the realities of

864
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,640
of uh of having to do things remote

865
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,559
um we also do some trainings for ipv

866
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,000
support professionals there's also

867
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
something that's quite high demands like

868
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,679
training the support professionals about

869
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,159
technology issues hope with the hope

870
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,520
that they'll be able to help people

871
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,039
directly not have to refer them out to a

872
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,559
specialized computer security service

873
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,399
and uh there's been a lot of work on

874
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
legal advising particularly

875
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,320
from our former director sarah st

876
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,600
vincent who had a lot of background and

877
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
then thomas cadres at the university of

878
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
georgia um

879
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,880
really pushed on

880
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,799
advocacy on the legal front and we have

881
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,080
safe connections act which is being

882
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,600
discussed in the u.s senate right now

883
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
for

884
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
trying to push through some legislation

885
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,919
to get cell phone companies to make it

886
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,399
easier for survivors to uh

887
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,080
get out of uh shared accounts with their

888
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,559
abusers

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
so overall there's a lot i think to do

890
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,520
still in uh technology abuse and

891
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,039
confirmer violence you know we really do

892
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,679
need to rethink how we design technology

893
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,039
you know as i mentioned a lot about like

894
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
user interface i mentioned ui bound

895
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,640
adversaries but i didn't talk a lot

896
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,559
about ui design i think there's a lot of

897
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,919
interesting questions there about how we

898
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,640
can

899
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
improve

900
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,640
uh

901
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,640
or make harder uh the abusability of

902
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,000
features

903
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,159
and we need more thinking about that

904
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
we do need to you know reimagine and

905
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,519
think a lot about socio-technical

906
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,279
systems uh in terms of interventions

907
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,279
both survivors as well as with abusers

908
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,880
right like i think there's a lot of

909
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,799
opportunity to improve our understanding

910
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
of how to intervene with abusers to

911
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,679
prevent

912
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,200
problems from happening

913
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,039
in the first place

914
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
um and definitely there's policy legal

915
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,760
stuff that needs to happen

916
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,039
so

917
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,039
there's a lot of great

918
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,399
work to do and i think it's really

919
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
important that this you know is done

920
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,399
carefully we've tried very hard in our

921
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,640
work to kind of

922
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,399
run things by professionals who are

923
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,919
experts in this area also talk to

924
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,519
survivors who are experts on their

925
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,960
situation

926
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,000
and

927
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,840
to me it's been very exciting to try to

928
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,000
build this kind of mixed advocacy and

929
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
research model

930
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,880
embodied by the clinic 10 tech abuse

931
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,240
so that we can continue this type of

932
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
work in a way that's very well informed

933
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,120
by you know issues um

934
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,760
uh as they're faced by survivors and the

935
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,399
professionals helping them

936
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,559
and in more general i like to refer this

937
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,159
as kind of advocate scientist model

938
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,840
where

939
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,279
you know researchers aren't just

940
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,120
academics but

941
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,919
also advocates for a particular specific

942
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,840
population both in the kind of big

943
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,159
advocacy sense of like advocating at a

944
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,640
systematic systematic systemic level for

945
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,240
change but also

946
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
directly supporting individual

947
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
people

948
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
and i think this is a really beneficial

949
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,559
model it has been for ipv

950
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,559
because you know it really uh improves

951
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,399
understanding of the situation right

952
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,159
surfaces all sorts of subtleties in

953
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,399
terms of threat models

954
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,279
uh supercritically it mitigates a much

955
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,120
better risk of harm and exploitation you

956
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,559
know it's very

957
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,880
seductive to get into this idea of oh

958
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,240
we're going to solve things by throwing

959
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
technology at the problem and then when

960
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,760
you talk to professionals like no that's

961
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
not going to work very well

962
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,799
and that could actually be harmful for

963
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,559
for survivors so

964
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,600
there's uh you know being engaged and

965
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,360
deeply embedded in these communities uh

966
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,720
it's helpful for mitigating these types

967
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,840
of risks

968
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
and of course there's the

969
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
fact that you can have immediate impact

970
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
both on individual people's lives and

971
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,799
more broadly uh which can be really

972
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,640
gratifying

973
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,840
on the flip side you know doing this

974
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,679
type of work is really hard in various

975
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,039
ways right there's a lot of invisible

976
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,799
labor which may be to people who do uh

977
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,640
more human facing work than i did before

978
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,519
this this type of research uh was clear

979
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,840
in terms of partnerships also in this

980
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,200
topic there's a lot of emotional labor

981
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,360
involved for sure

982
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
i think more structurally as a research

983
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,760
community i don't know if we really have

984
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,919
great models in your security community

985
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,960
for like how to do these kind of blended

986
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,679
advocacy and science kind of approaches

987
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,480
um if you look at like the medical

988
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,399
field for example they have the medical

989
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,000
sciences training program which is like

990
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,919
you get a phd and an md and it's very

991
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,600
explicitly set up to be

992
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,960
supportive of translational research

993
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
um

994
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,960
and

995
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,600
you know also one thing we get a lot of

996
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
pushback on i'd say sometimes the

997
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,320
research community is like the pressure

998
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,159
to generalize like oh you know you're

999
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,919
studying ipv but maybe you should be

1000
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,679
looking at other stuff as well

1001
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,119
which to me is a bit fraught because uh

1002
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,960
you know i think you need to be very

1003
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
focused on particular user-specific

1004
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,719
populations in order to address their

1005
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
needs well and if you over-generalize

1006
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
sometimes things get some of the nuance

1007
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,760
gets lost

1008
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,639
uh in potentially dangerous ways

1009
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
sorry this is just you know i guess a

1010
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,000
question to the research community as

1011
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,839
well which is you know how can we

1012
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,480
i think this type of uh work is really

1013
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,719
important uh but it's very you know it's

1014
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,159
hard we were kind of lucky that we had

1015
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,839
the right ingredients at cornell tech to

1016
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,000
do it um

1017
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,320
and as a question the community how can

1018
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
we better support kind of development of

1019
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,960
these type of models i think it's gonna

1020
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
be really important in lots of different

1021
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,879
areas particularly as we

1022
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,440
kind of contend as computer security

1023
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,520
the security community contends with you

1024
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
know various forms of abuse online uh

1025
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,599
and are against you know particularly

1026
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,839
targeted marginalized or at-risk uh

1027
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,599
communities okay so with that i'll just

1028
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,320
uh wrap up saying you know we've done a

1029
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,040
lot of work in this space it's been

1030
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
quite a quite a journey uh for the last

1031
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,920
five years and been very rewarding and i

1032
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,119
hope uh

1033
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,720
you know you can go and see more

1034
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,119
information on our research webpage or

1035
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,800
on ceta

1036
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
webpage

1037
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
and i'm happy to take any questions

1038
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,560
thank you very much

1039
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
thank you very much tom that's

1040
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,359
a really insightful talk i think it's a

1041
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,359
complicated topic and one that we really

1042
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,079
need to be discussing more

1043
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,839
um so we've got some questions who

1044
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,160
started coming in here on the slack so

1045
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,119
i'll

1046
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,880
we'll go through as many as we as we can

1047
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,720
so one that i have here is my

1048
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,480
understanding is that the most dangerous

1049
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,160
moment for someone is when they leave

1050
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
their abuser

1051
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,640
and so i imagine this is also true

1052
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,599
um

1053
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,280
for the moment the user might realize

1054
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
that the victim has changed their

1055
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,240
passwords to take

1056
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
the accounts out of reach

1057
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,040
and so do you have any insight on how

1058
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
we might be able to

1059
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,880
help with that moment

1060
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,640
yeah i didn't i didn't have time to to

1061
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,400
touch on that so so thanks for asking

1062
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,560
the question whoever nameless question

1063
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
person is um i'll go look at this log

1064
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,280
later

1065
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,800
but uh yeah it's a really important

1066
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,480
point and this is one of the issues that

1067
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,440
we

1068
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
you know learn very early on talking to

1069
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,599
professionals is about this threat of

1070
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,960
escalation right

1071
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,800
uh and the reason

1072
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,920
it's such a big threat is it's well

1073
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
understood that you know because a lot

1074
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,599
of what's driving abusers is this they

1075
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,599
want to have the sense of control over

1076
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,440
over their victim

1077
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
and so you know when you're escaping or

1078
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,760
when you're otherwise trying to kind of

1079
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,920
uh get out from under that control that

1080
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,119
can trigger uh uh you know escalation of

1081
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,200
the abuse

1082
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
um and so this was critical like in our

1083
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
safety procedures for our interventional

1084
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
models this was like a paramount kind of

1085
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,599
concern

1086
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,880
um we take adopt from straight from the

1087
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,200
social work literature and practice you

1088
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,520
know doing client uh centered uh um

1089
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
uh designs which means that the client's

1090
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
kind of expert on their situation and

1091
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,280
you know we don't do things uh we were

1092
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
basically there to provide advice and

1093
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,079
information to them about the things

1094
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,240
they could do if they wanted and they

1095
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
felt it was safe to do so uh in terms of

1096
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,599
changing their passwords and these types

1097
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,640
of things

1098
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
so concretely like we actually spend a

1099
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
lot of time warning clients about these

1100
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
types of things right so when we say

1101
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,440
like oh you know you could you know it

1102
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,000
looks like your your ex has

1103
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,200
access to your account if you change

1104
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
that that'll be

1105
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,480
possibly visible to them and do you need

1106
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,640
to do some safety planning with your uh

1107
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
case manager about it

1108
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,640
so yeah it's a super critical concern

1109
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,880
i'm sure we could improve you more but

1110
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,200
uh it's definitely a friend of mine

1111
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,920
so we have another question here um

1112
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,599
can you say more about your findings of

1113
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,640
stock aware as a cottage industry and do

1114
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,040
you have a sense who's behind this and

1115
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,480
are there a number of small-time

1116
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,599
hobbyists

1117
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,200
or are there large-scale outfits that

1118
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
are responsible

1119
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,920
yeah great so i have a lot more to say

1120
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,119
on that and there's there's definitely

1121
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,079
details in the papers um i think there's

1122
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,359
a range there's some kind of hobbyist

1123
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,280
one-off developers who kind of slap

1124
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
together some poorly functioning code

1125
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,640
there's even just stuff that scan

1126
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
outright scans right and there's an app

1127
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
that doesn't actually work the way it's

1128
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,320
advertised on the play store

1129
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
uh and then all the way up to like you

1130
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,240
know companies like m spy or flexi spy

1131
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,839
which have been around for like a decade

1132
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,440
15 years or something in a pretty big

1133
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,480
operations with lots of customers

1134
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,400
um and and they make money right so i

1135
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,760
think they're making money off of it

1136
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,880
there was a big

1137
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,599
shift you know 10 years ago-ish the ftc

1138
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,119
did a

1139
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,480
basically you know went after one of

1140
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,640
these companies that was advertising for

1141
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,119
intimate partner abuse use cases and so

1142
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,800
the bigger players like flex finance but

1143
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
have changed uh their marketing to

1144
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,440
family safety like so you shouldn't use

1145
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,200
this for installing on your

1146
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,920
child's phone or in employee monitoring

1147
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,880
um

1148
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
we did some discussion you know so

1149
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,920
there's so it's a bit gray you know they

1150
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,079
still actually promote uh implicitly the

1151
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,400
this intimate partner violence uh but

1152
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,680
it's a little bit gone a little bit

1153
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
underground

1154
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,359
and we did some work in that 2018 paper

1155
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,800
at oakland um contacting some of the

1156
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,119
customer support for uh spyware abuse

1157
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,440
and asking about a few situations they

1158
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,760
it largely were gung-ho about using

1159
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,680
their tools for that that type of thing

1160
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
so i think there's a real opportunity to

1161
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
kind of

1162
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
try to take take

1163
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,680
you know deconstruct this the economics

1164
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,920
underpinning uh

1165
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,560
spyware abuse um and this but it's a big

1166
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,960
topic yeah

1167
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,720
it sounds like there's a lot a lot to

1168
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,520
unpack there yeah definitely happens

1169
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
offline

1170
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,200
um what advice do you have for students

1171
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,520
who might be struggling to walk the line

1172
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,400
between

1173
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
um advocacy and research given the

1174
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
challenge in the research community that

1175
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,960
you're just discussing

1176
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,160
yeah that's a

1177
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,079
it's a really great question um i mean

1178
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,920
it's attention right like

1179
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,359
just to make it concrete you know we

1180
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,520
have a number of phd students who are

1181
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
doing research in the space but also

1182
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,200
volunteer with ceta and it's something

1183
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,119
we talk about a lot of like

1184
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,319
you know you're kind of implicitly

1185
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,160
explicitly being pressured you know to

1186
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,400
do advocacy or

1187
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,680
um

1188
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
or research or vice versa yes you don't

1189
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,359
want to be exploitative of volunteers

1190
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,760
um and we try to build in kind of

1191
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
mechanisms to you know make sure it's

1192
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
clear that it's you know

1193
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,960
up to the the students in that case

1194
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,040
um more broadly there's always this

1195
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,400
question of like yeah if i'm spending

1196
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,599
time like

1197
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,119
texting back and forth with the clients

1198
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,119
about their about helping them change

1199
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,960
their password or like trying to get

1200
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,119
them not to be afraid of various warning

1201
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,400
messages that they think might be

1202
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,319
indicative of hacking

1203
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,839
you know that's time not spent on the

1204
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,720
next

1205
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
submission right

1206
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,160
um

1207
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
and i think you know that's where i

1208
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
think the community should be a little

1209
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,319
bit more making space for uh realizing

1210
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,640
this type of work takes a lot of a lot

1211
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,599
of time

1212
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,800
um

1213
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,480
i think some things at a systematic

1214
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,400
level i'll just say you know in the near

1215
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,240
term i think it's actually the work you

1216
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,400
end up doing is better right like i i'm

1217
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,160
constantly learning things from clients

1218
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,240
uh and it changes my thinking kind of

1219
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,079
fundamental ways about the research

1220
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,920
we're doing and and comes up with new

1221
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,560
research topic ideas so

1222
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,079
while it's you know a bit of a time of

1223
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,920
this i think it's it's well worth the

1224
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
investment uh if you can do it because

1225
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,440
the work becomes deeper i think

1226
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,319
some of the testing tools that kids are

1227
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,560
assigned to use for remote testing while

1228
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,440
doing school from homework

1229
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
could be dual use in the same way as

1230
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,640
stock aware

1231
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,200
and do these things get classified in

1232
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,920
the same way in the app stores and so

1233
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,079
how do you define the sort of draw the

1234
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,400
line between good and bad

1235
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,079
yeah you really

1236
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,680
can't uh

1237
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,880
good and bad it's very hard it's very

1238
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,560
great like you know

1239
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,599
the the

1240
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,280
statistics about like 3 000 apps that

1241
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
included all sorts of otherwise totally

1242
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
innocuous things like you know dropbox

1243
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,720
knockoffs or like

1244
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,319
sms forwarding

1245
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,319
tools or whatever and actually there was

1246
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,040
this whole you know thing this whole

1247
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,400
it was very frequent during research

1248
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,520
meetings while we were doing that

1249
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,680
project the phd students would come like

1250
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,359
oh you know here's this app it's doing

1251
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,960
like you know it's like a file sharing

1252
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,720
app and i'd be like this why are we

1253
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,319
talking about this in context of interim

1254
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,160
partner surveillance i don't understand

1255
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,760
and then the student would like point at

1256
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,599
a forum post somewhere saying oh here's

1257
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,880
how you set this up to like you know

1258
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,720
exfiltrate information from your uh

1259
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,200
so uh so too with these like any

1260
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,760
monitoring you know remote access tools

1261
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,079
like teamviewer uh definitely are like

1262
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,680
total legitimate tools it's like as far

1263
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,280
as i can tell the company is

1264
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,560
totally reasonable and you know they're

1265
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
trying to help with it support but you

1266
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,319
know people

1267
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,720
can use it uh for ill

1268
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,160
so i think we need to understand how to

1269
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,359
tailor response you know there's like

1270
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,800
the egregious stock where people who are

1271
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
just advertising directly to abusers uh

1272
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
there's tool and and they actually try

1273
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,440
to make things covert and stuff which i

1274
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,200
think there are some you know features

1275
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,280
that we can say oh that's a bad feature

1276
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,960
and you shouldn't include that and of

1277
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,720
course they're that intent

1278
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,040
and then there's the types of tooling

1279
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,400
that we just need to be aware of that in

1280
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
ipv situations like you need to be aware

1281
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,480
of these tooling

1282
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,280
and

1283
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,440
but uh hopefully

1284
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,720
companies have made it so that you know

1285
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,520
it's easy to spot this stuff and help

1286
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
help them uninstall it or if that's what

1287
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,119
they decide to do et cetera so yeah you

1288
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,560
need a range of

1289
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,160
of approaches

1290
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,079
and so this is just adding on to this

1291
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,920
but in your experience have most

1292
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,200
companies been sort of open to going oh

1293
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,720
we didn't realize this you know could be

1294
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,240
used in this way you know how do we fix

1295
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,119
it

1296
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,280
yeah so we do we spent well pre-covered

1297
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,240
spend a lot of time traveling to

1298
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,560
companies and like talking to them and

1299
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
yeah i think a lot yeah i think ipv

1300
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,400
threat malls just weren't on the radar

1301
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,960
in general right that you know um

1302
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,040
uh so i often would have you know

1303
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,319
android engineers or whatever kind of

1304
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,760
say oh i never thought about this you

1305
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,119
know thank you for sharing um

1306
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,640
and so i think in general when you once

1307
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,400
you surface this kind of what i refer to

1308
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,839
as like an invisible threat model right

1309
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:14,960
you know i think

1310
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,200
even in the scale of google they the

1311
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,560
security team's attention tends to

1312
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
revert to kind of the mean

1313
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,920
threat model right which is typically

1314
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,720
commercially motivated uh you know uh

1315
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
security set and so these things aren't

1316
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
greater once they are that's good now

1317
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,359
there are bad actors in the space just

1318
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,119
like anywhere else those criminals or

1319
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,480
what should be criminals if it's not

1320
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,079
criminalized

1321
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,720
who are basically you know uh

1322
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,760
making money off uh abuse and

1323
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
that we need kind of legal uh policy

1324
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,079
kind of stuff uh to deal with and treat

1325
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,760
them as the bad actors they are for the

1326
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,440
other companies i think it's informing

1327
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,040
and clarifying and then really the hard

1328
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,119
work i think on user interface design

1329
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,040
i'm not an hci person by training and so

1330
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
to me it's like

1331
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,000
it's there's a lot of fascinating

1332
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,200
problems like how do you you know can

1333
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,640
you build some of these features in ways

1334
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,560
that are promote the good use cases and

1335
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,160
add friction to the abuse cases it's a

1336
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,280
fascinating set of questions i think

1337
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,480
we'll need lots of research on

1338
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,720
um i've got a question here about could

1339
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
you comment on helping victims who later

1340
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,200
return to their abuser and who take

1341
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,760
multiple tries to leave for good

1342
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,800
um

1343
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
yeah i think that that's a very standard

1344
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
uh thing i think the

1345
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
the research that's like the average

1346
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,400
number of escape attempts is like nine

1347
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,880
or something or seven or nine it's a lot

1348
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,400
um

1349
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,760
and uh

1350
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
uh

1351
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,280
you know i think there there used to be

1352
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,960
this very paternalistic view i think in

1353
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,720
in the you know the support community

1354
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,160
that's like oh this is why is the victim

1355
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,560
doing this they keep like you know

1356
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
going back why are they being like that

1357
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,160
um and

1358
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,000
nowadays the view is to be much more

1359
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,280
client-centered or try to be more

1360
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,319
client-centered it's like look but you

1361
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,400
know people have complicated lives right

1362
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,839
and uh there's lots of reasons why they

1363
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,760
may decide to stay with their abuser or

1364
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,720
go back

1365
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,240
um

1366
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,000
uh whether it be because of financial

1367
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,319
support or immigration status or you

1368
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,560
know they you know they love the abuser

1369
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,160
and they keep thinking that the user is

1370
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,280
going to change

1371
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,960
et cetera

1372
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,319
so i think i think this type of stuff

1373
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,160
comes up in the technology sphere too

1374
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,000
and when we

1375
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
talk to clients like it's very

1376
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,480
complicated to figure out what's going

1377
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,920
on with their technological footprint

1378
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,119
right like just think about all the

1379
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,480
devices you have and then think about

1380
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,440
all those

1381
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,800
and like your children's devices if you

1382
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,720
have children with the abuser uh and all

1383
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,119
of your accounts like it's it's one of

1384
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,240
the big challenges actually is keeping

1385
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,400
straight like what accounts are there

1386
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,839
when did the abuser potentially have

1387
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,680
access to the devices or the accounts

1388
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,920
when did they not and so

1389
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,800
some of the key challenges there um

1390
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,440
yeah so so it definitely it comes up a

1391
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,480
bit in

1392
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,720
these cases most of the time when we're

1393
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,640
working with clients they

1394
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,000
we always work with clients who go to

1395
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,079
the fjc's many of them have already left

1396
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,359
the abuser

1397
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,400
it's pretty

1398
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,200
uh

1399
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,400
pretty mature

1400
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,160
far along because of where we're sitting

1401
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,599
in the support ecosystem um

1402
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,440
and uh so

1403
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,720
but some are still living with their

1404
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,440
views or yeah some may go back yeah

1405
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,720
i should say we've only just started

1406
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,240
doing kind of longitudinal support you

1407
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
know before it was always a one-off

1408
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,280
model where we would meet the client for

1409
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,560
like an hour and a half try to help them

1410
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,599
as best we could then they could

1411
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,119
schedule another meeting

1412
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,040
requesting their meeting later and now

1413
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,480
we're doing like longer term support

1414
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,839
where we kind of have the contact

1415
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,359
information for the client and actually

1416
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,760
you know talk to them many times so some

1417
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,440
of this stuff is still like we're still

1418
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,400
learning

1419
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,160
you know the longitudinal effects

1420
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,520
longitudinal issues that come up

1421
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,079
um so the next question here is

1422
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,000
um so i suspect that abusive tech is

1423
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,119
often a symptom of an uh underlying

1424
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,599
abusive social relationship and so if

1425
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
you mitigate the

1426
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,280
tech abuse

1427
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,800
um how does that affect the social

1428
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,079
relationships so are you potentially

1429
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,240
putting the victim at more risk for

1430
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
example

1431
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,359
i mean potentially yeah if you kind of

1432
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,359
have a heavy-handed intervention that

1433
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,319
could cause problems for a client um

1434
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,599
and as i mentioned before on the

1435
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,440
escalation front is something we

1436
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
consider

1437
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,280
and

1438
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,920
all the clients we work with have

1439
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,880
it's kind of critical that we're

1440
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,040
embedded in the fjc system because they

1441
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,640
have a case manager who can do safety

1442
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,000
planning with them and so a lot of the

1443
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,280
discussion will be like oh it looks like

1444
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,200
the account's compromised

1445
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,400
that's you know maybe we shouldn't

1446
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,359
change anything we should have you

1447
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,800
should talk to your case manager and

1448
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,240
provide some information

1449
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
you all can safety plan around it

1450
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,319
um so that that comes up a lot

1451
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,079
uh yeah i mean i think harm reduction in

1452
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,760
general here is very hard right people

1453
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,599
have very complicated situations and

1454
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,359
we're constantly thinking about how to

1455
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,040
uh

1456
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,240
sorry

1457
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,480
um

1458
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,559
how to uh try to reduce potential for

1459
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,200
harm as much as possible

1460
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,960
and another question here i know you

1461
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,160
said you try not to expand too much into

1462
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,240
other groups other populations but do

1463
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
you have any lesson learned lessons

1464
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,319
learned that you think would apply to

1465
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,319
other vulnerable groups

1466
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,520
yeah i think there's yeah i think

1467
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,480
there's like at the level of um

1468
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,640
methodological approach and then at the

1469
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,480
level of like

1470
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,920
actual insights in terms of like new

1471
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,280
nuance threat models i mean we

1472
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
constantly were talking about how this

1473
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,720
kind of persistent

1474
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
intimate attacker model there's prob

1475
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,680
there are a lot of nearby uh kind of

1476
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,319
settings right like i think uh

1477
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,640
trafficking uh victims uh

1478
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
it's often something that we talk about

1479
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,400
um

1480
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,319
you know the the models that i think

1481
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,359
have been on the radar the security

1482
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,720
community a bit like better settings

1483
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,160
like journalists being targeted by

1484
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,280
governments

1485
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,240
there's both similarities and

1486
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,000
differences right like one similarity in

1487
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,359
the sense these are average people who

1488
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,920
are getting abused technologically right

1489
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,599
uh and need help and probably having

1490
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
tailored kind of socio-technical

1491
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,079
solutions to helping them would be good

1492
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:44,880
and i know some people are thinking

1493
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,400
about those things

1494
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,760
it's also you have a precision adversary

1495
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,040
that kind of like has the resources to

1496
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,800
get to know that person but you know

1497
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,240
they also have if it's nation state

1498
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,839
level then much different kind of

1499
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,760
technical capabilities so some of our

1500
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,520
intervention models maybe wouldn't align

1501
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,640
well there

1502
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,160
so yeah i think there's a lot of

1503
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,839
of these i think online you know online

1504
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,000
abuse and just like harassment of people

1505
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,960
uh

1506
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,839
has similar feel sometimes um

1507
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,119
you know gamergate and these kind of

1508
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,280
cyberbullying or sexual harassment kind

1509
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,119
of online or gender harassment online um

1510
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,040
but i do think

1511
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,720
yeah you really do need to understand a

1512
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,640
bit about the a lot about the context of

1513
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,000
the particular population that you're

1514
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,520
working with

1515
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,319
to

1516
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,760
like i just i don't feel comfortable

1517
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,359
like diving into other areas unless

1518
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,800
we've spent some time talk to people who

1519
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,119
have been experts in that area and

1520
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,640
you know build up incrementally so we

1521
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,720
haven't had any energy to try to shift

1522
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,319
to another whole area and be like

1523
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,319
running a whole new research program

1524
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,480
yeah makes complete sense

1525
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,520
uh so this one is asking about financial

1526
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,800
abuse

1527
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,599
and

1528
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:45,930
um

1529
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,200
[Music]

1530
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,119
how much a company is doing to try to

1531
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,079
monitor or track that kind of stuff

1532
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,480
and stop um

1533
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,280
possible abuses on their platforms

1534
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,119
yeah that's a great question we haven't

1535
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,880
dug a ton into the financial so

1536
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,800
financial abuse is definitely one of the

1537
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,200
many levers that abusers exploit and we

1538
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,839
hear about it we it we touch on it

1539
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,280
during our consultation sometimes

1540
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,680
because people ask about their online

1541
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
accounts for online banking these kinds

1542
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,440
of things

1543
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
um i suspect like with social media and

1544
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,920
these other types of online abuse things

1545
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,200
it's hard right because the

1546
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,520
it's not clear to the bank who the owner

1547
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,440
of the account is potentially right uh i

1548
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,200
mean of course legally there's an owner

1549
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,400
of the account right but like who's

1550
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,760
actually using the interface that time

1551
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
if you have the right access credentials

1552
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,040
is unclear these are also often it's not

1553
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,640
you know like in the in the online

1554
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,319
harassment kind of thing like most of

1555
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,160
our mitigations are kind of

1556
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
anti-bot basically right look we try to

1557
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,680
distinguish between kind of automated

1558
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,280
scripting behavior because that's what

1559
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,880
commercially motivated attackers use to

1560
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,760
like send spam or uh do you know harass

1561
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,280
lots of people and that doesn't work

1562
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,640
very well for

1563
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,359
one off you know it's a person who is

1564
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,119
sitting down at a computer and like

1565
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,200
causing problems right and i think i

1566
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,800
would expect the similar problems in the

1567
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,200
financial sector but there's a lot of

1568
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,280
yeah we haven't done a deep dive on that

1569
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,480
at all it would be really interesting to

1570
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,280
see

1571
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,000
uh what you can do there

1572
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,839
um do you

1573
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,559
do you frequently learn of abusers who

1574
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,200
are just threatening or claiming that

1575
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,000
they're doing the spying um but nothing

1576
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
is actually happening

1577
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,960
yeah yeah definitely um

1578
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,319
i mean we don't

1579
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,599
we

1580
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,359
very i mean there's this gen

1581
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,960
you know most almost all the clients we

1582
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,240
see are are

1583
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,319
uh identify as women um and

1584
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,680
there's definitely this gendered thing

1585
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,000
that goes on too like you know oh most

1586
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,920
dudes are just by default considered

1587
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,280
better at

1588
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,119
technology right and that comes up a lot

1589
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,720
and then i think abusers also lean into

1590
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,480
that sometimes and say like oh yeah i'm

1591
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,880
going to control everything you know you

1592
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,800
because it's an effective and effective

1593
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,640
threat

1594
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,200
relately we often also we so we get a

1595
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,720
lot of clients who are like very

1596
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,079
concerned that their everything's

1597
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,720
compromised and um are actually quite uh

1598
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,200
hyper vigilant which is the the term

1599
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,480
from

1600
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,960
um uh psychiatry for like oh you're kind

1601
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,400
of very uh alert to potential threats

1602
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
right so every time they see some user

1603
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,319
interface uh thing that like is not

1604
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,520
quite working right they think oh this

1605
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,319
is a sign that the device is compromised

1606
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,920
and you know this is from my

1607
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,160
understanding this is a trauma response

1608
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,440
right hypervigilance is a trauma

1609
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,520
response and so people are hypervigilant

1610
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,880
because that you know

1611
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,440
it will document the way you uh

1612
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,359
uh repercussion of trauma

1613
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,839
um and so yeah trying to navigate that

1614
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,960
tension because one you don't want to

1615
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,200
disbelieve the client and say like oh

1616
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,559
that doesn't sound plausible or like

1617
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,559
whatever you know it's very easy to be

1618
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,319
very um

1619
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,079
to have bad knee jerk responses like oh

1620
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,520
that's that's a crazy idea right would

1621
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,599
be a horrible thing to say to a client

1622
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:52,480
uh

1623
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,920
but at the same time reassuring them

1624
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,000
that like it seems it's very unlikely

1625
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,079
that this is you know this slow you know

1626
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,880
it's not it's not a typical uh

1627
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,720
uh evident symptom of like malware or

1628
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,680
something you know whatever they're

1629
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,200
concerned about so

1630
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,880
yeah there's a lot of dynamics there i'd

1631
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,359
say in probably at least

1632
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,520
the cases i've been working on for last

1633
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
few months i'd say most often we don't

1634
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,559
find any evidence uh right of actual

1635
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,800
like oh that looks like a problem right

1636
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,960
partly it's doing remotes very limited

1637
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,640
in terms of what we can how we can

1638
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,400
investigate um

1639
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,520
but

1640
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,960
you know partly it's just like once

1641
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,240
they've reset their phone like any

1642
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,599
evidence of potential compromise has

1643
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,599
gone anyway so and that happens

1644
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,960
frequently so yeah a lot there

1645
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,119
um do you have any thoughts about the

1646
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,480
role of banning or de-platforming um as

1647
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,400
a way of basically stopping the spread

1648
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,720
of information about how to do this kind

1649
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,960
of spying on your partner

1650
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,720
yeah so you know google basically

1651
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,319
started regexing out

1652
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,240
some of these searches like track your

1653
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,720
girlfriend they tighten their play store

1654
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,960
policies they also took down some stuff

1655
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,119
from youtube

1656
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,280
um i think you know i think so i think

1657
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,520
it is an effective lever because it's

1658
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,040
definitely targeting some of the

1659
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,400
monetization

1660
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,160
uh effects

1661
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,000
um it'll be interesting to see how

1662
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,680
people adapt right whether they either

1663
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,359
go off platform like with other kind of

1664
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,960
deep platforming one of the issues is

1665
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,400
like oh they'll just go to other

1666
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,799
platforms that are less vigilant

1667
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,559
and then even before that like you know

1668
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,319
where is the boundary line right like

1669
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,720
life 360 is you know a company that does

1670
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,480
like child safety monitoring stuff it's

1671
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,559
very widely used right um

1672
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,799
and it also gets abused uh so should

1673
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,960
they you know where do you draw the line

1674
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,799
on these things is hard to say so i

1675
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,400
think d platforming is definitely

1676
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,480
critical and i think like tech companies

1677
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,760
can play a

1678
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,680
more active role like

1679
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,200
having paying people to think about this

1680
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,480
right in their in their companies like

1681
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,160
how to deal with this you know you know

1682
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,440
facebook like hired a head of women's

1683
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,880
safety recently

1684
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,319
um and then the people i've talked to

1685
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,160
and worked with at google are very uh

1686
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,160
keen on making improvements but

1687
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,680
yeah there's a lot of work to do there

1688
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,359
uh we've got a question here about

1689
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,160
considering the main many forms of labor

1690
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,319
the technical emotional as well as the

1691
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,960
resources do you think that the advocate

1692
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,400
science model

1693
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,599
is currently sustainable long term

1694
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,040
and what do you think would contribute

1695
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,200
to its sustainability

1696
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,440
yeah that's a great uh a great question

1697
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,760
um

1698
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,720
i think it'll be

1699
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,000
i mean i think they're sustainable in

1700
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,520
terms of like yeah you'll have kind of

1701
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,359
one-off groups that are

1702
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,280
fired up about doing this type of work

1703
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,400
uh

1704
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,280
but whether it becomes kind of um

1705
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,799
scalable in terms of like oh we'll have

1706
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,319
a you know community of people who kind

1707
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,079
of like do these types of

1708
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,720
uh direct advocacy plus you know work i

1709
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,480
mean i think we do have some

1710
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,559
one-offs in a variety of places already

1711
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,920
but it hasn't really been kind of

1712
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,760
formalized it's like oh here's a way of

1713
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,640
doing research in academia you you

1714
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,359
double as an advocate

1715
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,440
um i think you know like other things we

1716
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,960
need to make space for

1717
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,559
that if we want it to be kind of

1718
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,319
something that's a reasonable career

1719
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,440
path for

1720
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,640
uh

1721
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,000
the average i don't want to say average

1722
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,359
because everyone we're working with in

1723
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,119
these communities is like yeah a high

1724
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,880
performer right but like for the average

1725
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,119
researcher like how do we kind of make

1726
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,040
incentive structures align so that this

1727
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,160
type of work

1728
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,000
uh makes sense to put in that emotional

1729
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,839
another type of labor

1730
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,599
um so i think that's a that's a hard

1731
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,119
question i think we just need to reflect

1732
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,119
on it as a community i think you know

1733
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,040
having support from funding agencies you

1734
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,599
know having a recognition that like

1735
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,119
you know just being aware that this type

1736
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,160
of work can be done i think um and and

1737
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,599
recognizing it is good um

1738
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,799
yeah

1739
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,920
all right so we are one minute left in

1740
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,000
the session so maybe we'll wrap up here

1741
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,240
for the live portion uh but there's

1742
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,240
still lots of conversation happening on

1743
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,640
slack so if you've got some time

1744
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,000
uh to interact that would be fantastic

1745
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,359
this has been a really nice session um

1746
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,839
heavy topic but crucially important so

1747
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,079
thank you very much for bringing it um

1748
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,440
thank you for inviting me it was a

1749
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,640
pleasure lots of great questions i'll

1750
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,839
jump on slack

1751
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:06,799
thanks

1752
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,839
