00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,039
hi everyone thanks so much for coming to

2
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,119
our talk today about our paper titled

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
rabbi making visual task-based captures

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
transferable for people with visual

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
impairments i'm johan chang and i am a

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,039
master student at university of illinois

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,719
abandoned champagne

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
and here i also speak for my courses

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,760

slavic dance and yanwan

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
the motivation of our research mainly

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
comes from how captures are inaccessible

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
for people with visual impairments

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
especially for those task-based

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
visual captures like what i'm showing

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,680
here in the slides

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
they are like puzzle captures slider

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,399
captures and the most common one

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,800
google recaptures

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
although there are currently several

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,479
workarounds for people with visual

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,360
impairments like audio captures and

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
automated capture starving services

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
these workarounds are still inaccessible

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
in some ways for example audio captures

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,560
are much slower and require more

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
attention and memory capacity

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,119
as for automatic services they usually

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
either will only work for simple visual

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,640
captures

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,280
or poses severe security risks to

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,360
computer systems

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,040
so we begin to wonder if there is

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,439
another way to involve human assistance

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,280
and help people with vision impairments

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,560
solve these kinds of complex captures

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,159
what if people with vision payments

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,320
could just transfer these capture tasks

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
to an ally to solve

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and how might people usually impairments

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
want such a system configured

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,119
we are particularly interested in two

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,360
dimensions the source of help whether

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
it's franchising or processing and also

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
the compensation account whether it's

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,119
voluntary or paid help

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,439
to answer our research questions we

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,079
introduce the idea of assistive transfer

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,479
system and design the prototype system

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
called web ally as a design pro

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
the requesters can price some preset

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
keyboard shortcut when they meet google

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,560
recaptchas and

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
their designated ally will receive text

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
messages or emails with a link

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
of the same interface

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
it basically uses an interactive

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
screenshot to communicate limited remote

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,000
control between the blind and low vision

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
requesters and their slightly allies

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
then whatever the ally does on this

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,440
catch area will be reflected back to

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
this repressor screen until the capture

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
is solved or filled if failed they can

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
also use the same process to solve it

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
again

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
then we conducted a lab study to

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
evaluate our tool with 18 participants

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
in 10 sessions

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
we used a two times two condition

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
setting and asked participants to go

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
over the four conditions one by one

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
the conditions are friend sourcing

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,159
versus processing and voluntary help for

75
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,800
this compensation help

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,319
under condition orders are also

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,480
randomized using latin square method to

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
prevent learning effects

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
and to increase the status ecological

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,680
validity the requesters and sighted

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
allies

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,879
were separated in different zoom

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
breakout rooms and the requesters were

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
told to imagine sending the requests in

85
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
different conditions and the allies were

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
told to continue their daily work while

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
waiting for requests

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,440
we got some pretty interesting findings

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
out of the study for example

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
transferring these kinds of task-based

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,319
captures using screenshots still

92
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
requires interdependence

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
but participants all like having such a

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
system as a last resort alternative

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
using the interactive screenshots

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
rabbi could also mitigate the privacy

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,239
and security risks because the screen is

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,480
intelligently cropped and the remote

99
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
control is also limited

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,959
in the meantime allies still have some

101
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
concerns of receiving open links

102
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,560
which can be easily addressed with more

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
user registration and authentication

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,839
and also users still have some privacy

105
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
concerns about allies seeing their

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
screen but they are more okay with cross

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
crossing workers strangers seeing it

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
and given the time you can also find

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,160
other

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,080
insights later in our full paper

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,360
our prototype of this kind of assistive

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,919
transfer system and our study showed the

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
possibility of transferable captures for

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
future considerations on the interplay

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
between capture security and

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,639
accessibility is also required

117
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
as for the idea of assistive transfer

118
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
systems we consider it as complement to

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,759
the current system and workarounds it's

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,000
not a simple replacement to the existing

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,199
workflow

122
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,600
it also provides new opportunities for

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
social interactions

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
thank you so much for listening and feel
