00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,880
hi my name is prathi kashrik and today i

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
will be presenting our paper on solely

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
automated decision making sadm

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,680
sadm refers to solely automated decision

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
making where algorithmic decisions are

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,800
made without a human in the loop

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,360
it is widely applicable in job search

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
health care banking loan approval and

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
many other areas

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,040
however such automated decision making

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
could lead to discrimination social

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,800
segregation and loss of privacy

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,239
european union's privacy regulation gdpr

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
granted citizens some rights regarding

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
sadm which can be broadly categorized

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,160
into four parts one do not be subjected

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
to satm two to request human

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,039
intervention three to obtain an

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,360
explanation of the logic involved and

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,479
four to contest the decision and appeal

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,040
for the purpose of this paper we have

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,799
club these rights together under the

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,040
umbrella term sadm right

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
the motivation of our study is to

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,200
understand people's perspectives of the

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
sedm and the related rights

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
we believe it's important to gather

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,320
users perspectives because the audience

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
of these explanations are ordinary

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439
citizens

31
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
incorporating citizens prospectors can

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
make these explanations more usable

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,560
and inform companies and policy makers

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
to implement the sedm related rights

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
effectively

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
as a result we explored three main

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,320
research questions one what are people's

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,200
understandings of the sadm right two

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
what aspects of sadm do people want to

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,399
know

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
and three what challenges do they

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,880
anticipate in exercising the sedm right

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
for this presentation i will focus on

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,560
the first and the second research

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
question for rest of the results please

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,318
feel free to read our paper

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
as part of our study methodology we

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
conducted a large-scale online survey

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,560
with 392 parts friends aged 18 and above

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
we had 192 participants from the u.s and

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
200 participants from uk

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
our survey included 21 questions and a

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
short video tutorial on sadm right

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
we analyzed data from survey using mixed

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
methodology

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
our results included three main findings

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,920
one people's understandings of the right

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
two attributes of sadm decision to

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
explain and three challenges of

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
exercising the sadm right

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
i will now expand on the first two

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,720
findings in this presentation

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
for the first finding we asked our

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
participants about their understanding

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
of the sabm write before showing them a

66
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,640
video tutorial

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
participants shared some reasonable and

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
some interesting misunderstandings of

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,360
the right

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,640
three of the most interesting

71
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,519
misunderstandings included one deny

72
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
being subjected to sedm wherein people

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,959
believe

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
that the sadm right inherently allows

75
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,159
them to deny being profiled or subjected

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
to sdm processing

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
some respondents even anticipated that

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,599
the right provided them a choice to opt

79
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,280
out of sadn

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,760
lastly participants also believe that

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
the right allows them to choose between

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,840
the automated and the human decision

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
maker options

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,599
however these are the misunderstandings

85
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,519
of the right because the companies can

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,400
legally do sad and profiling and the

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
consumers agreed to the service contract

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
and human intervention is possible only

89
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
after a decision is made

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
our respondents also shared their

91
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,799
expectations of the attributes of sadm

92
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
decision that they desire to be included

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
in the explanation

94
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
the results covered 10 major themes some

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
of which are also suggested by the

96
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
policy makers in their guidelines

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
however participants shared three novel

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
attributes which were not previously

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
covered by the guidelines these included

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
personalized explanations that can

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
justify how decision is relevant to an

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
individual and provide actionable

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
suggestion specific to their context

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
second some participants were not

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
interested to receive any explanation

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
possibly because it's not worth their

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
time or effort

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
lastly participants were also interested

109
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
to know the unique factors that were

110
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,360
considered that is the criteria used in

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
the decision making and the weights of

112
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
those factors

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
we also provided design implications

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
based on our findings

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,479
some of which included one icon for sdm

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
processing which could help people

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
become aware of the background sadn

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
processing second sandboxing which could

119
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
allow people to experiment with the sedm

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
process and its outcome

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
lastly personalized explanation

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
templates that could offer multiple

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
level of details and personalization

124
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,919
that's the end of our presentation thank

125
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
you for listening i'm open to questions

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,759
now
