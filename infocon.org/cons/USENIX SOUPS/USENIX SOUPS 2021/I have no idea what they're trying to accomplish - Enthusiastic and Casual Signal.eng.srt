00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
hi everybody my name is dan bailey and

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
thanks for tuning in to our talk i have

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,760
no idea what they're trying to

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
accomplish enthusiastic and casual

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
signal users understanding of signal

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
pins

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
signal is an end-to-end encrypted

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
messaging tool that is privacy focused

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
minimizing data collection from its

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,520
users

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
offering not only secret messages but

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,640
also contacts and other metadata

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,559
when signal adds new features the goal

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
is to maintain this standard

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
signal traditionally relies heavily on

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
device local storage to reduce data

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
stored on signal servers

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,680
this introduces significant challenges

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
when transferring a signal account to a

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,039
new device

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
signal added a backup restore feature to

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
make this easier but that means storing

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
some data in their cloud obviously it

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,439
would be better to encrypt this data

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,720
somehow

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
additionally signal has relied on

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
sms-based authentication to verify

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
accounts but if they'd like to tighten

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,439
the security of this they can add

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,600
another authentication factor in order

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
to address these issues signal added the

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,680
signal pin

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
our research questions were as follows

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
are participants aware of how and why

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
in-app pins are used in signal

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
how effective are pin reminders in

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
assisting participants to remember pins

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
we won't be focusing on arcu2 very much

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,840
in today's talk so we can focus on

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
research question one and three

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
how do participants choose and compose a

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
pin for signal and does their

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
understanding of how these pins are used

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
affect that choice

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
pins add another layer of security to

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,840
your

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
signal account or so the prompt says

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,880
after some feedback from the community

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,960
the prompt expanded and added a few

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,920
sentences about what the pin is used for

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
this led naturally to our research

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
question are participants aware of how

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,720
and why pins are used in signal

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
under the covers the pin is used to

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
derive an encryption key for storing

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
encrypted backups to allow easier

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,680
transfer of accounts between devices

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
in addition the pin is also hashed as an

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
additional authentication value checked

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
during account registration for a given

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
phone number this prevents sim swapping

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
by adding an additional knowledge check

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
however an attacker with knowledge of

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
the pin can effectively both sim swap

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
and also decrypt contact information

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
metadata stored on signal servers

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
this larger context of signal pins can

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,239
be difficult for signal to effectively

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,560
describe and be understood by signals

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
users and this is what we explore in our

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,840
paper

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
we conducted a user study with 235 users

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,800
recruited from reddit signal community

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,879
forum prolific and snowballing the

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,319
survey reached many different signal

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
users with different backgrounds and

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
technical understandings

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
in order to gauge comprehension we asked

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
in your own words please explain how

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
pins are used by signal as this would

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
illustrate the effect of comprehension

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
on other security related behaviors

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,920
fifty six percent of the participants

84
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
were able to explain something about the

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,319
pin and we dubbed these enthusiasts

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
forty four percent were not and we

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
termed these casuals

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
enthusiasts tended to say something

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
about backup encryption contacts or

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
registration which as we've seen are

91
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
obviously all part of the signal pin

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,959
feature

93
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
by contrast casuals tended to say that

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,799
they just don't know what signal pin is

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
being used for with substantial numbers

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
of them thinking it had something to do

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,799
with unlocking the app or protecting

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
messages which it does not

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
to illustrate this disparity one of our

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
enthusiasts said it protects data like

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
settings and group membership and signal

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
contacts that will be stored on signal

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
servers using svr

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
nothing in the prompts that i just

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,640
showed you says anything at all about

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
signal servers or about svr that means

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
that this enthusiast was getting

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
additional information from supplemental

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
sources over and above what is in the

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
app in order to understand the signal

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,358
pin feature

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,440
by contrast our casual says i have no

113
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
idea what they're trying to accomplish

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
and explains why

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
from this we can see that for at least

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,120
some participants the in-app prompts are

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
not successful today in conveying the

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,919
right information

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,520
so our research question three how do

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,360
participants choose and compose a pin

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
for signal and does their understanding

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
of how these pins are used affect that

123
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,960
choice

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,639
so when you see the prompt on the screen

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,320
asking you to create your pin there are

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
two nudges to the user one is that the

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
pin must be at least four digits and

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
another is that the user can create an

129
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
alphanumeric pin

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
enthusiasts tend to pick long

131
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,160
alphanumeric passwords even though by

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
default the app is displaying the

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
numeric keypad

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,520
casuals on the other hand tend to just

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,320
pick a numeric pin using the keypad and

136
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
they don't tend to create alphanumeric

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
pins

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,919
so in conclusion we want to say that the

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
encryption and additional authentication

140
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
are only as good as the pin if we aim to

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
protect against snooping by signal we

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
need hard to guess pins

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
additionally if i can guess your pin and

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,240
do a sim swap i can recover your account

145
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
in order to extend these protections to

146
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
casuals we really need better

147
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
communication about the signal pin and

148
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
its purpose so we suggest calling it an

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
account recovery password because this

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,479
might encourage longer and better

151
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
passwords

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
in summary casuals tend to be confused

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
about the signal pin casuals really need

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
better communication and casuals need

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
more help in picking better pins my name

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
is dan bailey and thanks for coming to

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,680
