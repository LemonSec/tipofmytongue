00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,960
hello everyone i'm ayako

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,359
i want to give a quick overview of our

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
work

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,359
why they ignore english emails

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
the challenges of non-native speakers in

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,679
identifying facing emails

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,000
english is a dominant international

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,520
language

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
and 75 percent of english speakers are

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
non-native

11
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,160
however

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,079
in terms of user's phishing

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,480
susceptibility

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,200
also the phishing susceptibility of

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,520
native english speakers has been well

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,600
studied

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
that of non-native english speakers has

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,839
been little studied

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,760
so we asked two research questions

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,799
one

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
do non-native english speakers show

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
different behavioral tendencies towards

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
emails in their native language and

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,000
english

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,119
2

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
what are the non-native english speakers

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
concerns about identifying english

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,320
facing emails

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
we conducted an online survey

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
for research question 1

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
we conducted a role play task using

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,200
videoing participant design

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
how the participants were shown a set of

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,479
emails in their native language

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,119
and the other half was shown emails in

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
english

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,880
for research question 2

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
we asked an open-ended question to

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
investigate their concerns in

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
identifying english recent emails

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,880
we included participants from three

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
non-native english-speaking countries

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
with different levels of english

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
proficiency

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,799
java workers was a high-level group

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,679
south korean workers was a

47
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,720
moderate-level group

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,360
and japanese workers was a low-level

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
group

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
so what were our findings

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,080
for research question one

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
we found that non-native english

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
speakers are less likely to be faced

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
but more likely to miss opportunities in

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,120
english than the native language

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
they tend to ignore english english

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
towards both facing and genuine emails

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
these findings may be good news for

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
security researchers

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
but it's undesirable from the

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
perspective of communication

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,640
we also investigated when and who are

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
more likely to follow or ignore english

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
emails

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,480
when

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
they followed emails more

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,879
when the emails were from co-workers

68
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,519
younger participants with more

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,159
confidence in reading english followed

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,959
emails more

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,599
for research question 2

72
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,560
we identified five main concerns in

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,840
identifying english recent emails

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
first

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,280
participants have difficulty

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
understanding english email content

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
because they have english learning

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
skills

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
second

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
they have difficulty identifying errors

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
and unnatural language in english

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
if they can only understand the service

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
content of english emails

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
they cannot grasp any unnatural language

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
nuances

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,040
sad

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,599
they are familiar with english facing

88
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,959
emails

89
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,040
they have no chance to see english

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,840
recent emails in their country's media

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,360
fourth they are less attentive to

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
english emails

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
they panic when they receive english

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
emails

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
fifth

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
they have difficulty finding similar

97
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,599
cases in english on the internet

98
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,238
they have difficulty searching for and

99
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,199
interpreting information in english

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
and ascertaining the reliability of

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
information sources in english

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
on the basis of our findings we

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
discussed four design implications to

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
help non-native speakers combat facing

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
attacks

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
the language agnostic fishing knowledge

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,120
base

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,199
anti-fishing training

109
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
machine translation

110
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,199
and an old follow-up mechanism

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,479
