1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,119
hi i'm sophie from uchicago i'll be

2
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,199
talking about our pursuit of usable and

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
useful data downloads

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,840
the right of access is a key privacy

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,760
principle requiring that organizations

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,439
provide a data subject a copy of the

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,760
data it holds about them upon request

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,360
in recent years the general data

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,520
protection regulation gdpr and the

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
california consumer privacy act ccpa

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040
have strengthened the right of access

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
when users invoke their right of access

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,320
companies typically provide a

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
downloadable archive which we call data

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
downloads

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
data downloads come in many different

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
formats json csv html and more here's a

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
small excerpt from my spotify data which

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,160
was a folder containing 11 json files

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
these downloads can be massive sometimes

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
many gigabytes large with nested folders

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,920
and files both the magnitude of data

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,439
downloads and the variants in how

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,200
different companies format their files

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
raise questions about whether current

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
data downloads provide useful

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
transparency

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,720
thus we identified three research

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
questions

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
first how do users react to both the

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,960
format and content of current data

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,119
downloads second what information do

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,799
users consider important to include in

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,880
data downloads and what uses do they

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
imagine for this information

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
third how could data downloads be

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,880
redesigned to better support users goals

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400
we answered these questions through a

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
user study

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,439
we recruited prospective participants on

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
prolific and had them request their own

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
data from one of six popular websites

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
when they received their data we invited

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
them to a 75-minute online focus group

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
with three to four other participants

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
overall we conducted 12 focus groups

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,119
with a total of 42 users

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
we selected six companies that had fast

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
and easy data request processes each

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
participant downloaded their own data

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
from one of these companies

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
during focus groups we led participants

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,318
through a series of activities that

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,000
helped them explore their data and

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
co-design ideas for the future of data

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
access

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
each session focused on one company

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
we first explained the laws that enabled

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
users to download their data in the

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
first place we then gave them several

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
minutes to freely explore their files

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
while thinking aloud letting us capture

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
their real-time reactions to their own

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
data

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
we then led a structured scavenger hunt

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,519
to ensure that participants were

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
familiar with their data downloads

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,480
we then led a group discussion in which

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,920
users talked about the format and

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,640
content of their data downloads

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
to inspire users to think about other

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
ways of viewing their data we briefly

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
summarized data visualization techniques

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
and had them explore visualizations on

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
the informationist beautiful website

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
finally we asked users to sketch the

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
ideal version of a data visualization

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
tool for data downloads we wanted to

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
learn how they would prefer to see their

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
data as well as which ideas discussed

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
during the session made it into these

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
designs

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,599
to analyze the data we transcribed the

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,040
sessions and performed affinity

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
diagramming

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
we also analyzed user's sketches we

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
coded for the themes that emerged in

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,238
affinity diagramming

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
in our paper we present design

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
recommendations based on what

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
participants observed and suggested i'll

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
quickly highlight some key findings

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,840
users described navigating data

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,319
downloads as time consuming overwhelming

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,440
and hard

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
one participants said it's like they

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,959
didn't even try they just kind of dumped

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,000
it on you

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
another stated most of the interesting

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
data is stored in these files that as a

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
non-specialist i can't read we're

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
effectively illiterate when it comes to

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
reading this additional data they've

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
been collected

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
participants suggested many organization

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
and filtration options to improve the

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
process of navigating their files

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
users also hope to see more data about

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,239
inferences and recommendation algorithms

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,080
which some companies omit

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
a participant from a facebook group said

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
what's interesting to me is how my

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,159
online behavior is affecting how this

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
company and all the affiliates see me

115
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,238
and in what categories say they put me

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
or don't put me that has a way broader

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,238
implication who is programming these

118
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
algorithms do they represent a broader

119
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
part of society or are they all from a

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
very similar group

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
participants also wanted future data

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
downloads to be more interactive and fun

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
to explore

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,759
some requested an inband deletion

125
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
feature which would leverage their legal

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,720
right of erasure

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
we also make policy recommendations

128
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
data downloads are often machine

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
readable so that they satisfy data

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
portability rights however this can make

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
files hard for humans to understand

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
data access laws should include

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
readability standards

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
the law should clarify what data is

135
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
required to appear in a data download

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
potentially including inferences and

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,479
derived data

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,240
further several participants felt that

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
their files were incomplete companies

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,479
should specify when and why data is

141
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
missing

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
we hope our initial study spurs future

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
research making data downloads more

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,039
useful and usable thanks for listening
