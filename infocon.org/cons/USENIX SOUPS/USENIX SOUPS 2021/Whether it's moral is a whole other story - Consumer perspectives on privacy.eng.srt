hi i'm liaison kennedy i'm an assistant

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,240
professor from the university of

waterloo stratfor school of interaction

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,720
design and business this research is

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,960
done in collaboration with sonia chozon

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,279
from carleton university

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,000
in this paper we explore general privacy

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
perceptions and self-reported knowledge

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
of businesses data collection and usage

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
practices towards consumer data in

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,600
canada

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
we like to share the moral code we

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
identify that consumers rely on to

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,960
assess privacy violations based on four

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
core moral values

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,039
so for for those of you who might not be

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
familiar with the canadian legal

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,680
landscape our privacy law is known as

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,600
the personal information protection and

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
electronic documents act also known as

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,760
pipita

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
our participants describe their

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,200
understanding of their own privacy

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
rights and their interpretations of 10

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
privacy scenarios describing corporate

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
data privacy practices

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,119
that we adopted from real privacy cases

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
published online by the office of the

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
privacy commissioner of canada

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
this data is collected through a survey

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
with 300 canadian residents and

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
follow-up interviews with 32

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
participants using grounded theory

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
analysis

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
so i want you to picture this scenario

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
your cellular provider notifies you by

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
mail that the company intends to use

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
customers personal information for

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
secondary marketing purposes

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
now you could have your name removed for

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
the marketing list by contacting the

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
company otherwise it will assume your

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
consent

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
we could argue that company in the

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
scenario has implied consent complying

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,040
with pivotal

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,399
because they are using existing

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,200
customers information and by signing up

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
for the service customers give implied

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,640
consent to receive marketing material

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,160
however when we asked whether the

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,000
company acted appropriately under the

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,640
law our participant deemed this approach

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
to be within the boundary of the law but

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
highly unethical

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
for example one of our participants said

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
do i think that they acted appropriately

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,280
under the law i'm hard pressed to say

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
that's illegal i mean i could be wrong

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
on that one but i don't think that they

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,760
being particularly ethical

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
i don't like the optics of it but are

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,239
they being unlawful to my knowledge i

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
don't think it's unlawful

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
these responsive sets a stage for a

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
grounded theory where we propose that

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
participants understand em perspective

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
follows a moral code for data privacy

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
we base our model on the identified

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,959
codes and sub-codes and the

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,480
relationships between concepts

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
identified in the analysis

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
we refine the results into four core

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
moral values that consumers use to

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,440
navigate their information disclosure

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
these include trustworthy organization

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,319
transparency of the organization

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
feeling of control over personal

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
information and access to privacy

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
information

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
our participants moral codes suggest new

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
insights and expectations of privacy in

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
canada

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
based on these expectations we suggested

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
an improved consent model more control

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
and access and the developmental privacy

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
ethics assessment tools for helping

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
organizations align their privacy

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,879
practices and policies with consumers

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
moral expectations

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
however a key problem lies with how to

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,879
convince corporate organizations to take

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,000
these steps

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,920
our view is that this issue requires

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,159
increased governmental regulation and

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,720
oversight but studies such as this one

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
help to increase awareness among

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,720
stakeholders and provide

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,879
supporting evidence to those in position

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,599
to pose for change

101
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
in conclusion we suggest that

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
understanding users privacy ethics could

103
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
offer rich insights into how they engage

104
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
in online privacy decision making

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
if you're interested in learning more

106
