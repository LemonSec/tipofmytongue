1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,320
hi everyone my name is bucky and today i

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,640
will be talking about a research that i

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,160
did with you

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,560
and costa at the university of british

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,960
columbia and it's about the challenges

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,720
and threats with mass telecommuting

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,559
why study challenges and telecommuting

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,640
since the pandemic there has been an

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
increase in cyber attack

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,399
research shows that

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,559
cyber attack has been on the rise and

12
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,559
these cyber attacks involve various

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,360
attack techniques that range from email

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
phishing emails social engineering

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
attacks third party compromise brute

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,840
force and many other attack

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
techniques stanford research also shows

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
that as of june 2020

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,600
57

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,400
of the workforce now work from home

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
and this is expected to rise

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
many organizations are now moving to a

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
hybrid work from home situation and many

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
are also moving to a permanent walk from

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,759
home situation

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,520
so if there has been an increase in

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,040
cyber attacks as a result of

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
telecommuting and telecommuting is

29
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,159
expected to continue long term there is

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
a need for us as scientists to try to

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
understand what exactly are the

32
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,720
challenges in telecommuting and how can

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
we mitigate for these challenges

34
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,799
to this end

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
our research question is

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
what are employees security and privacy

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,799
challenges

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,040
threat and perceived risk while working

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
from home

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
to answer this research question we

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
conducted semi-structured interviews

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,119
with 14 male and 10 female and age range

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,840
from 19 to 64 years old

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
we're going to give an overview of our

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
findings we discovered four major

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,280
challenges that participants experience

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
while working from home

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,878
the first one is technological

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,200
challenges and this has to do with the

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
use of technology with telecommuting and

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
this could lead to a compromise to

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
participant security and personnel

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
privacy

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
for example a participant was afraid to

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,720
pick up um scam calls because he was

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
making use of his personal phone in

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,879
order to telecommute

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,120
we also have human challenges and this

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
refers to the varying limitation or

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
capabilities of humans for example some

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
um people that were working from home

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,040
were not tech savvy and so they did not

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
know how to work from home effectively

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,599
for example the participant talked about

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
how she believes that vpn is unhackable

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
and for her that was just her knowledge

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,440
of vpn and i thought she was using it in

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
such a way that she believed that nobody

69
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,360
can be able to hack into whatever it is

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
that she was doing when using vpn

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
another finding is organizational

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
challenges and this has to do with the

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
fact that telecommuting violates work

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
policies and so organizations did not

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
even have any work from home guidelines

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,120
for people to work from home with

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,879
for example a participant that had to

78
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
handle financial matters had to use his

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
own discretion on determining how

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,360
exactly to do this without leading to a

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
compromise of the organization's

82
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
confidential information or to the

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
customer's confidential information

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,440
also we have environmental challenges

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
and this has to do with the fact that a

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,879
lot of people are watching from their

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
personal space and this comes with his

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
own set of challenges

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,159
for example a participant was afraid of

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,280
people breaking into um his house in

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
order to take the expensive

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
organization's resources that he was

93
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,480
using to telecommute

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
and this for him was a massive fear and

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,959
made him nervous just the thought that

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,519
people can come in to take all of the

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
resources being used to work from home

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
the key takeaway of our research is

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
there is a dilemma of maintaining

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
privacy security and safety while

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,360
working from home

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
employees want to maintain their privacy

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,918
their security and their safety as well

104
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,440
as the safety of the people that are

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
living with them in the house where they

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
tell you commute

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
employers on the other hand want the

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
organization's work done and sometimes

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,639
this comes at the cost of employees

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
security privacy and safety

111
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,199
even as telecommuting becomes more

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
long-term there is a need to find a

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
balance between these two so that

114
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
employees can work safely from home and

115
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,600
employers as well can protect their

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,759
confidential information thank you for

117
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,759
listening
