00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,080
hi my name is anastasia daniloba from

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,920
the university of bonn

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,080
me and my colleagues conducted a study

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
with freelance developers on password

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,279
storage to provide new insights into the

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,599
task design of developer security

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,520
studies

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
when investigating the security behavior

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,480
of software developers researchers often

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,440
ask their participants to write

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,559
code so to complete a programming task

12
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,680
however programming tasks require a

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,640
large amount of participants time and

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
this results in high costs

15
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,760
and small sample sizes

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
therefore we tested a new methodology

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,239
for security developer studies we

18
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,800
investigated how participants review

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,360
code snippets in an online study instead

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,320
of writing code

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
after that we compared our results

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
with a study on password storage where

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,580
developers needed to program

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,720
[Music]

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,799
the task on their own

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
in our study we asked freelance

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
developers to write

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
code reviews for password storage code

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
snippets we wanted to find out how

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
freelancers behave in an online studies

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
if they are asked to review code instead

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
of writing it

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
and prior work showed that developers

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,479
often tend to focus on functionality

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,680
first and security later similar to end

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
users by the way

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,759
therefore we prompted half of our

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
participants for security

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
that means that the prompted group was

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,479
specifically asked in the task

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
description to make sure that the

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,839
password is start securely

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,360
we recruited a total of 44 participants

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
from fiverr.com which is a freelance

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,360
platform

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,479
and each participants got one of three

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
java code snippets

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
each snippet contained password storage

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,120
methods which were not secure

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
and the methods were

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,480
plain text base 64 encoding and md5 all

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
insecure methods

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
so with the prompting and the code

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
snippets we had a total of six

55
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,360
conditions in our study

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
let's quickly discuss some of our main

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
results

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
the majority of our participants

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
reported to have reviewed the code

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
snippet manually

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,120
also our participants needed a median of

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
83 minutes to complete the whole survey

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959
and our participants stated when they

64
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,560
looked for

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,480
functionality

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
logic

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
maintainability

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,599
performance

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,159
and error handling issues when we

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,760
reviewed our code snippet

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,200
so regarding the password storage issue

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
13 of 44

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,159
found the password storage issue and

74
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,200
commented it in their code review

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
only two of these 13 were prompted

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,760
and even though our sample was small

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,080
prompting for security had a significant

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
effect on mentioning the password

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,238
storage issue in the code review

80
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
our password related issues were

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,680
password validation

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
password encryption

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
sql and jar injection

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
or the complexity of password storage

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
finally our findings suggest

86
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
that code reviewing studies could be an

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
interesting approach for conducting

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
security developer styles

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
for the future work we recommend testing

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,040
a hybrid between code reviewing and a

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
code writing developer studies for

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,159
example a participant could receive

93
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
functional insecure code and be asked to

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
write the review

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
and if necessary to correct the issues

96
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,639
within the code this could combine the

97
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
advantages of both methodologies writing

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,440
and code review

99
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
however it might also increase the time

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
of solving the study tasks for the

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
participants again

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
so

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
although the freelancers in our study

104
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
indicated that they feel responsible for

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
security our results showed that they

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
did not focus on security now in their

107
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
code reviews if they are not prompted

108
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,520
and even

109
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
in a security critical task such as

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
password storage not all the freelancers

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,320
were aware of security

112
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
