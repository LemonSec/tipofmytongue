00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,480
welcome everyone and thanks for joining

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
us my name is shorty and i recently

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,160
graduated from the university of

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,199
maryland with a bachelor's degree

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
and i'm desiree and i also recently

6
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
graduated from the university of

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
maryland also with a bachelor's degree

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,719
and we're both from the sbtu lab at umd

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,239
and today we'll be discussing our

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,160
research which compares security and

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
privacy attitudes among users of

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
different mobile and smart speaker

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,719
platforms in the united states

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
our original research motivation stems

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
from past mobile security research

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
largely being limited to the analysis of

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,199
only one platform at a time

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,199
so as we can see in this graphic the

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
different technology platforms might

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
experience differences in their user

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
groups if they largely differ in privacy

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,959
sensitivity especially given that some

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
platforms like apple for instance has

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
tried to sell themselves on privacy so

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
therefore studying only one platform at

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,680
a time could introduce biases or

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,360
misimportant findings

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,680
so if these differences may exist we

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,960
want to understand them better and

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
provide important context about the

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,880
generalizability of research results

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,119
so this leads us to our main research

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,960
question which is are there meaningful

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
differences and privacy and security

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
preferences beliefs and attitudes

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,159
between users of different platforms

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,560
and so to answer this we administered a

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
privacy and security perception survey

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,360
to a quasi-representative sample of the

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,759
us population through qualtrics we

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,479
crowdsourced 493 participants through

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
prolific to obtain the sample population

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,840
representative of gender age and race

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
our survey analyzed differences in

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,520
perceptions between ios versus android

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
smartphone users and between google home

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
and amazon echo smart speaker users and

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
to construct the questions we borrowed

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,959
from two pre-existing validating metrics

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,280
for security and privacy perceptions and

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
the first was the security attitudes or

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,160
sa-6 metric and the second was the iuipc

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
metrics

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
we also pulled questions from national

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
surveys from the pew research center

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
that looked at skepticism toward company

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
data practices and overall digital

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
knowledge

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
so now getting to our main results we

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
have these three graphs here which

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
correlate to three of the metrics that

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,760
we discussed earlier which were the sa-6

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,400
security attitudes pew skepticism and

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
the iuipc or the privacy concern

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
comparison

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,120
and so really what we want to pay

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
attention to here is the general shape

68
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,599
across the left side which is the ios

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,120
users for each of these graphs and the

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
right side which is the android users

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,080
and since the shape between the ios and

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
android sides are relatively similar we

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
therefore found no differences across

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
the security attitudes skepticism

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
towards company data practices

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,958
and the overall privacy concerns

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
however we were able to find a

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
significant difference between ios and

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,879
android users and pew knowledge

80
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
comparison and the pew knowledge

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,200
comparison metric so the y-axis shows

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
the range of possible values for each

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
scale while the x-axis shows the

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,640
fraction of total participants with each

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
score

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
as you can see

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
and the highlighted squares at the top

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
more android users tended to have more

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,799
digital privacy and security knowledge

90
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
than the ios users

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
meanwhile at in the highlight of squares

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,239
at the bottom of the screen

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,400
more ios users tended to have less

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
digital privacy and security knowledge

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
than the android users

96
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,400
so overall we found no significant

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
differences in the attitudes of these

98
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,280
user groups towards security and privacy

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
concerns or skepticism towards company

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,040
data practices however we did find

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,720
android users were somewhat more

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
knowledgeable about digital security and

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,680
privacy and finally we found no

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
significant differences in any of our

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
metrics across the user groups for smart

106
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
speakers so this suggests that

107
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,238
cross-platform differences are not

108
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
critical for security and privacy

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,160
research on smart speakers but this

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,759
still remains an open question whether

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,080
this might extend to other iot devices

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
finally here are a few recommendations

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,960
based on key takeaways from the study

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
when looking at future studies that look

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,720
at users of technology platforms

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
deploying a study on only one platform

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
might be okay for addressing a range of

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,639
security or privacy concerns

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,479
but if your study will be affected by

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
technical knowledge you might need to

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
consider recruiting cross-platform

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,919
representation or otherwise control for

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
it because as we found with android

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
users they tended to have more digital

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
privacy and security knowledge than the

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
ios users

127
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,039
thank you so much for listening and feel

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,400
free to reach out to us with any

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,919

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,919
slide

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
you
