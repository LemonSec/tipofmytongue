00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
hello i am anway sturladhar from the

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
university of south florida i am

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,080
delighted to present our research

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
exploring the role of situated learning

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
and starting a security culture in a

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
software company

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,439
our research team includes two computer

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,760
science professors chiang mingoo and jay

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
likati and a professor of anthropology

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,840
daniel london

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
we started this research with the goal

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
of obtaining first-hand understanding of

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
software development and security in the

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,559
real world

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
software development in most cases is a

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
collective effort of multiple software

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
engineers working together towards the

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,320
same goal

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,680
in social science there's a

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,760
well-established research methodology to

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
study the dynamics of a group of people

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,160
and attain a comprehensive understanding

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,359
of their culture participant observation

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,280
we adopt this methodology for our

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,319
research

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,320
this allowed me to study the developers

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
in their native habitat and obtain

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,000
firsthand account of complete

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,159
development life cycle from design to

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,200
release

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,119
this also allowed me to observe software

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
engineers as a collective which is

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
otherwise not possible using methods

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
like interviews or surveys

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,080
the team i joined consisted of five

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
software engineers one of whom had an

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
extensive background in security and

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
they followed the agile development

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,439
methodology

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
two months prior to me joining the

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
management team had initiated the

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
process of implementing secure software

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
development lifecycle

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
as a part of this initiative a virtual

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
application security team was formed

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
consisting of one software engineer from

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
each development team

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
this is when i joined the team as a new

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,680
hire participating in all development

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
activities as well as making

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
observations

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
the absent teams task began with two

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
newly introduced categories of tickets

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
csf and esps

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,079
during the first three months the

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
security tasks were not included as part

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,520
of the sprint

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
the developers working on the security

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
tickers did so individually and

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
considered it as burning cycles in free

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
time as a result the rest of the

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
development team didn't get much

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
visibility into the security work

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
however we began to observe a shift in

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
this pattern when the abstract engineer

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
was asked to create a threat model for

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,239
the product

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,239
he needed help from other developers to

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
fully understand the product in order to

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
create a proper threat model this

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
resulted in multiple discussions and

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
finally the creation of securities from

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,840
poker

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
for each security ticket developers

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
would clarify their understanding of the

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
problem and anonymously assign a risk

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
score until the whole team converged on

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
a common score

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,360
this process allowed the whole team to

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
better understand the security issue as

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
well as the abstract engineer to perform

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
a context-aware analysis of the issues

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
and identify suitable solutions

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
the score was then used in ticket

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
prioritization for the next print

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
over the next three months we observed

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
that the whole team start to bring up

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
security considerations on their own

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
leading to security driven design code

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
refactors and even the postponement of

91
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
his customer requested feature

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,319
overall 20 tickets were filed of which

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,920
eight were included in the sprints

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,720
during our field work

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,360
so what was driving this change

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,840
the role of management is clear most

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
importantly their push for security

98
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
established security as a deliverable

99
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
and put in the abstract structure to

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,159
support this

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,080
when we analyzed our data using the

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,480
general inductive approach we observe an

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
interesting pattern software engineers

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,959
assume different roles within the group

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
depending on the aspect of the product

106
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,080
in question

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
queries regarding any aspect are then

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
directed to the corresponding subject

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
matter expert

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,200
we also observed that there are

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,120
preferred sets of practices within the

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
team which are considered the way of

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
accomplishing some tasks

114
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
our data analysis shows that these

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,760
preferred practices evolve as a result

116
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
of an interactive learning dynamic

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
within the team

118
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
a learner seeking information acquires

119
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,120
it from the team

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
applying the knowledge in the context of

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,478
their own work improves their

122
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
understanding on the subject

123
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
then they are able to

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
participate in discussions and

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,520
contribute new information based on

126
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
their own experience this iterative

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
learning cycle sets up a common

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
understanding on the topic for the whole

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
team resulting in preferred practice for

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
any similar future task

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
and finally we find that having the

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
security expert within the team in a

133
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
co-creation setting allowed him to

134
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
establish a learning cycle for security

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
this was facilitated through security

136
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,479
scrum poker followed by the involvement

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
of whole team in security tasks

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
this learning cycle benefited all

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,479
developers as well as the security

140
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,880
expert and resulted in the establishment

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
of secure preferred practices

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
this is the beginning of a security

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,720
culture

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
we thank you for attending this talk if

145
