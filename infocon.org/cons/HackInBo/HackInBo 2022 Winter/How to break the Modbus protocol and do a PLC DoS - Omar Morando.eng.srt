1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,900
here we are

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,000
[Applause]

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
to generate pathos Thanks

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,939
a big round of applause for him thanks thanks

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,320
thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,240
thanks thanks thanks

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,340
demo bubble was to be able to

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,380
project So I can you have questions

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,439
and I'm leaving So thanks No I said a

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,940
friend is beautiful because you are  still so

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,860
many This is really very

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,660
nice the other thing I found you are

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,980
all still awake this is even more

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,600
nice because it means that whoever

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,980
presented before me

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,219
showed some nice stuff so very positive

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,500
So I have already lost 7 minutes in the  get this

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,879
stuff working So i'll try to

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,420
speed it up So a word about who i

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,700
'm marbling what i can do a number

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,520
of things it's not a big deal this i

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,260
am currently doing as a CTO

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,520
within a company called

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,079
sababa Security which is  specialized in

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,539
Cyber ​​Security If you want to contact

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,000
me somewhere you can find me

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,619
around then as he rightly said as we

28
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,500
said  o First

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,140
we have some live

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,119
stuff we have real stuff we have some stuff to

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,939
show you starting from an assumption i.e.

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,740
Starting from the fact of

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,659
critical infrastructures So so far we have seen

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,640
the activity director we have seen a

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,439
series of things this morning concerned the

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,939
safety of

37
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,700
Traditional infrastructures of the it world there is all

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,080
that parish of operational

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,600
Technology that is of the ot which encloses

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
a series of further

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,659
cross-sections a cross-section and the ICS against System another

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,880
cross-section can be the industry the IOT

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,159
can be the automotive in short But

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,939
let's see  today we focus on

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,100
ICS they are Industrial against System so

46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,140
why are they being attacked I will ask three or

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,759
four questions which I will answer by myself

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,220
and hoping that you will then share the

49
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,659
thought eventually if you do not

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,280
agree let me know then

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
why are the products

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,680
and  critical industrial environments the

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,799
challenge regarding ICS is a

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,840
very important challenge  critical infrastructures

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,160
are all those

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,420
infrastructures which unfortunately unfortunately

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,780
also include socio-political events that

58
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,520
I don't want to talk about which I absolutely don't want

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
to enter but since February

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,780
of this year we have seen it

61
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,920
critical infrastructures are all

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,780
those things that do  running things

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,660
in a very practical way

64
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,280
electricity distribution water distribution

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,620
rather than all

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,940
that can also be a

67
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,459
manufacturing industry that has

68
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,440
a critical impact and involvement in our

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,780
functioning there was an investigation by

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,700
IBM that did  beginning of year 19

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,019
let's take a look at

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,560
critical infrastructure what

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,840
the spill entails or attacks them and

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,420
vulnerabilities in monetary terms more than

75
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,459
$5 million that has been

76
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,540
spent or better of unspent damages

77
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,760
or

78
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,019
spill recovery  also quantifiable in the

79
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,660
impact on the market of what

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,940
can be a consequence here  then

81
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,739
critical infrastructure almost a third

82
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,260
of These have been attacked by

83
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,239
ransomware or other

84
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,580
destructive attacks critical infrastructure

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,180
Today they are threatened by by

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,220
attack groups are dealing with

87
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,680
social transformation industry 4.0

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
we connect everything we open the doors to

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,420
everything cool the  the fact of being able to

90
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,980
remotely see our plant, the production of

91
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,080
everything But the problem is that they

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,180
bring with them a series of aspects that

93
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
are not in line with

94
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,560
expectations, you are not ready for this

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
stuff here is a starting point  historic

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,760
stacks we don't know 2010 a

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
very complicated very complex attack one of the

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,239
most complex malware in its

99
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,760
how to say how it was articulated and

100
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,379
So much so that it is believed that there is a

101
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,940
government body behind it I didn't mention

102
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,620
it you know  story go

103
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,659
find some history and you know what is

104
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,239
behind it then why is it an

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,580
important element stacknett defined a

106
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,060
first aspect in  first of all

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,799
industrial products and architectures can be

108
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,478
attacked until the Prestachnett period

109
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,339
it was thought that it is something

110
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,260
unknown they are industrial protocols there is

111
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,780
security through obscurity there are

112
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,460
protocols that do not come No they are not

113
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,500
known they are protected in the Air Gaps  [ __ ]

114
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
we're safe actually stacks has

115
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,880
shown that all this stuff here was

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,419
violable the second big aspect I would like

117
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,400
to say merit but

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,699
negative value of stacknett and which made it

119
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,100
clear that with a software attack I can

120
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,620
have a hardware consequence that is with the

121
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,960
software I break  physical

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,660
mechanical stuff staxnet attacked a

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,000
nuclear power plant of a tanz in Iran

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,020
they exploited 4-0 of Windows they

125
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,540
went in search

126
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,620
spreading spreading in the

127
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
protected energy network spreading in

128
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,500
the PLC network Siemens s7300 and 400 they

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,139
went to do a rather

130
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,600
sophisticated job  of Man in the Middle

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
automatic that went to collect the

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,680
information exchanged  and among the PLCs the

133
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
scadaw systems in cc i.e.

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,400
control systems in the control room

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
attacked by altering the

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,320
rotation speed of the centers of the

137
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,900
nuclear plant until they broke

138
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,060
mechanically by reaching the resonance frequency.

139
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,580


140
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,800
it was

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,580
extremely destructive mind the beautiful thing

142
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,400
technologically speaking and that it was

143
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,039
so sophisticated that whoever

144
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,479
was inside the control room

145
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,820
of the Control Room did not realize

146
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,740
that something was wrong because

147
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,840
there was a replay Attack done  towards the

148
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
scada systems and therefore in fact

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,240
they noticed it When they saw smoke

150
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,539
Barrels noise when it was too

151
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,199
late after staxnet we had

152
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,080
other industrialists industrialize it is

153
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,180
malware carried out by an

154
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,180
attack group as you can read there that it has

155
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,340
a specific target

156
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,440
electrical distribution systems electrical distribution systems

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,820
means a

158
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,400
Power Plant  who does the distribution in

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,680
Italy we can have I don't know the Irene

160
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,419
Edisons and in all those who do

161
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,440
the electricity distribution therefore

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,319
carry the

163
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,139
current from the generation to the home

164
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,039
this industrial malware to this

165
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,380
specific target uses protocols

166
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,660
that are used in that environment and

167
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,160
therefore they are specific communication protocols

168
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,699
and it is able to do in

169
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,979
an automatic and specific way to

170
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,080
go and check the

171
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,300
switches of the substations are called the

172
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,520
safety rallies that is, in the large

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,919
medium-high voltage destruction plants there

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,600
are mega switches which are

175
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,340
the  equivalent of our domestic which,

176
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,180
however, occupy an entire room which

177
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,220
have very high sophistication elements

178
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,639
for which they are controlled over the network and

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
must be treated with a certain

180
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,220
industrial care is capable of

181
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,220
blocking or preventing these

182
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,479
switches from working

183
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,180
correctly  blocking works 2016

184
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,000
when appeared but  there is an Industrial

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,060
2 industry Reloaded which came out in

186
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,740
April this year a version 2

187
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,080
an evolution of industriere which

188
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,720
disappeared and did great

189
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,460
damage again I would say rather rather evident

190
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,759
third emblematic case traiton then

191
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,639
there are systems in

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,139
automation called Sis Safety Instruments

193
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,199
instrument System What are they in the

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,880
plants when there are

195
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,639
critical situations there is the classic

196
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,500
red button The emergency mushroom is created

197
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
no if you are in trouble press that stuff

198
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,400
there that stuff there when you press

199
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
that  safety switch there

200
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,020
are sophisticated mechanisms behind it

201
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,160
that prevail over the control

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,020
of the system and they cut

203
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,020
the power supply depends on the power they block a

204
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,660
system they close the valves it depends

205
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,180
a safety scenario is defined

206
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,800
when I press This

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,160
button which takes me to  a condition

208
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,199
of safety for people for

209
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,020
machinery this scenario is defined by

210
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,339
devices  i such as for example,

211
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,080
triconnex is a company that makes these Sis

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,599
that makes these objects that make sure that

213
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,059
if necessary I press the button and

214
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm more or less calm Triton is a piece of

215
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,500
malware that targeted these

216
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,160
objects of the tracolex and intervened

217
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,140
gods able to go and intervene on the

218
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,080
control stations of the Sis And it ensures

219
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,779
that when you press the red button

220
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,060
nothing happens That is,

221
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,420
the mechanical safety that you have

222
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,519
foreseen does not intervene just to go and avoid

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,820
that there is Dunno I don't know damage  a

224
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,680
rather important consequence

225
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,140
you can imagine that if I make a

226
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,060
safety switch that you have to

227
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,560
intervene because for example a

228
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
reactor is a chemical reactor is

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,760
reaching too

230
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
high a temperature and this switch does not

231
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,300
intervene the consequences can be

232
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,220
disastrous i.e. the impact is truly

233
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,839
remarkable  That's why they are called

234
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,160
critical infrastructure not only because

235
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,959
if there is a lack of electricity

236
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,600
in trouble but also  he because they have

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,839


238
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,680
extremely high involvements in the health of things and people

239
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,360
from then on the brothel

240
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,540
obviously continued a photo from 2022

241
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,260
until until until June we really have a

242
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,360
lot of industrialire 2 as

243
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,420
I told you they targeted via Sat  5,800

244
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,080
turbo diesel wind turbines wind blades

245
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,420
rather than attacks on the controller

246
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,540
the port of London but

247
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,180
the infrastructure or the plants

248
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,880
that produce and do something are

249
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,080
increasingly the target of attacks

250
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,880
because

251
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,180
Then the why is relatively

252
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,820
simple to understand First let's begin to

253
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,100
understand what  behind

254
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,899
an automation system there is an

255
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,680
industrial control automation system made up of n

256
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,320
components starting from the simplest and

257
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,959
going up sensors sensors are those things

258
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,500
that happen in a second they

259
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,360
ergono Sorry they convert a physical quantity

260
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,140
into a digital value a

261
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,899
temperature sensor  a pressure sensor

262
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,940
a

263
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,339
photocell Here we have represented a

264
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,200
small plant that you don't see yet,

265
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,740
only I can see it but take it for granted

266
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,540
There is a small simulator here that

267
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,180
shows a production plant sensors

268
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,459
actuators are instead the Rho ones where Ok

269
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,640
I have to advance a Mood to make

270
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,279
a motor turn there is an actuator c  'it is

271
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,500
something that an electronic component

272
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,019
that controls the rotation of the motor to

273
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,600
go up we have the DLC microcontrollers

274
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,220
programs ethologists controllers are in

275
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,740
fact small industrial computers

276
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,779
small in size not in

277
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,779
capacity that take charge of the

278
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,060
signals deriving from the sensors based on

279
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,680
the software that  I threw in the

280
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,000
application that I wrote

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,760
inside they implement the actuators that is

282
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,980
they do things that make these things

283
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,459
happen Then we find what

284
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,320
are called the HMs

285
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,899
operator terminals HM stands for Human machine

286
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,760
interface the man machine interface

287
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,700
up to a  few years ago the

288
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,500
automation processes were controlled with

289
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,320
so many synoptic tables  buttons lots of

290
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
lights if the red light turns on it's a

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,420
problem if the green light turns on everything is

292
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,220
fine press one button rather than

293
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,680
another this

294
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,480
electromechanical technology has

295
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,740
been converted into an operator panel for several years now

296
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,839


297
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,540
a

298
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,640
touch monitor device the bodywork at an

299
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,920
industrial level with  characteristics such as to

300
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
be able to put it on board an

301
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,019
automation system which, however, has a

302
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,820
graphic drawing on the synoptic diagram in

303
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,740
a digital version, it allows me to interact

304
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,380
with my system to go up again we have

305
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,360
what we are in the whole we find

306
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,279
communication protocols

307
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,839
Obviously these objects  they

308
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,480
must talk to each other a PLC can manage

309
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
a processing island Probably if

310
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,240
a plant I don't know about a

311
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,640
welding plant in a body shop I will have

312
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,560
an island that welds my side panels

313
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,660
an island that welds my frame an island

314
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,579
after that  I weld the roof an island

315
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,160
yet that will jump me something else every

316
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,380
single islands controlled by u  no or more

317
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,660
PLCs must coordinate with each other

318
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,839
finished 1 advances to the third conveyor and

319
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
attacks the second and so

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
on they must talk to each other they talk with

321
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
industrial protocols industrial protocols

322
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,920
are more than 150 and are

323
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,360
normally in most cases they

324
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,760
are

325
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,800
designed designed  from the seller from the

326
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,380
vendor from the PLC container if we are

327
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,000
in the simes house we find some that

328
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
are proprietary to Siemens plus other

329
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,660
standards if we are in Schneider

330
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,339
electriche we find some in the

331
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,139
Sneider house plus the standard ones and so

332
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,060
on there are consortia that

333
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,860
try to put  these

334
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,920
protocols together To make a Siemens PLC

335
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
talk with a foot or buy the

336
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,180
ABB ciroquel because otherwise it's a big mess

337
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,160
It's not said that my line my

338
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,139
production plant is all done

339
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,139
with the same types of PLC and still going up

340
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,519
oh well  the communication systems

341
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,200
until we arrive at the

342
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,880
scada the supervisor heats it up in the data

343
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,579
acquisition i.e. a comp  uter a software

344
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,500
that collects all the information

345
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
of the plant and macroscopically makes me

346
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,260
the control room that is the little man and I

347
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,220
always say lonino I don't have in a

348
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,959
disparaging sense but the person who is

349
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,820
working highly qualified who is

350
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,139
working on the control of the plant

351
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,180
Seated in his  control room at

352
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,660
ennemonitor who have

353
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,300
these computers equipped with the scada system

354
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,680
are able to detect

355
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
information give important set

356
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,060
alarm recipes and see below this is

357
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,200
a bit of an architecture of what we

358
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,120
could find on an AICS system

359
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
i.e. we find from left to right  to the

360
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
left we find the part Let's see if

361
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,200
I can have a pen without a

362
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,139
laser pen take it on trust

363
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,980
the what is called the

364
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,779
production network that is the production network

365
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,540
where I have the sensors where I have the

366
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,779
PLCs or workstations or perhaps

367
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,060
remote control without the  maybe

368
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,800
going up then I find the whole

369
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,779
supervisory control part the system

370
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,120
expires c  on Read the data of all the

371
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,100
production it gives me the history of the events

372
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,199
the history of the alarms It sets the

373
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,060
parameters blah blah and then it happens that

374
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,760
being within a company that

375
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,279
also does sales that manages

376
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
suppliers that manages the

377
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,300
personal whatever you want that

378
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,860
world somehow has to

379
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,959
interface with it and Here the

380
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,199


381
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,040
trouble begins plus obviously what already existed was not enough

382
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,339
and that was

383
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,779
critical enough in itself We are moving towards

384
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,180
an evolution the Edge world everything  all

385
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,779
cool all Claudio all open it's good

386
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,000
for certain technologies even if what

387
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
we've seen so far with those who

388
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,779
preceded me It's good within certain That is it's

389
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,519
good if you've done well If you haven't done

390
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,040
well It's not good it's bad in the

391
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,940
industrial world it's even worse Then

392
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,620
do you think it is difficult to attack an

393
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,620
ICS system tell everyone No it is not

394
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,899
difficult to attack a system and then

395
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,399
we will see it I will show you an attack

396
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,139
live anyway the rhetorical question and

397
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,639
no not  it is difficult to attack

398
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,680
an industrial control system a

399
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,839
critical system a critical infrastructure because

400
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,639
it is not difficult There are

401
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,620
typical characteristics of the ecs world

402
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,019
that make it

403
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,060
fragile make it robust from an electronic point of view

404
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,339
in its

405
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,199
process management in its work management

406
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,120
If  you put a computer it crashes

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,339
after three days If you put your foot on it it

408
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,760
works for 30 years without requiring

409
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,560
a shutdown once a restart with

410
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,779
Windows it would be unthinkable

411
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,760
something like this not to restart it At least

412
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
once a day if not twice with a PLC I do

413
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,339
it  I turn on today In 20 years I'm going to

414
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,139
see maybe remove the dust

415
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,420
above it doesn't suffer they are made on purpose

416
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,820
This is a big advantage for others

417
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,260
however a dramatic problem means

418
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,579
that I am using technology

419
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,699
that was developed twenty years ago 30

420
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,620
years ago and  it's still there spinning

421
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,060
I always give an example I worked 15

422
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,860
years Schneider electriche one of the

423
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,380
main Pl  ayer Worldwide

424
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,600
production of PLC

425
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,779
automation systems I left Schneider

426
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:54,060
on January 2005 and took

427
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,300
Turin money I took part in the design

428
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,680
of the Turin Metro

429
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,699
station automated control

430
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:00,959
systems from the

431
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,980
Turin Metro Metro which  without a

432
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,919
driver and therefore in the individual

433
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,599
metro stations there are doors

434
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,339
that open and close them based on the

435
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,260
fact that there is a train you know

436
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,380
that stuff there was automated

437
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,480
around the 2000s with a PLC Which I wo

438
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,280
n't mention that it came out of  production

439
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,760
several years ago it's been 22 23 years that the

440
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,339
subway works it didn't go to

441
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,459
attack it If you do a google search

442
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,460
of the product it runs Check

443
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,820
that stuff out there you'll find on a couple of

444
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,799
sites a list of a dozen

445
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,600
unfixed vulnerabilities because

446
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,400
obviously it's  out of production the film

447
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,679
doesn't touch anyone and that stuff there is one

448
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,900
it's one let's say it's an emblematic ius case

449
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,919
why  it involved me

450
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,480
directly but it's daily life I mean

451
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
they don't do it anymore they don't sin it anymore

452
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,460
but it still works Because it's his

453
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,440
20 30 it will go on for another ten years

454
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,360
maybe I don't know but the fact is that

455
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
this one this situation then

456
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,320
components are obsolete There  then it is a

457
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,539
second principle with a

458
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,900
fundamental principle that if something works,

459
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,799
don't touch it We are producing

460
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,080
h247 out of 7 because I have to do

461
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,700
a firmware update that

462
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,220
involves stopping production I am

463
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,200
in a blast furnace the blast furnace start-up process

464
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,820
is not a  stuff that turns the

465
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
key and starts it's stuff that takes me

466
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,179
a day to bring temperatures to

467
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,280
check us A mess then if that

468
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,100
works but who cares about the Cyber

469
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,400
i.e. conceptually I the company I produce

470
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
I have to continue producing they have

471
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,660
n't attacked me yet so far I'll take it then

472
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,880
possibly in dry consideration

473
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,039
in case this ever happens this

474
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,400
is unfortunately an understandable wrong thought

475
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,620
But not co  indivisible

476
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,240
at least for us who do this

477
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,860
job therefore updates

478
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,480
are not made unless strictly

479
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,840
necessary the protocols are weak and you

480
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,340
would like me to show you one in

481
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,520
particular there is another very

482
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,320
cool aspect that remote maintenance I

483
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,120
have a complex production line

484
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,919
at the end of my

485
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,620
Iper Galati production line that I had put in all

486
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,539
the protections in the world I'm going to

487
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,580
add a small object that

488
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,840
automatically attaches the labels to me

489
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,059
when the oil bottle is at the

490
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,919
end this small object is made by

491
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,360
a specialized local producer

492
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,919
in the oil bottle labeling machine

493
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,740
Who obviously

494
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,220
wants to control

495
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,539
his machine remotely for his convenience says Don't

496
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,460
worry I'll take care of that stuff there

497
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,740
made with a bale processor that

498
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,320
doesn't have the slightest integration

499
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
of protection protocols or

500
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,820
security is one of my

501
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,559
weak links in my

502
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,140
rom infrastructure  but a chain needs a

503
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,000
minimum weak link minimum condition

504
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,539
necessary to break it if I find one

505
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,960
I go bingo

506
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,900
So then architecture is a bit of

507
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,340
a thing like this it can

508
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,260
enter from all parts

509
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,120
remote center center with the keys as it

510
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,980
did  to bring the malware to the

511
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,900
station in the Lattanzi nuclear power plant

512
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,179
in Iran if it was protected nerd

513
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,760
Gap usb sticks thrown in the parking lots

514
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,460
thrown around given to events as

515
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,059
equimbo as a gadget and therefore Ah no [ __ ]

516
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,880
I don't have to say

517
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,320
Oh well I didn't take it anyway for

518
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,980
security Thank you anyway so in short, be

519
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,700
careful because everything is a vehicle for

520
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,080
interference everything can

521
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,539
potentially be something that

522
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,520
creates trouble for us So we have another

523
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,080
aspect that I always like to

524
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,179
underline time passes by I go fast and the fact

525
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,100
that it is very often those who maintain

526
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,380
the  installations Those who produce those who produce

527
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,419
obviously periodically within the

528
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,980
company take their own

529
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,320
laptop with the s

530
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,440
PLC programming software goes to the

531
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,380
plant connects to the PLC network

532
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,240
maintenance does the update does

533
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,280
what it has to resume your PC returns

534
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,980
and reconnects to Office Google Facebook

535
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,799
Net That is, everything is ok then don't have room

536
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,380
separation also  in

537
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,720
working conditions That is, not having a

538
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
pc dedicated to doing

539
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,679
inot stuff Air Gap and office stuff can

540
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,539
be a big problem very often it

541
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,940
happens that these worlds cross and

542
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,020
then collide with each other So

543
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,880
how do I find stuff autii

544
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,500
shodan Ok launch  chogan I write them I

545
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,900
put them TS Schneider tsx which is an abbreviation

546
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,520
of a Sneider PLC I find 84 PLCs

547
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,200
connected the IP addresses the

548
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,360
characteristics tells me it is a

549
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,299
communication module and ty4103 version of the

550
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,360
film 5.7 there is the IP address What can I

551
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,280
do  with this stuff here I classify

552
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,780
the objects In the meantime, out

553
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,520
of curiosity because I'm the

554
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,760
one who's curious, I open the programming software,

555
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,140
connect and go

556
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,520
see if this  The application is not

557
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
password protected I enter the

558
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,880
production system of that object

559
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,820
there many to be honest many of the

560
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,919
stuff you find on Chords No come on

561
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,780
leonine So they are some stuff put in

562
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,760
place to see what you are doing bla

563
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,280
bla but many  they are objects that

564
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,400
really work many of them are IOT devices

565
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,980
that really work that are

566
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,320
erroneously exposed on the network they do not have

567
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,600
a level of protection many of these

568
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,240
do not have an access password or if it is

569
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,360
an access password it is the equivalent of

570
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,740
admin admin Art  queues from inside

571
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,659
the system and therefore you manage to

572
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,539
enter a control system in a

573
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,539
PLC located in Brazil that you don't know what it

574
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,820
's doing it went to modify the

575
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,640
programming logic inside

576
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,320
so much you don't hear the bang because in

577
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,059
Brazil  the problem is that you have

578
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,159
solved it, that is, the mess

579
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,440
remains. So I was saying

580
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,360
industrial protocols, I take

581
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,360
the modbus as an example 1. Not by chance but because

582
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,299
the  modbus is a bit like saying a

583
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,659
mythological protocol for some reasons

584
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,580
and mythological protocol because

585
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,600
First of all it was born in 1979 I was 11

586
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,299
years old I didn't know modbus existed

587
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,179
but it

588
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:23,520
already existed it was invented by

589
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,820
modicon an American company

590
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,320
I don't remember  the name of the founder of the

591
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,700
small company called this

592
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,059
protocol modbus and that is why

593
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,600
we analyze it and it is probably the

594
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,080
most widespread protocol in the world of in the

595
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,059
context of industrial applications

596
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,820
in all its forms modbus is

597
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,460
present in the rs2 serials with

598
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,940
o technology  rs232 rs485422 support

599
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,760
you can find it modbus rtu mods Acid Plus

600
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,559
Modest tcp that is days in a thousand

601
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,799
variations but the protocol itself is

602
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,500
always the same bodywork and dressed in

603
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,240
a more cool or less way with the head

604
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,400
lowered or not but in fact it

605
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,320
always remains the same stuff  here what is the

606
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,960
problem that mobas was born with the

607
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
insecurity by design i.e. as

608
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,860
very many of the industrial protocols do

609
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,539
not  n has encryption no authentication

610
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,440
has weak weak concepts of

611
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,740
easily bypassable session and therefore it

612
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,580
goes without saying that being very widespread

613
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,799
one out of three I catch it I mean if at

614
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,440
33% of the market one somewhere I

615
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,860
find it a scale in modbus

616
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,140
a labeler  a pressure switch

617
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,059
somewhere so that I

618
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,418
always

619
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,860
catch it because it's cool mobbus because it allows

620
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,620
you not to be hyper

621
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,299
expert geeks to attack it take

622
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,820
the modbus manual read it there are

623
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,880
a series of functions

624
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,280
offered by the protocol itself that you

625
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,919
they say you want to write some outputs No

626
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,460
problem the function code to go

627
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,500
write stuff the writing to Colle

628
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,900
function code 05 where I am going to put it

629
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,960
that is the modbus communication package

630
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,140
Ok In the function column

631
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,960
I am going to read function code 05 I am going to

632
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,760
write some  stuff I want to write more

633
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,240
than one data at the same time AZ Wright

634
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,720
multipool 0 then 0 F That is, I'm going to

635
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,480
get function code 15 not being  or

636
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,940
necessarily authenticated if I

637
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,419
access the network in an assip mode on the

638
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,400
recipient recipient IP address

639
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,620
I throw that function code at him I do a

640
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,220
Floating that's what we're going to do simulator

641
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,179
So so let's say this in itself

642
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,100
is nice After that they said oh well

643
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,840
times go on we have to

644
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,940
serial 232 being faster the 485 sucks a bit

645
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,000
yes we can go

646
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,380
further multidrop but in short it's not enough

647
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,080
Then the same way is born P we

648
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,419
encapsulate the modbus on a protocol

649
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,520
yes we peed and we did

650
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,679
cool because at that point  we have much

651
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,980
more freedom much more speed much more

652
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,400
like saying the possibility of doing stuff

653
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,799
including We who want to attack it

654
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,840
So we also have

655
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,460
more options on a technology that

656
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,740
we know Consider that the modbus

657
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,020
allows for example to transfer 254

658
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,960
Bytes in its general package one of the

659
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,240
beautiful  attacks is the buffer overflow

660
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,520
on the size of the Stack went to

661
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,279
peck a list  I'm not saying

662
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,980
infinite but extremely long number of drivers

663
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,440
vulnerable to this type of attack

664
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,960
precisely because it hasn't foreseen

665
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,520


666
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,740
data sanitization products and stuff of this

667
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,919
kind under certain aspects There's definitely better yes The

668
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,020
technology goes on Oops there are so many

669
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,659
protocols  new encrypted there is

670
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,240
even beautiful stuff A Secur

671
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,940
mobbus which is a modbus inside a

672
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,000
TLS layer and therefore I already do a

673
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,440
series of stuff there that are a little more

674
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,539
complicated the problem what if I have

675
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,120
a 10 system  let's not say 30 years 10

676
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,200
years in the new stuff I put the modbus

677
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,000
How nice that smooth object I too

678
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,260
put the mobball Secur mobbucks with the

679
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,480
TLS but it has to communicate with the stuff from

680
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,120
10 years ago that the secul mod base

681
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,500
doesn't support it for me  and then of course

682
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,900
I have to reconnect with the normal bodbass

683
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,000
and here I get hurt or one

684
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
side or the other I always

685
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,020
get hurt so multidrop extremely

686
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,380
cool I can have as I said Modus  pcp

687
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,419
I can have modbus Plus I can have the

688
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,200
232 the 485 or gateways that

689
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,419
convert me from one physical layer to

690
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,820
another in short I can do many

691
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,860
things But the problem is always the same

692
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,480
So let's think about it a

693
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,279
vulnerability this vulnerability is

694
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,020
called  Ciriè 2018 78 55 What it is It is a

695
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,419
vulnerability that takes aim but not

696
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,220
because I want to take aim But

697
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,520
because a leg of Schneider Electric products is known they

698
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,320
are four families

699
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,400
of PLCs called m580 m340 Quantum and

700
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,539
Premium which incorporate this

701
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:24,240
one  modbus extension then I'll

702
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,919
tell you a little better and this

703
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,380
vulnerability that responds to the hip

704
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,020
exception vulnerable allows you to

705
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,760
make money Service of the PLC as

706
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,620
by sending it a set break

707
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,260
Point request formatted in a certain way a little

708
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,820
disheveled if they had gone  that

709
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,220
way there

710
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,320
the CPU fails

711
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,840
the PLC communication module fails There

712
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,640
is no way to position it to

713
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,260
recheck it to take control

714
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,299
remotely unless going to do a

715
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,580
physical reset, i.e. I cut off the power

716
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,860
supply, restore it or press the reset pistol

717
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,380
The problem is that if my system is a

718
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,000
remote system it means that I have to

719
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,500
take the car or the donkey if

720
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,980
perhaps it is  a plant at 1600 meters which

721
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,080
is generating It is a

722
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,940
hydroelectric plant I have to physically

723
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,940
show up on site switch off and

724
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,980
hang up so it is classified as

725
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,740
7.5 sufficiently high this

726
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,799
vulnerability I was saying concerns this

727
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,120
range of PLCs with a

728
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,940
further low-head version of

729
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,399
modbus which together with humas which  it is a

730
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,260
version of the modbus protocol

731
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,559
developed by Schneider Electric

732
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,100
I'll make it short What is yumas It is an

733
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,440
undocumented Schneider proprietary protocol

734
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,539


735
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,320
that concerns some versions of PLCs

736
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,840
developed with a software and an

737
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,640
operating system that we are Unity iOS version

738
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,399
2.6 or higher rather  that

739
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,419
programming prosecco together with

740
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,220
Unity Pro However just to say a

741
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,520
certain ga  Schneider's PLC mma which has

742
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,380
this extension humans And which allows you

743
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,899
to do more stuff

744
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,620
modbus itself allows you to do many things but

745
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,760
the extension that Schneider has

746
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,260
implemented in its products

747
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,140
allows you to do a lot more Here

748
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,820
it did  a bit of Reverse on some

749
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,860
are not all however it allows for example

750
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,919
to upload the download of the

751
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,200
programming software to protect the data

752
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,840
initialize the memory card ta

753
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,279
ta ta ta ta ta ta ta until

754
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,679
we get to 060 which the  set break

755
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,120
Point that the one that interests us

756
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,559
that is,

757
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,840
as it happens in the

758
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,799
programming software I am developing

759
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,320
an application I put a break Point the

760
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,419
program stops step by step I go to

761
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,279
see what happens with a PLC I can

762
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,779
do the same stuff I have mine

763
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,520
Engineering station that allows me

764
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,140
to program the PLC I

765
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,600
physically connect to the PLC I put a break point

766
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,940
in the PLC program I send it to Run

767
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,340
the PLC program stops and I

768
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,380
remote  to with my pc is and by step I'm going to

769
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,880
see the next commands to understand

770
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,399
if my system my

771
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,440
programming my application is working

772
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,460
correctly Bueno Then

773
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,279
the structure

774
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:13,440
of the request to set break Point to

775
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,080
this format and allows you

776
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,260
to go and set

777
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,299
a break Point at a certain

778
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,580
memory address What happens if this

779
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,860
memory address is a somewhat silly beginning of memory

780
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,899
what I said

781
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,360
before happens i.e. the break Point is made on

782
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,600
an instruction 0 from there on

783
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,720
muerto i.e. there is no  'is hope to

784
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,559
restart my system in Python this stuff Ok

785
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,740
then I'll show you live So let's

786
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,100
imagine to carry out an attack on an

787
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,320
industrial network on an ICS plant what

788
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,299
do I do let's imagine to have access to

789
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,279
a network I can get access

790
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,740
remotely in VPN physically whatever you want I

791
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,279
'm an Insider I'm someone who

792
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,020
does maintenance I can

793
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,700
get into the network the first thing

794
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,440
I do of course  body is what I would do

795
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,640
Normally during a pente test

796
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,659
rather than any activity

797
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,700
I scan I don't know which

798
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,039
devices are there I launch a scan

799
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,539
I go to see the devices I find

800
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,299
in my infrastructure Modus offers

801
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,820
many interesting ruins so it

802
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,740
allows me to identify the same height

803
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,299
What are the devices connected

804
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,419
After that I can do for example trying

805
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,460
to replicate the stacks on duty

806
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,039
I get in between and try to understand the

807
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,260
two objects the devices what they

808
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,360
say to each other I save this

809
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,580
information on File I do a

810
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,039
dumping  of the behavior of the data

811
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,500
exchanged Then I maybe do an

812
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,500
attack a replay Attack on the specific

813
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,779
better with the slides that are there so

814
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,039
let's go and see directly in

815
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,720
detail The first thing I do a

816
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,600
scan on the net Python script that

817
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,640
tells me look what we have found for

818
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,500
example at  that IP address I found

819
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,940
a PLC that has these characteristics

820
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,679
This is the modbus ch  and it allows me to

821
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,720
do it with the humes extension it tells me it's

822
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,700
a Schneider Electric PLC it's something

823
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,059
called

824
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:08,520
bmp584020 rather than the firmware

825
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,140
version 0 3 10 cool because it's

826
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,000
vulnerable so we're fine with it let's

827
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,159
find out it tells me What is the  name of the

828
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,140
project tells me with which development

829
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,580
development systems was carried out

830
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,919
tells me how long no one has been putting

831
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,360
their hands on it this information which

832
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,399
apparently is of little significance

833
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,220
for an attacker is really

834
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,659
very important information because it

835
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,039
allows us to understand how long it

836
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,840
hasn't been  maintenance has been done on that on

837
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,700
that system on that PLC It has been a long time since

838
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,460
no one has had their hands on it is a lot of

839
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,899
information that shodan can provide me

840
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,820
So remotely at home comfortable you

841
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,340
already know it Ok possibly if they are logically exposed on the

842
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,260
network After that I can do

843
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,539
as I said the  my main the Middle I

844
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,399
'm going to get the dumping of

845
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,100
everything that is exchanged I acquire it

846
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,000
with small packets and the  analysis of the

847
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,580
packages via Tiny Python script with

848
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,899
Scapi rather than I can develop

849
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,480
what I want I can do for example

850
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,899
a replay Attack towards the

851
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,820
control system i.e. I amped

852
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,940
everything that the two objects have exchanged I

853
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,280
block

854
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,859
PLC communication  and supervision system and it's me

855
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,080
who with my PC as an attacker does a

856
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,239
she attacks towards the scada system it

857
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,560
means that the system expires at that point she

858
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,099
sees coherent production data but they

859
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,719
are fake data that I am sending to her

860
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,379
In the meantime I attack the PLC  and I modify

861
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,739
my system

862
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,000
so that the PLC has a

863
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,639
different behavior and then I go wild with my

864
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,560
beautiful

865
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,020
moneywoman, I risk

866
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,280
exploiting this vulnerability

867
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,520
which I indicated first as 78 55 by

868
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,379
making a set break point on the address of

869
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,080
memory obviously that puts it in crisis

870
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,659
at that point the system crashes if I

871
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,280
'm continuing to do the replay Attack

872
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,420
towards the system expires obviously

873
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,800
inside the control room they

874
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,080
may not realize it

875
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,160
I understand it but then from the fact that

876
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,260
nothing works anymore so

877
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,880
if the direction assists me We also have the

878
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,540
live simulator on the central monitor

879
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,500
moments of suspense Here it is pappa pappa

880
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,660
Here it is Then you more or less see it

881
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,119
So  here you see there is a simulator of

882
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,960
a plant ok So you see that there is

883
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,880
this and blessed I was saying before

884
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,060
hmi module that is something that

885
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,859
allows me to view interact with

886
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,839
the operator ok So it allows you to

887
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,760
see what happens it allows me to

888
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,800
understand  the operating status and

889
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,460
so on what you see above

890
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,460
with the green tab and the

891
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,380
Schneider Electric plcm 580 something you find

892
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,060
in systems that are also very important,

893
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,180
that is, it is small in size but

894
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,119
in this case the more true the

895
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,920
dimensions are not  count in the sense that it is

896
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,260
an object with a very large capacity that is very

897
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,420
expandable and capable of going to

898
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,619
control even very

899
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,140
complex systems very  articulated with

900
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,660
hot or stand-by backup network redundancy I

901
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,800
have advances from iocea you can really do a

902
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,839
thousand things you can handle more than

903
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,119
64,000 defendants so it's

904
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,880
definitely really powerful and complex and here

905
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,920
's our simulator of the system

906
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,079
I'll put in a little piece of him  it goes

907
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,560
on it makes me it makes me a fake

908
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,839
production a mover there is a

909
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
small milling cutter a conveyor belt the

910
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,680
photocell which is my sensor says

911
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,020
you have arrived there they trap you above then

912
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,240
I go ahead I send you station 2 there is

913
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,520
a small drill  spinning there too

914
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,579
sled Slider comes back

915
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,760
conveyor roller push gets to the

916
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,160
bottom of it rolls over obviously because it

917
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,520
couldn't not happen Here she is and she

918
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,099
says We've done a piece

919
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,140
more or less We've almost done a piece

920
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,280
so this is what happens no And so

921
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,760
far good

922
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,339
So since it went well he

923
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,520


924
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,220


925
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,859


926
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,720


927
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,540
'd close it here No I'll do the CT [ __ ] you don't trust me either then so you see them there One and two over there then

928
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,640
basically

929
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,040
there are three scripts that I made one is

930
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
called modbus Scan So we want to

931
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,540
go and see what we find on the

932
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,520
network I found the access so

933
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,320
somehow I try to understand what

934
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,619
happens So let's launch this stuff here let

935
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,500
's launch it like I'm doing that is  with

936
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,359
sudo

937
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,760
because obviously

938
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,000
I make requests that require

939
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,380
privileges And then he says Then

940
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,420
I scan address two

941
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,099
I can't find anything address 3 I find

942
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,800
stuff address 4 isn't there 5 doesn't

943
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,500
answer me 10 isn't there  it's 20 there isn't 55

944
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,560
not even 58 Puff find me something

945
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,720
then what happened As I said

946
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,460
I take one at random I take this one

947
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,920
but then I leave the frame they

948
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,480
told me I must not move between the two

949
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,579
Besides the Two Columns  okay You don't

950
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,900
miss much So practically

951
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,240
up there he says I imagined doing

952
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,800
a scan I could have done a /24

953
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,960
but there's no time so take it

954
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,000
on faith I put a

955
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,119
dozen indi behind  rizzi finti finds me at the top Ben

956
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,560
tornam Schneider Electric network

957
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,280
the address 3 port 502 because the port

958
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,460
of the modbus tcp and I see that there is a

959
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,220
device called xbt gt4340 What is the

960
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,380
hmi panel you find there at the top

961
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,300
left  with the graphic drawing it tells me

962
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,339
that you are a version of the firm that the 68

963
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:42,300
62 number 12 Google vulnerability 62812

964
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
btg exploit something found Ok

965
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,980
Then there is also the macadress because

966
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,540
if I have to make myself Obviously a main the

967
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,280
Beat obviously I need it if I make the

968
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,480
Spooky app in  these Robinias are a bit like this but

969
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,420
I still need them badly it doesn't make a macadas it

970
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,339
can always be useful at address 58

971
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,859
As I said it tells me that there is another

972
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,980
stuff which instead is the PLC the cool one 580

973
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,740
with a certain vulnerable firmware version

974
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,680
at 3.10 then Schneider says

975
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,820
when we reported the

976
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,160
vulnerability he says don't worry with 3.2

977
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,520
Fix everything we're registered It's not

978
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,619
true we need to do more and moreover

979
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,579
it hasn't solved But oh well Anyway oh well

980
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,380
they probably did  you solved I think

981
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,359
but 3.2 is also a bit critical

982
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,820
So ehm Project information

983
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,160
pro programming software version

984
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,839
and version 15 must be the project

985
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:31,980
In short blah blah what I told you

986
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,520
before we gathered them by very simply making

987
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,240


988
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,700
Buffon requests with  this structure here what

989
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,619
I'm making are standard requests

990
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,460
Ok you can find them formatted make the

991
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,020
requests it obviously gives you answers

992
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,880
Otherwise I wouldn't be

993
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,760
we won't make requests and on the basis of

994
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,320
this we identify the type of object

995
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,480
ok

996
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Bueno then

997
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,960
among mine in my Arsenal  opportunities

998
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,300


999
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,940
or even a Floating Attack What is

1000
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,400
Modus we said does not require

1001
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,200
authentication and allows me to go and

1002
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,760
write stuff as I want

1003
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,900
so now I will send commands addressed directly to the PLC for a certain

1004
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,740
number of seconds

1005
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,500


1006
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,520
overwriting its registers

1007
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,280
memory and the system will do things that are not the

1008
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,380
ones foreseen, i.e. it will do

1009
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,420
things that  I tell him why I'm

1010
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,980
making an attack period the

1011
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,520
paper thread has arrived I throw a cascade of

1012
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,560
data that overwrites those

1013
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,020
written by the PLC set to the PLC and

1014
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,579
therefore my system will do other

1015
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,760
stuff

1016
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,440
let's try it

1017
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,680
if you Look on the screen it

1018
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,700
starts  turning everything a bit muzzo

1019
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,920
That is, it's no longer doing the cycle you

1020
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,020
see it's moving a bit all

1021
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,079
random here Obviously it's a small it's

1022
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,640
a small example so it's not like

1023
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,320
I could do other stuff the

1024
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,839
interesting thing is that on the other  part I

1025
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,540
launch my session open and

1026
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,520
Finally do a nice denari of service

1027
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,960
so I send the break Point command to

1028
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,520
an address formatted in a certain way

1029
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,640
and the PLC is nailed down you don't see it

1030
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,060
so if you make an effort you can see the

1031
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,560
stuff right  above top top

1032
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,180
top there are three red dots in a triangle

1033
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,359
on the PLC those three red dots

1034
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,240
mean yes plus in folt communication module

1035
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,479


1036
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,720
PLC by damn good director

1037
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,240
Ethernet in folt CPU in  folk everything in

1038
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,400
folt

1039
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,020
fonsi That is wrong there are no cases

1040
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,940
So you have to go and therefore

1041
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,220
also all the sessions everything

1042
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,780
I have open If I tried to connect

1043
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,579
with the programming software I

1044
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,099
would not be able to reach the PLC because the

1045
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,380
Ethernet communication module is now

1046
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,480
nailed and therefore physically I

1047
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,980
have to go turn off and on

1048
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,880
reset or do other stuff

1049
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,060
very well then and therefore

1050
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,320
two slides I'm done and therefore we are

1051
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,079
[ __ ] no in the sense we know then yes in the

1052
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,420
sense we are not in a

1053
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,220
particularly brilliant situation but we are

1054
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,680
loopholes in the sense of everything

1055
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,480
that we have now said everything

1056
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,339
that he has tried to show you and

1057
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,260
I hope I have managed to convey

1058
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,960
at least as General concepts in order

1059
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,720
to understand how important it is to prevent

1060
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,180
rather than cure because when I

1061
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,619
try to cure it is late that is

1062
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,060
that object nailed there

1063
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,579
I have to take away tonight Ok not the eight of them

1064
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,500
physically but if I go  to do a

1065
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,300
Floating a taxo plant like starks did

1066
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,640
no this presumption but like

1067
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,099
staxnet did I'm going to alter the

1068
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,800
behavior of a plant of a

1069
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,720
plant of I don't know what and I'm going to

1070
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
do physical damage with

1071
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,740
extremely important consequences Ok

1072
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,900
then  I have to prevent how

1073
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,220
I prevent I can prevent at an

1074
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,680
organizational level I do a Security Assessment

1075
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,720
in the first step I try to understand how I'm

1076
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,000
combined I'm

1077
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,460
in a bad way a disaster is very important or almost right

1078
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,920
I try to understand it with a Security

1079
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
Assessment I try to have a

1080
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,020
security-oriented approach  risks

1081
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,420
I do specific training for the

1082
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,700
ti world Cyber ​​training is good

1083
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,740
stuff and

1084
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,380
Cyber ​​OT training

1085
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,599
should be done more and more And one more thing and even more should be done

1086
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,180
because there is no culture in the ti world like

1087
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,579
there is  you have very little in the it world I do

1088
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,040
supplier management an asset

1089
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,099
inventory at a technical level

1090
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,119
vulnerability scanning you don't do it  or a

1091
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,880
Pain test on the system itself I sell

1092
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,859
in the aggressive maptop they are a module that

1093
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,660
can be messed up however a Secure you

1094
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,460
assessor I do stuff and

1095
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,940
above all I do protection with

1096
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,000
dedicated tools last slide you can

1097
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,359
do an excellent segmentation of the network

1098
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,520
you can do a  network protection

1099
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,220
I have to use components born for the

1100
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,940
industrial world I can manage IPS firewalls they

1101
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,940
must be industrial i.e. they

1102
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,800
manage standard protocols plus the

1103
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,859
ability to perform packaging

1104
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:30,480
inspection on devices net profit on all those you

1105
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,180
want there are as I said more than 150

1106
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,460
protocols to go to  support I

1107
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,640
have to go and predict that everything

1108
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,180
is segmented in the forgiveness of levels

1109
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,079
from zero to 5 3.5 of m Z put

1110
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,839
what you want in it every single layer

1111
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,180
must do exactly what is needed but

1112
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,460
nothing more I can

1113
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,200
compartmentalize as if it were a ship

1114
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,420
rather than a submersible

1115
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,359
airtight if I have a leak or a space that

1116
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,720
is attacked but maybe the r  this

1117
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,460
is still functional for me I'm not going to

1118
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,960
compromise the entire infrastructure

1119
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,640
This is the concept of segmentation

1120
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,579
so separate myself from the OT part have

1121
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:15,740
awareness have know-how

1122
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,020
want to invest want to

1123
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,460
leave because we're putting our hands

1124
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,020
I finished

1125
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,980
very good Thanks

1126
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,319
enough
