1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,900
now

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,039
[Applause]

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,980
invitation Davide to novazzi Welcome Davide

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,520
Thanks

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,740
Davide will tell us about the title of his

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,660
presentation of the firewall is dead long

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,579
life to the firewall and please

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,379
Enjoy Thanks

9
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,260
Ok

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,860
good You hear me

11
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,800
Well First of all I notice Mario to

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,020
all to thank you so much for

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
having come here today so numerous

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,480
You are really so

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,399
many my Talk today is a bit so

16
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,359
provocative in the title but obviously

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,099
yesterday my friends in Palo Alto in

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,360
Fortini called everyone they

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,360
told me wrong that go and calm down it's the

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,740
firewall like  We'll see at the end of

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,080
this Talk it continues to serve

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,479
God forbid there are simply

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,100
situations in which perhaps we need to

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
go a little further and a little I'd like to

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,060
put aside this

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,920
eccentric network concept of many companies that

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
make Security and talk a little  a little more about

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,720
how to do Security in a

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,460
modern context with micro services and Cloud Based

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,040
let me introduce myself I'm Davide

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,659
in everyday life I work in

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,560
Google as Security lead and

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,659
today I'm not here wearing the Google hat I

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,380
want to specify it and

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll try to tell you a bit

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,119
about my vision of things so a

37
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,460
minimum of agenda I'll start for a moment with

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,479
explaining to you what this

39
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,340
classic infrastructural concept is especially

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,060
called the  castle

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,000
or fort approach that I imagine many of

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
you already know. Then I'll

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,038
move on to a bit of budd World Zero network Zero

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,560
Trust applied however to the network not

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,319
so much to the identityes and then I'll

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,360
show you a couple of scenarios in which

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
to then apply in a

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,660
these things that I'm going to tell you are a little more

49
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,940
concrete And then I'll close with the

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,040
enforcement part because it's really very

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,660
important Ok draw the rules but

52
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,459
then we also need to enforce them

53
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,360
well let's start bomb

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,599
the castle approach

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,459
this is the approach  Castello la proscia

56
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,260
Castello means building an

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,440
infrastructure I have my corporate network

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,319
super segregated

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,459
with external firewalls  the

60
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,920
super-optimized perimeters paid a lot of

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,760
money that have a bomb performance

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,900
but then when you're inside you're inside

63
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,120
When you're inside all truster When

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,340
you're inside and you've managed to get into the

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,180
company you've plugged in the

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,879
Dylan Ethernet cable the dhcp has given you an

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,159
address see  everything when you connect

68
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,760
to the VPN Yes you do multifactor Pierre

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,159
authentication Everything you want but

70
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,440
when you're inside you're inside you move

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,300
horizontally as you want

72
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,099
more or less eh Then there are those who obviously do better

73
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,739
but let's say that when you go

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,319
a little  around you see a lot of them no And

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
this is the approach that

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,319
I would like to question a bit today

77
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,620
basically the one that

78
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,019
in practice makes us creak a bit

79
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,099
when we then have to get

80
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,360
out of the information No from this

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
cursed firewall why not  I know if

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,799
anyone has ever gone to see the logs of

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,720
a firewall.

84
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,140


85
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,940


86
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,140
out of actionable useful information

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,899
Boh someone we managed

88
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,959
So the problem is not the firewall The

89
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,519
problem is neither do them nor who

90
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,840
manages them the problem is how they are

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,599
applied no so

92
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,980
this is the classic scenario no

93
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,959
in which I have my nice firewall filters

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,899
everything though  then

95
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,440
VPN at the Lau Here it is laiani I

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,759
also looked for online statistics to

97
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,820
understand Dunno a number a magnitude of

98
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,400
How many Enterprise files have

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
at least one Eni inside therefore a rule

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,139
basically that tells me that if you

101
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,680
arrive from the VPN you can go to

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,300
any destination behind that

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,699
firewall on any port

104
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,560
This obviously All right for VPN

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,479
convenient No because then I don't have to

106
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,160
segment the network whoever works as a

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,199
system administrator must see everything no but it's

108
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
not just for VPN because whoever has

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,400
never found a situation in which c  'is

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,500
the application in which the company has

111
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,660
invested the last six months of work

112
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,860
and obviously the security did not know

113
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,479
anything about it  application

114
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,060
two weeks after launch they try to

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,040
bring it into production to do tests and

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
I fail you because there is a firewall

117
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,780
Eh but who knew there was this stuff And

118
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,580
so what to do Well but try to put

119
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,840
an Eni Let's see if  it works It works

120
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,720
and then who takes it off with the plane you come Yes

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
yes then let's do the analysis let's

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,280
figure it out eh but use the low doors use the

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,380
high doors But yes no now oh well it's the

124
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,080
Change Freeze we are under Christmas Cyber

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,820
Monday don't touch  nothing that then

126
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,220
breaks everything perfect you keep that stuff here

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,539
for the next 10 years

128
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,160
and someone tried to upgrade

129
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,139
the firewall firmware and I was talking

130
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,940
just yesterday

131
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes that's fine I have active Active so I

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,860
start turning one off I do the  'upgrade

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,320
then I restart it go to

134
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,380
another Eh but the sessions that were on

135
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,000
pass the session from 1 to another

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,220
someone who has ever tried yes maybe

137
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,800
Pass but then I have to declare it to the board

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
at the changeboard because then maybe I give

139
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,240
the application service  it breaks they kick

140
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,860
my ass I have to do it on Saturday

141
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,199
night on Sunday but who makes me do it and if

142
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,300
I have the active passive the passive goes up

143
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,820
true when I switch

144
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,120
Boh maybe not so here we are

145
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
in the situation where my

146
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
beautiful wall the one that was supposed to

147
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
defend me from everyone pulls down the

148
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,720
drawbridge because the vulnerabilities

149
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,180
start to appear there too eh

150
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,180
last example then I swear I'll stop Print

151
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,300


152
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,300
timer yes vulnerability

153
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,039
CV very serious but we should be

154
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,400
calm guys i.e. the laptop there is the

155
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,819
personal firewall yes  connect to a

156
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,940
network that there is a firew that protects me

157
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,860
the servers are ardenized therefore the

158
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,020
spoiler disabled print from the

159
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,319
server is disabled true the spoiler

160
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
and they are behind double bastion That is,

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,180
I have two to do one not one

162
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,880
is true

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,600
There is  one so a client

164
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,840
is enough which is a problem here I have Eni Eni and

165
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,900
nothing

166
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,639
It doesn't even work here so nothing new I don't even have anyone who makes

167
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,199
firewalls nor who in there with who uses them

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,460
but simple  eminently this to

169
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,280
exemplify a concept no that the

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,699
concept of truster network in 2022

171
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,319
is no longer that of the borders of my

172
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,180
company I can no longer think that by

173
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,460
putting a firewall on the border of

174
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,720
my company I can be calm

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,460
because First of all who knows what the

176
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,080
border of  my company we are

177
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,860
all going to the Cloud somehow

178
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,319
non-instantiable pass services inside the

179
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,319
vp pc epai on the internet

180
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,060
hybrid infrastructures a bit in the Cloud a

181
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,720
bit a prem 14,000 spas services those

182
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,860
we know about those we don't know about

183
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,840
how it why then the business

184
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
We all know it does what it

185
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,539
wants

186
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,300
No more let's add a complication

187
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,560
than the one I would like to focus on

188
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,720
today

189
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,419
microservices ok So my

190
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,759
application that I develop from now

191
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,139
on will hardly be

192
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,380
monoliths on VMs they will easily be

193
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,340
in microservices architectures on

194
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,440
cubernetis  probably fine i pull up

195
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
applications on cubernetis i have my

196
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,560
firewall around But in there c  what

197
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,199
happens, that is, sooner or later I have to open the

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
one with the box I have to go

199
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,259
put my nose in it as Security

200
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,000
otherwise they keep throwing me up

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,139
applications on applications on

202
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,240
applications that talk to each other

203
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,020
and there is no firewall there we are one

204
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,000
level  above

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,799
And all this is happening in the room

206
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,319
in scale it simply means that

207
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,279
in these micro services they are not static

208
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,700
they move they are brought into production

209
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,339
or one two weeks

210
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,220
is a mess they scale up in the

211
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,300
sense that they go into vertical scalability

212
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,880
and therefore it is difficult to do Security

213
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,339
the goal in here is to do

214
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,820
Security But doing Security at scale

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,560
and following at scale means I

216
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,300
can't start hiring a set Ops

217
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,140
engineer or otherwise a Security

218
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,399
native every time a

219
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,420
new application arrives once you

220
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,940
change technologies every  time a

221
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,399
new development means that the

222
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,019
security I have to put inside these damned

223
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,580
micro services and it must be automatic

224
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,100
de  ve climb with them

225
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,700
I can't think of going as a

226
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,440
Security Team to get my hands on the

227
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,760
application and see what they do and

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,380
how they move because otherwise

229
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,720
he'll go crazy No this is today's goal

230
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,040


231
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,660
so to make a summary This is a little

232
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,040
drawing  that will accompany us a bit

233
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,760
during this chat essentially

234
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,220
what we have defined up to now is

235
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,760
that the Policies were those firewalls

236
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,860
defined at the border the blue box inside

237
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,760
especially if a

238
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,580
microservices infrastructure the firewall does nothing

239
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,459
and communications travel free They travel

240
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,959
free until

241
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,360
someone arrives and does a bad thing because at

242
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,860
that point only one of those

243
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,920
applications is compromised only one

244
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420
of those pieces of that pipeland is

245
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,580
compromised manages to push something in

246
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,540
production that shouldn't be

247
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,480
pushed well lateral movement But not even

248
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,160
to say

249
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,760
and this I mean not  is that it

250
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
only happens not to those who do not do security well

251
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,680
It happens to everyone This is the

252
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,420
cl example  I assure you that I like to mention Operation

253
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,339
Aurora in 2009 been sponsors

254
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,560
the 20 largest Techs in the world have been

255
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,899
victims of this stuff no And that's where

256
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,700
the whole zero Trust mess started

257
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,160


258
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,180
continuous authentication and everything no

259
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,399
So These things happen happen

260
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,839
to adults and  they happen to the little ones you have to

261
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
think about it really seriously

262
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,640
well

263
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,339
and here we come to the password 03st

264
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,860
network and today I don't want to talk to you about

265
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,740
zero Trust in terms of and you have to

266
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,240
make the user do the Factor authentication band

267
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
you have to study the context

268
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,660
No I want to do zero Trust  on services

269
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,240
03 on the application So what I

270
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,339
want to do is that when

271
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,279
my bad application arrives the

272
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,079
bad guys are always inside they are

273
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,660
also outside but they are mainly inside

274
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,060
what I want to do is simply

275
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,560
that my security policies are able

276
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,920
to block it  That is, I don't want that

277
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,060
when someone is

278
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,820
compromised it happens sooner or later,

279
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,380
I don't want them to be able to do it

280
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,880
sideways I don't want it to be able to

281
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,019
compromise the others and above all

282
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,399
I want to realize that it has been

283
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,760
compromised

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,360
So what I want to do is go

285
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,459
a little beyond the firewall it must remain

286
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,740
that is my Policies around here the red ones it's

287
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,360
not that I have to forget about it they

288
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,459
must  continue to stay but my

289
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,620
point is I have to move forward with respect to

290
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
this network centrism I have to move

291
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,680
forward because I can no longer

292
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,920
use IP address as source

293
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,380
of authorization authentication How

294
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,540
do I do in firewalls No i.e. in firewall

295
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,100
I put source IP address I put

296
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,600
l  'destination IP address I use the

297
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,940
port but what the hell address do

298
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,560
these microservices have in front of us

299
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,820
Probably a Reverse proxy behind them they

300
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,279
threaten and start scaling up and

301
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,200
down left and right I ca

302
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
n't know I can no longer work on the IP address

303
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,500
as a source  of authentication

304
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,079
authorization So what I have

305
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,180
done to date for the last 10 years

306
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,880
I guess

307
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,100
if q  ua inside someone hasn't received

308
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,200
at least one commercial email telling you you

309
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
have to adopt the zero Trust

310
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,899
mind So what we've tried

311
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,940
to do in the last Boh Yes exactly 10

312
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,360
years on users so

313
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,339
stop relying only on the username and password

314
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,079
give them a  stronga identity perhaps

315
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,420
cryptographic try to understand the

316
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,060
context in which they work to

317
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,380
allow them access to the

318
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,120
corporate network Here I have to do the same

319
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,040
thing

320
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,959
on my applications I cannot

321
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,040
assume anything I cannot define

322
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,959
that just because an application has taken

323
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,040
an IP address  just because

324
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,600
an application running in my

325
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,560
Cluster is somehow trusted it must

326
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
have a strong identity or it must have a

327
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,300
cryptographic identity I can't

328
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,339
just say that that

329
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,139
application Trusts just because it has taken

330
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,820
an IP address

331
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,040
the images and the infrastructure they

332
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,779
run on  these applications must be

333
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,420
what I decided I must be

334
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,700
sure that

335
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,700
that application is  running because I

336
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,560
released or pushed a secure image

337
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,320
checked following all my

338
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,540
security tests and above all this

339
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,480
stuff I can't do it by hand I

340
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,940
can't put myself there do the checks do the

341
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,980
production release by hand I can't

342
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,720
apply the policies  by hand I can't

343
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,660
do checks by hand they are too many or

344
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,160
any company is becoming a

345
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,260
given Company so this stuff can only

346
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,880
get worse

347
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,579
so if we take a classic

348
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,620
development cycle we divide it into two The

349
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,899
first part is Oh well development precisely

350
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,560
created the limbs made and  I artifact But

351
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,120
all my security tests my

352
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,300
vulnerabilities ascaning

353
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,100
that compositions

354
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,440
[Music]

355
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,959
static code analysis tests

356
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,519
that all I want to do I get to a

357
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,620
certain point where my pipeline

358
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,740
will create my image head So that at

359
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,600
that  point my transferred image that

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,500
will be signed the Trastevere signs

361
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,839
become my laptop of the Zero

362
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,220
Trust model So if in the Zero Trust model I

363
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,199
verify  or username password I check that the

364
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,360
laptop that wants to access my

365
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,519
company network has the certificate on board it

366
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,740
has the latest version of

367
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,779
the antivirus the patches installed This is the model

368
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,060
no This is the same thing I have to do with

369
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,800
my container images I have to

370
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,380
check that it has  the latest version

371
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,779
of the libraries none of the libraries is

372
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,940
buggy the security texts have

373
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,100
passed and all this is

374
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,019
digitally signed and then he pushes it into

375
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,579
production

376
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,699
this is the most total mess No I

377
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,240
brought it into production

378
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,579
And what's going on the Push into production is

379
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,320
stuff starts to scale start to scale

380
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
up start to scale down according

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,380
to workloads left and right

382
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,100
horizontally so

383
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,360
i need to be able to keep control

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,100
i can't think of applying policies

385
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
that are valid for all seasons

386
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,479
no

387
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,339
how do i do it here it starts  to

388
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,139
throw a word that is the service

389
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,360
smash the service mesh is the one that has to

390
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,760
be my best friend in this case

391
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,019
so i have to aff  give me

392
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,019
an infrastructure that underlies

393
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,040
cubernetis that underlies all my

394
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,600
infrastructure microservices that becomes

395
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,339
must become my best friend the

396
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,860
Smash service now we'll talk about it later

397
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,079
So basically This is our

398
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,480
scenario what we have already seen

399
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
before

400
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,399
what do I do if I can't put  the

401
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,079
Policies out

402
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,639
and I will put the policies in the services no

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
So These are my application

404
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,019
what do I do I had my own Entire

405
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,399
development chain the first thing that

406
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,600
occurs to me to do is simply

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
Before signing that image I throw

408
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
mine in it  security police that

409
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,560
require me that and all connections

410
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,660
from AND to that service must be

411
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,579
encrypted and all connections must

412
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,959
be authenticated all they

413
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,399
want my application security cleaning

414
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,180
well this is the thing that

415
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,680
there is at least that would come to me  in mind to

416
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,440
do then maybe then not but this

417
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,380
generates problems the problems are

418
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,079
these that I as we said before q  This

419
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,579
stuff isn't static it's not that if I throw it

420
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,699
in once and it will stay that way

421
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,259
forever this infrastructure no these

422
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,420
services evolve every two weeks there is

423
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,699
a sprint

424
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,980


425
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,120


426
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,440
written

427
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,420
a security police that

428
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,399
stays there forever I will do the Find Tuning

429
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,500
I will make the changes I will try to make it

430
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,480
evolve No it's my job as a security

431
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,120
engineer Here then we come to the

432
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,980
problem of the consistency of the Policies

433
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,660
no So I bring my

434
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,160
micro services into production  and I put

435
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
my Policy in it but the next Release

436
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
I will put the new Policies But the micro

437
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,480
services that were already running That is, we

438
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,939
remember them the Policies of this micro

439
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,220
services become obsolete they become

440
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,040
obsolete as a result I have to go and

441
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,780
modify them I have to remember that I had

442
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,640
some micros  services that had

443
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,140
old Policies So if I didn't stop

444
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,460
them I didn't restart them with

445
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,140
the new ones  and Policy versions all

446
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,299
this stuff here is obsolete

447
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,640
and of course everything every

448
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,200
new service every new application that I

449
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,460
push into production I want it to have

450
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,900
the latest version of the

451
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,559
security policies Here's what we say makes

452
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,320
it clear that I can't put Policies inside

453
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,299
micro services  that is, the

454
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,539
security level cannot be embed inside the

455
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,340
microservice

456
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,880
And here the mesh enters the match what it is

457
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,860
basically In a nutshell for those who

458
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,539
don't know it Today I will

459
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,640
refer to risk that we say the

460
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,480
match excellence released Open Source

461
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,860
therefore also find the  source code

462
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,320
without major problems by now

463
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,539
probably the undisputed market leader

464
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,400


465
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
the mesh is nothing more than

466
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
an infrastructure that is under

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,280
cubernetis and that allows me to impose

468
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,500
security policies on cubernetis

469
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,059
above therefore it basically allows me

470
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,580
to decouple the

471
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,340
application layer on  which the

472
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
devops engineer normally works as

473
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,360
a control policy layer  on which I

474
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,460
want to work as Security therefore

475
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,840
it basically allows me to create a

476
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,720
control Plain

477
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,400
and there I put the security policies there

478
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,620
I put the monitoring policies

479
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,360
so Going back to our scenario the

480
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,780
Policies will no longer be inside the services I

481
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,539
uncouple the Policies I pull this

482
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,660
I pull this line below I leave the policies

483
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,120
And below there is the Mash service above there

484
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,620
are the applications that apply the

485
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,080
Policies that the Smash service tells me that

486
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,240
I have to apply nothing more than this

487
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,820
Service Smash inside has an engine

488
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,100
called Opa openpolis Agent which

489
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,520
basically  it does nothing but

490
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,600
enclose all these Policies and

491
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,520
evaluate that every time something

492
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,860
is brought into production So every

493
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,020
push I do everything that gets

494
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,820
pushed follows the security policies

495
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,000
otherwise it doesn't go into production

496
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,280
block says couberneties don't let

497
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,799
the pipeline go forward

498
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,100
Audit does the same if I already have

499
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,600
micro services in production I

500
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,700
run the s  Mash service and service

501
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,960
Mash has to check everything in

502
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,940
production to tell me everything is compliant

503
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,760
otherwise I either turn off the services or

504
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,039
do something in any case not good

505
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,880
I hope everything is clear enough up to here let's

506
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,100
go into

507
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,840
some use cases though  before going

508
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,500
into some use cases I'll leave you like

509
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,539
this This is a bit of the mantra that helps us

510
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,000
a bit to understand if we've all thought a

511
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,460
bit how to say the scenarios no

512
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,020
when we go to test at least one

513
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,960
table top of  security on my

514
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,419
infrastructure and on my application

515
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,799
Basically This is my goal I

516
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,580
want the service to be the right one

517
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,799
that has the right credentials So that

518
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,039
it has a Strong identity and

519
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,440
lastly especially if we work in Web

520
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,179
Applications or in any case in environments

521
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,240
where  services don't need to

522
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,980
work on behalf of themselves but i need to work on behalf

523
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,520
of the users i need to be sure the

524
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,260
service is working on behalf of the

525
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,660
correct user so this is a

526
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,480
bit  is summary of the last 20 minutes

527
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
or so

528
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,160
good case number 1 the right service

529
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,740
with the right credentials here I

530
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,280
designed a simple application

531
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,679
formed by a front end and a weekend

532
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,260
is a credit card application and

533
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,660
what I want

534
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,120
above will be the application  under the

535
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,919
Mascio service So what I want

536
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,140
They are two very simple trivial things No

537
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,980
from a security point of view

538
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,380
I first of all want the identities to

539
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,240
be strong

540
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,100
and therefore this as you can see I define it

541
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,200
below in the Service Mash So I want

542
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,539
this application to have

543
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,220
identical cryptographic So I want

544
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,299
that the CIA of the Mash

545
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,720
Service services a certificate and manages

546
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,059
the certificate the important thing is that

547
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,460
when you use the Mash service you on

548
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,640
the application side do not know anything about it,

549
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,320
that is, all this goes behind the scenes

550
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
under you do not have to touch the

551
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
applications and Service match  who

552
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,380
thinks about it So

553
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,640
I mean the Service Mash I want

554
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,240
this application  these two services

555
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
have cryptographic identities

556
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,799
I want them to do incruption in

557
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,120
transit So I want

558
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,940
the traffic to be centered when they talk to each other And

559
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,500
I want them to do

560
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,240
Strong authentication therefore based on those certificates

561
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,220
you gave me

562
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,440
first and last I also want to put a

563
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,559
more o  unless it tells me

564
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,720
that the only one who can talk to

565
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,860
the front end backn So I want to avoid

566
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,299
the backn being exposed to anything other

567
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,640
than the front end

568
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,440
mutually authenticated with an encrypted connection

569
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,179
how do I do this with 10 lines of

570
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,620
code more or less

571
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,059
So here I have a Policy istio a

572
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,980
Authentication Pira So this Polesine

573
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,000
written in the Service Mash

574
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,780
basically tells me any

575
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,179
connection inside this

576
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,840
cuberneties namespace of mine must be mtls

577
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,740
so TLS switches authentication in

578
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,419
strict mode so I don't want exceptions

579
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,520
to this rule  If someone tries

580
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,340
block it

581
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,659
second part authorization Policy

582
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,400
quin  give the authorization part then

583
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,340
in the backend namespace I want to

584
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,220
be connected

585
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,260
and authorizations to connections only

586
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,960
coming from the frontend Nain Space

587
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,960
with these methods So with these

588
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,360
ten lines of code

589
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,159
basically my Service Mash does nothing

590
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,440
but enforce  to my cubernetis Cluster to

591
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,760
follow these rules then the

592
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
encrypted traffic authenticated and only with the former

593
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
controllers that I want according to

594
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,860
youscase

595
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,419
the correct service with the

596
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,059
correct credentials on behalf of the correct user

597
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,039
so in this case I set a

598
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,080
scenario where I have a user  tries

599
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,400
to access my front end and I want to

600
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,059
give him the information that obviously

601
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,620
is during the weekend

602
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,140
So what happens

603
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,880
You don't see it so true

604
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,580
Oh well the things written in lighter green They

605
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,600
were the same as before

606
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,080
so I want mtls crypto and I want

607
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,299
the Strong credentials for the  identity

608
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,940
what you basically add

609
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,820
an ex Policy which tells me ok that front

610
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,020
Ends is author  ized to talk to the

611
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,159
back-end but you can't talk to it whenever

612
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,039
you want you have to talk to it only when

613
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,900
a user has arrived he

614
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,840
authenticated himself correctly he did everything on the

615
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
authentication flow and you detached the

616
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,700
correct JW tic token So he has to

617
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,679
present himself with a JW

618
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,600
and  to be correct it means it must

619
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,820
contain the correct claims so

620
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,860
at that point I can only give you the data that

621
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,799
corresponds to the claim contained in the WWE

622
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,600
token because it is Beer So

623
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,580
inside it contains all the claims how I

624
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,159
do it First of all I make a method

625
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,380
say this authentication So  I say

626
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,600
that any connection that arrives

627
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,220
at the gateway entrance must be

628
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,440
authenticated so no one shows up and

629
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,500
scolds me And I reply to him that it must

630
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,539
be authenticated using this

631
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,659
this vissure of which I pass him the

632
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,400
puzz

633
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,620
so in one step I did two things to

634
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,200
him  said everyone who arrives

635
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,659
must authenticate and they must

636
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,900
authenticate and I expect to end

637
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,059
up with a JW of tokens  which is

638
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,299
detached from this issure

639
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,580
then I go to the authorization police

640
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,059
instead so again

641
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,740
I can introduce myself as a front-end

642
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,179
I didn't put it here the rule is the

643
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,620
same as before but when I present myself

644
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,159
with the front-end I have to request the

645
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,980
prince that basically  there is

646
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,140
this jwty token so the backend

647
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,740
must expect this token Jade up

648
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,380
But that it has this value inside the claim

649
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,080
So I want that not only

650
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,360
the token JW is correct but that it

651
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,500
contains that specific value

652
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,679
inside that correct claim  in

653
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,480
this case that the user belongs to a

654
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,159
certain group so I know that that

655
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,419
group of those authorized to

656
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,640
access the information

657
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,559
So basically what happens It's

658
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,059
just in simple terms is that if I

659
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,400
make a curve towards the ingress gateway

660
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,340
of my Service  Mash

661
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,320
lerre Bach tells me the night because

662
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,720
obviously I didn't introduce myself I have an

663
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,940
authorization Policy that obliges me

664
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,799
if I take a bend and pass a Beer

665
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,039
t  oken at random I still get a denai

666
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,299
because the bircolo which must not be

667
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,600
detached from the one from the smoother ones if

668
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,159
I present myself with the direct which is

669
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,980
correct then I enter well the last case

670
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,900
is the one a little more Corner Cave which

671
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,520
is nice however So I want to protect myself  from an

672
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,820
Insider Strong le authenticated So I

673
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,140
did all my infrastructure but

674
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,659
what if I with the Bed Agent as

675
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,880
before I mean the attacker managed to

676
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,919
enter or the attacker is one of my

677
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,620
employees so same scenario as

678
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,320
before front Strong authentication all

679
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,940
that  what we said to each other in this case

680
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,520
I have an Insider

681
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,539
Insider of course I enter with a method

682
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,059
Zero trash So with a Zero trash

683
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,299
proxy or whatever he wants to do and What is

684
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,159
this user is a

685
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,980
support engineer the classic Insider

686
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,140
the support engineer for work  he has to access

687
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,400
the backend data because if it's a

688
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,559
support ticket he has to help me in

689
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,720
my users fine i what i want to happen

690
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,640
though i don't want that if only because

691
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,740
if  I'm a support user you can log in

692
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,059
to the back end and do whatever the hell you want to

693
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,679
access all the information you

694
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,440
want and

695
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,120
see all my confidential

696
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,919
credit card data No I want you

697
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,600
to engineer my weekend first

698
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
only through the front end  It's not that you

699
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,380
connect straight to the back-end just because

700
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,260
you're doing support but it's not that you connect

701
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,480
randomly and throw me two scripts I want that

702
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,940
when you connect to the front-end I want to

703
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,460
be sure you're switching from the

704
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,919
Case management tool because inside the

705
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,659
tools Management I put the

706
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,120
logic where you can access a case only

707
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,740
if your manager has assigned you that case

708
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,679
I have audit rules olax control or

709
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,539
all my rules my

710
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,740
so-called business policies implemented

711
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,440
So what I want to avoid is

712
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,080
this That is, that

713
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,640
the insider entry in a Strong way

714
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,120
authenticated all authorized but yes

715
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,740
in his spare time he decides to throw me

716
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,299
his beautiful scripts to access

717
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,640
backgammon outside all day  atabase how

718
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,799
i do it well usual rule

719
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,000
very similar to the one before actually

720
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,620
because in the end it is nothing more than

721
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,679
create here Ok basically create

722
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,020
a rule that allows me to access

723
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,539
the backend only from the frontend Plus i

724
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,059
have to simply add  a rule

725
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,980
that tells me that the jeda plus token

726
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,220
made by the T Exchange

727
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,200
we are not authenticating the user only

728
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,059
the user But if the tool is also authenticated

729
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,059
so basically I want that and

730
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,500
we see it below

731
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,440
the

732
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
token contain a claim that tells me that

733
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,700
the  'user is coming from the case tool

734
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,100
so he is connecting via the

735
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,559
case tool in this way I close the

736
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,940
circle

737
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,799
and nobody can connect directly

738
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
to the back-end he can connect to the

739
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,059
front-end but only if he arrives in a

740
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,179
federated way through these steps

741
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,000
fine  this is basically the

742
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,100
power one of the Mash service because

743
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,659
everything we've seen so far is

744
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,000
absolutely

745
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,679
application agnostic, i.e. I put some

746
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,659
security cards there  credit But you could have

747
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:13,919
done it with any type of application

748
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,419
no

749
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,700
the last step is to define the

750
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,980
rules of the game no that is I as a company

751
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,220
want to define the Boundaries within

752
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,320
which my users can work

753
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,360
because otherwise the Security team wo

754
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,279
n't scale there again  is the

755
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,080
security team must define the rules of the

756
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,000
game you can audit these rules

757
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,380
of the game verify that

758
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,840
these rules are actually kept

759
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,940
implemented but cannot go into the

760
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,799
merits and this is done thanks

761
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,799
to enforcement the enforcement is done with

762
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,220
a tool that is gatekeeper

763
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,600
basically it is an extension of Opa

764
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,279
which is the Policy engine that I

765
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,100
mentioned before which allows you to verify

766
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,720
that all the objects that are

767
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,580
entering from my Cluster are

768
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,159
compliant with a Policy So

769
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,679
what happens is simple ubernets receives

770
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,059
a request or Cube CTL from  pipe Dunno

771
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,039
I receive a request

772
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,899
What it does create a Mission request the

773
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,360
passgate

774
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,679
does nothing but take this

775
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,419
object that is trying to enter

776
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,380
my Cluster goes to Opa Verify Policies

777
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,760
and tells me this object enters the

778
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,220
Cluster or does not enter the cluster

779
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,320
as it does thanks to its template consoles

780
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,059


781
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:34,440
which is the method

782
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,559
gateaper works with they are nothing else  that the

783
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,940
CRDs at the end with bernetti then some

784
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,700
extension so in

785
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,919
this example I basically create a

786
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,279
template that tells me if an

787
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,580
object arrives which can also be a new

788
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,740
Policy for my Service Smash

789
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,740
which is trying to do TLS disable

790
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,760
then TLS Mod  disable

791
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
is a violation Violeta so

792
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,340
reject it in this way I have created

793
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,620
a polis an enforcement of a Policy

794
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,799
that tells me whoever comes to

795
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,140
you cubernets Even if with the

796
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,299
correct semantics even if authenticated even if

797
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,580
authorized If he tries to push in

798
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,039
something that is not TLS  Kick him out

799
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,779
and this is the example of the Policy Then

800
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,820
someone comes Try to kick me in

801
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,399
a network Policy of istio with a

802
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,500
PlayStation rules c  he tells me that the

803
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,559
connection within the different

804
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,440
namespace to the TLS disable

805
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,799
passes gubernatis ladnation request

806
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,500
gateaper refused done don't join the

807
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,740
cluster

808
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,799
All this has taught us a few

809
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,919
things no has taught us that I can't

810
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,059
think of

811
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,960
admitting anything in the  my Cluster

812
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,640
because otherwise the lateral movements

813
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,100
are too trivial and But I ca

814
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,799
n't even as a Security engineer be able to

815
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,880
enter my

816
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,279
applications to be able to fix

817
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,320
it I can't do it That is, we don't have

818
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,720
the strength we are not enough no So

819
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,940
what I have to  to do is create

820
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,340
Boundaries create the rules of the game and

821
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,260
take advantage of the technology that I have

822
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,460
available to create these rules

823
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,740
of the game but we must always

824
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,679
remember that Ok create the rules of the

825
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,760
game So zero Trust don't trust

826
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,279
anything but always check always

827
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,779
check because for  how

828
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,659
well technology is done

829
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:38,100
everything doesn't always go as it should no So

830
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,320
even if I have my rule  by Cake for

831
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,419
this we have seen before

832
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,480
There are reice conditions There

833
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,100
are situations and for which maybe

834
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,200
something in my Cluster or maybe because

835
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,460
I haven't written my Policy

836
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,399
perfectly but maybe something enters

837
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,960
my Cluster therefore tools like

838
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,600
gatekeepers tools like  istio the

839
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,100
same cubernetsk with its modules

840
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,140
have all their diode functions

841
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,820
So what I invite you to do is

842
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,700
zero Trust So let's implement all the

843
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,299
rules of the game but always check the

844
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,240
summary I finished even a few

845
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,880
minutes early

846
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,659
on the piece well my San  Marino

847
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,760
Thanks this because I finished

848
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,279
early No my Summer is very

849
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,659
simple

850
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,700
nothing trusted

851
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,159
not Ok let's continue to use the drugs for

852
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,039
sure let's do everything

853
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,799
possible to make the firewall work at its

854
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,320
best we also do packet

855
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,159
inspection giant IPS I want you as

856
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,080
big as possible these firewalls  but then

857
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,019
when we're inside don't trust it don't

858
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,000
trust it because it's really  the worst things

859
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,980
happen to you when something

860
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,039
bad is inside let's

861
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,260
decouple the Policies from the application

862
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,539
Ok okay let's

863
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,200
write this application well

864
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
because we have seen the sisd cycle

865
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,100
before there is a whole part before

866
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,299
putting it into production that must be

867
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,380
done well  with security testing

868
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,199
code composition static

869
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,418
analysis there's a lot of

870
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,800
cool Tulls out there that we didn't

871
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,418
talk about today

872
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,940
but try to do this decoupling when you're in

873
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,719
production

874
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,320
Remember the mantra

875
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,480
and remember that enforcement is the

876
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,820
part  who is your friend don't write

877
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,440
a Policy without enforcing it

878
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,359
because then later when I get to the

879
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,679
developer who is in a hurry he

880
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,199
pushes it and you don't notice it you

881
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,520
notice it when in production when in

882
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,760
production it's late but it's late but not

883
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,159
late enough  to do the checks

884
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,150
ok finished Thanks to all

885
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,370
[Applause]

886
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,280
[Music]

887
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,760
[Applause]
