1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,860
So then while Raffaele is getting ready

2

I wanted to tell you that they are shooting they are about

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,859
to shoot I

4
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,380
don't see them but somewhere there they are

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,740
Here they are our valets

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,039
collecting for A smile is not enough

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,560
so when you take out

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,200
your beautiful wallets any offer

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,620
from  5 cents to 50 million euro It's

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,160
appreciated now we have the great Raffaele

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,700
with the old lady who talks to us about anti

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,579
Fishing and beyond therefore beyond we go

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,460
beyond the protection of the brand and the

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,739
mail domain Thanks Raffaele we are

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,079
really Oh our last Talk then

16
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,539
we have the  final round table 20

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,420
minutes to 15 20 minutes in all Thank you

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,539
nice the beauty of being the last is that

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,159
there is a lot of beer

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,619
and then

21
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:08,720
off

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,540
Here I am my name is Raffaele I should

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,600
put on a hood to be a

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,460
hacker because I don't do it for

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,299
a living  So I'm a person who

26
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,820
migrates companies to Microsoft 365 things

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,759
you don't know and a really bad very

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,860
good person I just came

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,960
to the den of  Leoni but today

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm talking about a protocol called

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,200
dimark and I didn't put it in the title

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,880
because the last time I put it in the

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,579
title they rejected my tolc because

34
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,100
we can't talk about acronyms So I

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,220
'll tell you about How to protect  your

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,700
brand and how to secure your

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,240
email domain I claim the right to

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,540
tell you that it will be one of the few Talks that

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,340
you will go home and say Wait, I'll

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,460
check because in my opinion this could

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,399
also be my problem

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,200
So what are we going to see we're going to

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,179
see Oh well Fishing via email is a

44
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,038
quick slide we're going to see what

45
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,280
this protocol is it's not a product it's

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,459
a protocol we just need to implement it

47
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,959
we're going to see an icing on the

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
cake that we will like the questions and

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
answers are the last so they will

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
translate to  so

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
you can tell me we will go and see some

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
real cases

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,700
well well well you know very well this

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,840
percentage is decreasing because it is

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,540
decreasing because the dmark is coming into

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,420
play for  let's say

57
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,300
that malware threats enter the network

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,760
Going through e-mail

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,540
75% of the time and they are all vulnerable

60
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,319
from the CEO to the

61
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,500
last worker it

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,580
is possible to deceive through e-mail

63
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,580
basically in three ways

64
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,860
I change the display name So I go to

65
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,319
Google  it creates a mailbox for me and then I put

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,819
the name of your managing director and

67
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,040
I'll send you an email. If you don't see

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
the email address, you'll fall for it, but by

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,360
now everyone can see the email address,

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,200
or I can buy a

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,080
slightly different email domain where

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,659
the  the last letter of PayPal is actually

73
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,599
a capital i or I put a number in it

74
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,959
and I can cheat you in these first two

75
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,720
cases in principle the

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,480
anti-spam systems understand that a domain similar

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,640
to a domain you talk to and

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,260
therefore help you

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,299
But it exists  also another type of

80
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,420
spoofing is spoofing where

81
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,959
the right mail domain

82
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,840
is used, i.e. the name and surname of the

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,180
CEO of your supplier-client company is used

84
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,299
which t  i writes and asks you to change the

85
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,400
IBAN

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,860
eh But how is it possible eh how is it possible it

87
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,959
is possible because the domain of the

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,780
writer is not protected by this

89
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,260
protocol

90
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,238
all of you in here

91
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,180
surely

92
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,520
know the spf everyone knows the spf because  it's been around for a very

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,800
long time some have known the

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,540
dickim

95
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,699
And we're used to hearing

96
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,560
about the insurance that the

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
banks tell you today so I'll get you

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,620
the insurance I'll make you pay less

99
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,479
if you implement the di chime E spf no it's

100
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,520


101
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:48,020
not enough the dickim is not enough  whose spf is not enough

102
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
if you understood This you understood

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,460
everything

104
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,479
above there is the dmark that completes and

105
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,120
we will see it shortly Then there is the bimi and the

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,639
icing on the cake

107
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,060
it is not needed now all these are not

108
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,820
products they are protocols

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,979
so you have  the duty to go home

110
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,880
and document yourself because they are not paid

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,120
Ok Good

112
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,580
what is spf you need to do a minimum of a

113
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,139
minute then spf is a DNS record

114
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,020
that you publish in the DNS zone So

115
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,720
go tell the world that  the emails with

116
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,300
your domain come out of these

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,600
IP addresses and you list them at this

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,340
point

119
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,860
you send an email a recipient arrives

120
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,860
the recipient Looks in the DNS it says good

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,080
the IP address from which the email comes is the

122
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,139
one published by the sender Yes good

123
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,740
The email is good  if not it's fake

124
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,560
It's good I knew I'm implementing it no

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,419
problem

126
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,580
keep it aside

127
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,639
what is the Dick in

128
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,520
the dickim is a bit like the email signature

129
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
was implemented to meet

130
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,880
the requirement of the fact that the

131
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,520
SMTP protocol for  sending the emails is not

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
authenticated and encrypted and therefore you want to

133
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,560
at least see if someone along the

134
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,479
way has modified the content of the

135
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,080
email and therefore the dikim is a

136
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,220
digital signature of the email not all of it

137
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,560
matters little So what do I do I take the

138
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,180
private key The  I put it on my mail

139
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,699
server I get the public key

140
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,479
I put it on the DNS I send the signed mails and the

141
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,560
receiving server what it does it goes to the DNS it

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,860
reads the public key it uses it to

143
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,319
verify the signature of the mail and says

144
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,440
this mail

145
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,699
beware this mail has not been

146
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,419
modified along the way Ok if it has not

147
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,800
been modified the mail is good

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,520
otherwise it has been modified

149
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,220
Here is an example

150
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,240
of a mail and how come the world is made up

151
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,580
of 90 percent mails which are

152
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,740
crap

153
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,440
because the smtp protocol  it was

154
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,199
thought of many years ago

155
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,940
and is divided into two parts when

156
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,500
an email is sent It is divided into two

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,660
parts first there is the envelope part

158
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,360
where the server Yes declares and says Hello

159
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,300
I am this I would like to send you an email

160
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,639
from this address to this  other

161
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,020
address Ok

162
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,979
the mail from is fine the sender address is

163
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,220
the address on which the spf check will be carried

164
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,180
out ok

165
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,680


166
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,380
But then there is the body

167
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,380
and in the body one can put a

168
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:07,159
from address other than the mail from

169
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,620
eh mia I've always done this

170
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,800
I thought the spf record was enough, that's all the problem is

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,060
because when you send an email but if

172
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,759
it's good the mail from is equivalent to the

173
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,139
domain of the from and therefore there's no

174
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,419
problem but if you haven't implemented the

175
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,779
dmark the  your domain can be

176
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,779
impersonated

177
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,219
After that the unfortunate

178
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,140
recipient domain He has nothing to do with it

179
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,660
He just received the email he

180
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,800
will receive a nice email saying I'll

181
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,260
change your IBAN then they were also good

182
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,680
they made Kim's signature and so

183
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,120
everything is fine

184
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,339
But  the signature of whoever was designed

185
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,279
to guarantee the non-

186
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,160
reclamability of the mail in transit That is, you receive

187
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
the mail has not been modified but

188
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,320
a signature from Kim of

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,959
any domain can be applied because the

190
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,480
public key to verify it is said

191
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,060
inside leather it is like  say the

192
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,060
victim Sorry the attacker

193
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,220
certifies that this attack email

194
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,459
has not been modified or thanks Well well

195
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,300
thanks So Kim's can have

196
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,860
any domain so much so that generally

197
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,700
all Google Microsoft Aruba providers

198
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,279
sign their emails by Kim Ma  they

199
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,700
sign them with their domain they

200
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,620
don't sign them with yours because they don't

201
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
have access to your DNS for

202
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,319
keys we'll see later

203
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,019
there's some interest B  eh let's

204
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,760
see how we solve it so

205
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,740
we can live in uncertainty we may

206
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,140
not have control over who uses

207
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,519
our mail domain because the

208
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,399
problem here is not so much for us

209
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,279
I'm not here to tell you

210
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,720
protect yourself from those who attack you with

211
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,540
your domain because

212
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,580
the dumbest antispan in the world knows that if

213
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,080
an email from your domain arrives from

214
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,320
outside and arrives outside What do you want here the

215
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,019
problem is who uses your domain to

216
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,240
attack your friends, your

217
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,480
customers and your suppliers so

218
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
you have control over who  use

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,779
your domain or you are impersonable

220
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,220
and above all an email arrives to someone

221
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,279
with your mail domain but your

222
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,640
domain is or is not a company asset

223
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
now if your name is medrimaker.it

224
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,880
there are those who care but if you are a

225
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,220
big  company or are you an armed force

226
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm present here a wink at the dmark

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,660
after this presentation I'd give it

228
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,140
to him because with the dmark you will have control of

229
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,200
your domain your emails will be

230
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,720
rejected  pay attention to the fake ones,

231
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,700
not yours Excuse the ones that others

232
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,940
send in your name and therefore we could

233
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,279
say that your mail domain is

234
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,440
now authenticated This is a bit of a

235
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,260
stretch but I'll throw it there

236
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,060
so

237
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,220
therefore

238
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,860
here comes the very important concept

239
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,100
of alignment

240
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,760
when the domain of the from So

241
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,880
what the user sees in the email which is the

242
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,339
from the one in the body

243
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,279
when that domain is different from

244
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
the spf domain or Kim's domain it

245
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,620
means that it is not aligned

246
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,740
the marketing protocol will guarantee you

247
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,399
this alignment will guarantee you

248
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,140
things will happen when it is not

249
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,240
aligned

250
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,019
what is beautiful is that you will be able to

251
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,800
say my email domain is safe and

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
therefore if you receive an email where the

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,620
spf domain is not aligned with the

254
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,779
from domain you can throw it away so give

255
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,300
instructions to the other

256
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,240
to reject the email

257
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,660
the coolest thing in the world

258
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,480
and that there is the possibility to be

259
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,180
notified when someone uses your

260
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,140
domain to attack others that

261
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,000
's all

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,480
because you see your antispam You

263
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,440
see who is attacking you But none of us

264
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,420
is able to know if our

265
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,000
email domain is being used to

266
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
attack others

267
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,339
it's a social issue It's not a

268
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,040
matter of IT security

269
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
and here I have to say it  tired of

270
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,639
defending large companies where their

271
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,399
mail domain without dimark I

272
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,980
just have to prove that the mail with their

273
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,839
mail domain did not leave their

274
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,420
mail server it is good if you

275
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,360
implemented the dmark that mail in

276
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,899
Google or Microsoft systems did not enter

277
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,500
it is very important and above all you get

278
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,380
to know who uses your domain to

279
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,740
attack

280
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,779


281
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,060
privacy forensic issues we are talking about Dominick

282
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,760
not Mailboxes the name of the

283
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,380
mailbox So the part before

284
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,120
the snail will never appear

285
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,339
so everything GPR everything compliant place

286
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,079
maximum protection  beautiful

287
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,700
implemented by all major

288
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,620
e-mail providers

289
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,600
antispam services all

290
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,060
good

291
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,560
What does it mean to protect i  Your own

292
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,839
Brand I won't go into the merits of the

293
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,220
protocol because those things go

294
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,399
on the internet it's not a problem but

295
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,980
you can give indications of what to

296
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,100
do to your interlocutors with an

297
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,860
email that is not good So first of

298
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,440
all, leave, set the Policy to None

299
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,899
That is

300
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,000
already  nice that you know that there is set to

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,459
None and so we start from here i.e.

302
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,860
nothing changes no data indications to

303
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
throw yourself at nothing just go to

304
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,240
monitoring

305
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,860
collect the data see the reports

306
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,600
that arrive and perhaps discover that

307
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,160
someone uses your domain in

308
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,860
fraudulently or otherwise we will see later

309
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,839
After that you will go to quarantine then

310
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,779
in the end you will put everything to Reject

311
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,779
when you have the dmark with the Policy

312
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,920
rject you can rest assured that the

313
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,160
fake emails sent with your domain They

314
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,680
will never be delivered to the major

315
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,560
providers on the planet

316
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,160
and this is to protect  your Brand

317
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,660
so let's recap using the example

318
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,240
So here we have many people who

319
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,459
ship Eh why the big problem

320
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,240
what breath is it not just someone uses my

321
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,459
domain to attack outsiders But

322
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,459
what do you know that marketing hasn't

323
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,980
opened a subscription with Send Grid

324
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,560
to make a Massive campaign what do

325
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,360
you know that the administration doesn't use

326
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,399
salesforce to notify customers

327
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
suppliers therefore  the Shadow VT seen as

328
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,180
someone manages to do things without

329
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,880
calling the IT also exists in the world

330
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,339
of mail therefore within those who

331
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,800
send mail with your domain there

332
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,199


333
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,639
is you there is the business that does things without

334
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,920
telling us and then there  they are also the

335
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,959
attackers

336
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,420
And who is it that receives this email this

337
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,899
email sometimes us but above all others

338
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,120
those others are above

339
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
all on known mail systems all

340
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,880
the good thing is that how do you know that

341
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,920
someone uses your mail domain

342
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,800
to attack others because  whoever

343
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,240
receives the email sends you a notice

344
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,300
so there is a standard always in the dmark

345
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,360
the report is done in XML and

346
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,220
a mail address you name is sent

347
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,399


348
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,120
and therefore the  your Brand is protected by

349
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,779
looking at the reports that others send you

350
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,959


351
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,639
Ok it is not said that it is you who are

352
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,579
attacked On the contrary, it is above all the

353
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,699
others

354
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,040
therefore the reporting That is, it is not enough to

355
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,320
put

356
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,680
the dmark on you must also look at these

357
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,420
Reports

358
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,719
ok

359
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,719
now

360
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,759
about reporting sites because the  emails

361
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,800
arrive Sorry for the reports an

362
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,480
email arrives telling you that it can be in

363
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,839
your domain or not it doesn't matter it

364
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,439
is difficult to read an XML file that

365
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,919
arrives by email what do you do i.e. we are

366
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
talking about large companies that receive

367
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,179
hundreds of reports a day what do you do

368
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,040
you read them all you see the IP addresses

369
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,740
so There are sites that do

370
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,520
reporting there are from craus to

371
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,439
very expensive

372
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,020
And what they give you an indication Look at

373
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,740
this day you had a peak That

374
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,480
means your domain was

375
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,880
used to attack others  and

376
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,900
you have it So for the first time There is

377
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,100
a protocol that tells you who is using

378
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,299
your domain to attack others

379
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,360
and you can know it  re only if you

380
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,059
implement branded reporting the one you

381
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,780
want There are a lot of them

382
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,120
The still nice thing is

383
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,880
for example my company uses Google it

384
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,440
sends

385
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,080
2,430 mails per month well and if

386
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,960
the administration put sangrid and if

387
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,660
you are the Force it was implemented

388
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,179
by  'other and if the system administrator has his

389
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,919
own alert server that sends the

390
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,539
alerts out

391
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,059
then with the reporting you can

392
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,059
also know the sending sources

393
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,280
of your domain

394
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,200
the good ones you will put in place with

395
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,340
Kim's sp.fl the

396
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,760
ones that are not  good you

397
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,860
will set the Policy to Reject and those

398
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,520
mails will not be delivered they

399
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,379
will stop attacking now

400
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,880
take note of what this stuff is Well

401
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,240
Look at a DNS record of type txt

402
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,559
underscore dmark dot underscore

403
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,539
Sorry dot your mail domain

404
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,960
good Now you will go home you will do  an

405
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,360
nslook

406
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,280
or you'll go to MX Turbo In short,

407
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
anyone So if you don't have it,

408
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,160
you only have an excuse until tonight you

409
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,179
simply didn't know it So

410
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,860
you are de  the ignorant i.e. I was

411
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,059
unaware of the existence of the dmark or you will

412
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,419
see branded p9 that's

413
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,940
enough What is Pinone for

414
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,280
i.e. yes You know it exists you put the

415
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,760
pianone Eh but then it doesn't collect the reports

416
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,799
you don't get your harmful emails rejected

417
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,740
Yes you only know that it exists or have you  put

418
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,020
an email from your domain thinking you

419
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,059
have time to go and look at

420
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,179
all the XML reports that arrive to you as

421
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,360
if from an IP in Burundi you know if

422
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,860
that email is good Sure if it's from

423
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,679
Burundi But those of Sales or sangrid are

424
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,419
not there  do you know

425
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,059
or are you someone who is working so

426
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,120
do you have any reporting site

427
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,760
here I don't care which one and

428
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,539
maybe you also have the Pia None because

429
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,700
you need to have a plan to start

430
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,799
working because you can't put the p at

431
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,559
40 years or Reject without having the

432
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,799
certainty of having put all

433
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,100
the sources of true shipments in order So are you

434
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,200
working

435
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,780
or are you small and this is

436
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,419
because I too had started like this

437
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,640
Ohi I only send emails from Google

438
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,400
Wor  ld Space Office 365 I put their

439
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,059
group of P Bona P Reject it's my end I do

440
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,700
n't give a damn to see who uses

441
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,960
my domain to attack because

442
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,500
I know that correct mails will be

443
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,400
rejected But if you're wise and if you're a

444
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,700
large company  not only do you keep the project

445
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,179
but you continue to monitor because knowing

446
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,059
when attackers do

447
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:11,120
Fishing campaigns on your behalf is very useful

448
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,600
here right what happened a big

449
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,919
company we are talking about

450
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,260
big companies start monitoring 4

451
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,600
million report objects arriving at

452
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,059
month with binone see how many Rossi

453
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,640
These are all attacks be careful

454
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,460
the attack when you put Spinone it's not necessarily

455
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,820
malicious Eh maybe it's a

456
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,559
source of your own shipping that you

457
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
didn't know existed because it was

458
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,659
created by someone and therefore you have to

459
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,700
try to contact him and put it

460
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,659
ok When and then everything ok Reject

461
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,640
the use collapses i.e. the

462
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,080
attackers stop using your

463
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,940
domain to attack

464
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,840
the icing  on the cake is I make a

465
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,860
bunch so I put the by marcareject

466
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,320
How nice that two years ago

467
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,240
a protocol was not standardized to make

468
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,659
my logo appear in the mail boxes

469
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,940


470
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,039
beautiful destination my corporate place so

471
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,400
if you already have if you are big and it is an

472
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,280
important Brand  and you have already registered

473
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,220
the international brand this brand

474
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,320
can be put

475
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,140
in your mails for delivery

476
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,880
the delivery provider will take care of making it

477
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,440
look

478
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,780
nice everything nice Microsoft doesn't

479
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,100
care

480
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,280
but I'm working on it I'm here for

481
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,880
this too ok this is also a standard

482
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,760
DNS Then oh well you can

483
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,559
go and look at the questions shortly

484
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,900
then

485
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,500
hop So let's look at

486
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,299
four quick examples eh so we understand it

487
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,179
immediately so in this case it is a

488
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,400
Classic case of attack Generally

489
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,260
attackers take the domains and

490
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,000
snoop senders  malware that starts

491
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,480
sending mails around and in this case the

492
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,220
mail comes from this IP address in the

493
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,740
name of Net search.org  so the

494
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,679
spf domain is this I'm going to see

495
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,880
the email editor the

496
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,500
authentication results line

497
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,799
All mail providers have this How to see

498
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,500
the email editor quite simple

499
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,120
search on google do you have Thunderbird

500
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,340
Thunderbird is from  remale and find out

501
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,140
there is a lot of interesting information

502
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,980
this email therefore comes from these Ps it is

503
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,039
in soft Fail this here is the SP

504
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,860
PDF record with Tilde all

505
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,260
and now we could talk about it for another few

506
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,200
hours but Netflix put in some of

507
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,320
its  but it doesn't have Kim's signature Then at

508
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,299
a certain point an email arrives in the name of the

509
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,400
collection agency That is, or

510
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,000
collection agency That is, not a Pizza

511
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,340
Fichi domain eh

512
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,240
So this is who receives it the from

513
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,580
collection agency but the Return Path

514
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,400
therefore the spf check is  been done on

515
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,240
Net Search

516
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,700
But you have a collection agency let's go

517
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,000
see the dmark the dmark doesn't exist and

518
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,659
therefore the action and it's not this email

519
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,580
enter now Then there are the

520
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,460
antispam checks there is the magician Eh that  but in the

521
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,520
meantime she has entered In the meantime she has entered

522
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,100
ok

523
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,980
This instead is a very nice case

524
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,419
sangrid provider of massive invs

525
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,240
Probably someone over time had created

526
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,520
a mail.com account which

527
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,380
they probably forced so

528
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,440
look at the mail it starts from senggrid in the

529
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,900
name mail.com

530
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,659
but it starts from  sangrid so the spf is

531
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,179
fine because you see

532
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,340
sangrid sangrid but the from

533
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,400
sandried the spf is fine the dikim is fine

534
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,620
because the [ __ ] guarantees you that the

535
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,539
mail starts from sengry and arrives at its

536
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,000
destination without modifications

537
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,179
fine Then at a certain point  the dmark

538
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,840
fails Why Because

539
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,100
mail put the dmark but the action is

540
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,120
None

541
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,919
so the mail enters

542
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,020


543
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,419
anyway because you remember it's not enough to have the dmark But you also need to have the Policy to

544
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,100
Reject or quarantine

545
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,940
another domain recently ok

546
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,299
here the dmark  the mail fails from a

547
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,580
cassa

548
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,620
depositimar fails action no the mail

549
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,179
enters

550
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,559
Ok so here it is right i.e. here you are

551
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,380
not the attacker you did not even try

552
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,600
to impersonate another domain  nio for

553
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,480
the spf Ok In the sense that both having the

554
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,700
not having the dmark

555
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,240
if the recipient cannot do that

556
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,520
check the fpf fails So this

557
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,380
email has ended up in quarantine

558
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,380
regardless But in the meantime it has entered

559
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,440
so let's go and see the last case of

560
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,340
this domain  it has the dmark and celareject

561
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,120
so

562
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,700
British pains.com was probably

563
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,640
a server that was hacked so they

564
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,880
send emails with spf verified

565
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,340
Because they come out of that email domain they

566
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,279
don't bother signing

567
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,460
chim nobody cares anyway but  the

568
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,279
dmark fails because this

569
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,640
mail domain has the dimarcareject at that point

570
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,159
you see the action that

571
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,400
the server that receives This mail is

572
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,220
then there is not written Reject is called

573
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,580
or that is, the tag probably says Oh R there is

574
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,500
ct  probably that's why I don't know

575
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,799
but this is the fact this email does not

576
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,220
enter and you see that therefore it is the

577
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,659
perfect case this email is blocked

578
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,380
to finish

579
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,320
or this because we all and

580
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,059
each of us use the email  we have its own email domain Take

581
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,220
a look at the

582
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,740
tmark put it in Reject it's good for everyone

583
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,980
if you're small implement the dmark It's

584
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,100
quite easy because if it's your

585
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,980
domain you know it comes from Google from

586
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,820
Microsoft and from your mail server

587
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,820
take the  'IP put spf in place because

588
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,000
the dmark I remind you it checks

589
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,279
positive if

590
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,240
the spf is fine or the Dick is fine on the

591
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,539
same mail domain from So if

592
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,400
you're small it's easy Eh if you're

593
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,840
big no

594
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,960
don't Reject a mail domain

595
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,400
big because

596
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,960
marketing administration billing

597
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,880
production notifications

598
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,980
firewall e-mail alerts stop

599
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,279


600
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,740
arriving finally your antivirus and antispam

601
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,980
protects you

602
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,200
but does not protect the use of your domain

603
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,380
towards customers and suppliers

604
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,200
and finally  all if you have

605
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
mailboxes in big providers like

606
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,720
Google or Microsoft

607
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,940
and it's not implemented by default so

608
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,539
look at it ok

609
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,200
finished

610
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:52,869
