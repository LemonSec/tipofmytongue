1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,380
we should be there You're welcome Thank you Barbara

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,980
Good afternoon everyone I'm

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,660
honored and

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,800
excited to be here today with you

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,939
all

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,340
Why do

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,500
we always say the phrase let's network

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,380
So I say to myself today it's time to

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,120
really do it

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,300
for those who deal with

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,040
digital issues of digital

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,480
training young

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,040
institutions  Today we really have

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,719
the opportunity to

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,940
talk about many things with this topic, I think it concerns

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,500
each of us, among other things, we

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,660
really have a Parterre that I want to

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
introduce to you.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,860


20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,840


21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,239
I have already told you today's theme

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,940
is bullying cyberbullying in

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,319
particular we will try to understand a

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,360
little more and we have as guests

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,159
Dr. Alessandra Berardini

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
cosca manager Now she will explain to you

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,119
what the

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:12,979


29
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,020
Emilia Romagna cyber security operations center is and  Marche

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,659
then we have Major Alessio

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,880
perloca Marshal Pasquale Roberto Scimenes

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
Carabinieri and representation of the

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,159
provincial command of Bologna and we will see In short,

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,799
they will tell us many things Then we have

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
Claudio Canavese of zanching and we will

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,060
also talk about digital martial arts and then

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,439
Fabio De Nunzio and Maurizio Siracusa

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,159
who represent bullying No thanks

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,140
So let's talk about a current topic

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,299
Let's talk  of a thorny topic

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,060
We talk about a topic I say

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,860
by doing mainly The lawyer

43
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,220
I realize Then when it's too late

44
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,680
and something has happened Instead today it's

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,240
important to talk about

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,640


47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,899
prevention activities training and

48
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,660
awareness activities because

49
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,420
the tools we use and  of

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,580
which In short, of which we are talking about even

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,959
these days

52
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,819
we know that they are a great resource, a

53
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,680
great wealth but they can also be

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,260
a very serious danger for

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,879
our kids too.

56
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,120


57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920


58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,379


59
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,080
victims too

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,459
we a  our times are now more

61
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,640
pervasive and more important to understand them and

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,160
understand how to counter them So I would

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,580
immediately give the floor And I would leave I would

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,920
immediately say to the police forces to

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,500
understand the great activity they do

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,599
So I would give

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,300
Dr. Alessandra Belardini the  In the

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,519
meantime, he will tell us what the cost is, so I

69
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,519
'll take it too today what the postal police do on the

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,140
territory in these matters

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,239


72
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,260
and so let's say I would say

73
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,879
an introduction to the doctor thanks

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,800
thanks

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,720
Good evening Thanks for this invitation because it

76
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
is fundamental in a concept of

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,519
proximity to make people understand how much the state police are

78
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,980
in general life and

79
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,659
above all how much the

80
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,120
postal communications police commit themselves every day

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
to almost chilling topics,

82
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,060
sometimes such as the matter

83
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,500
of cyberbullying So what does

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,739
kosque mean It is a term without the ending things

85
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,099
that  basta It is a new deadline from 21

86
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,200
October all postal police departments

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
of communications ch  and there are 20 of them

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,159
in each regional capital

89
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,400
they have changed their name i.e. they are

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,739
called Coast operational centers for

91
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,159
cyber security we are 20 and yet

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
we are also in every province here in

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
Emilia Romagna we have a Bologna cosca

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,220
and we have soscs located throughout the

95
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,080
regional territory  sosche are the

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,220
operational sections for cyber security

97
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,980
basically the

98
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,860
postal police so let's also try to

99
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,720
take stock of what it does Because

100
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,220
many ask me But the postal

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,080
police and police So we are absolutely

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,040
police we are a State Police with

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,380
a know-how  how that is

104
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,839
precisely that of dealing with the

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,360
criminal cases that are carried out

106
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,639
exclusively mainly with the use

107
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,800
of IT tools I

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
also say laughing that a murder that is

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,940
perpetrated with a cell phone because I

110
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,380
take a cell phone I will smash

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,060
a person in the head  Obviously it is not the

112
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,400
responsibility of the Postal Police

113
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,199
because we  in reality we deal with 5

114
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,840
sectors the first sector which is a

115
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,720
wide-ranging and

116
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,100
extremely expanding sector Which is that

117
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,220
of critical infrastructures i.e. on the

118
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,979
territory a company that is public

119
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,180
private A

120
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,500
productivity nucleus which holds the

121
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,540
sensitive data because today the

122
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,280
criminal associations work a lot on sensitive data,

123
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,139
i.e. on the concept of

124
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,560
information for us it is an objective to be

125
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,479
protected And how we protect it we

126
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,280
protect it in a preventive and

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,520
repressive manner through

128
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,979
a whole series of

129
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,360
operational connections between us and

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,340
the critical infrastructure concerning

131
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,259
the exchange of  information that is

132
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,300
important through the concept

133
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
of alert what is the Alert the alert

134
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,000
is nothing more than the notice made in

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,100
short terms and above all with a

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,039
technical nature in which we who are in the

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,660
area notify the

138
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,820
corresponding critical infrastructure that in  that

139
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
period unfortunately it can happen that

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,440
a certain type of act has been perpetrated

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
acco infrastructures that are similar

142
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,460
but not in Italy in the world because

143
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,500
we say that the structure of the

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,840
Postal Police is a circular structure and

145
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,780
therefore we dialogue with the chennaipic

146
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,639
I know these are difficult words but in

147
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,960
reality they are not there is the

148
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,180
national center for  protection of the

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,500
critical infrastructures located in

150
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,840
Rome, the chenaipik with a

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,120
view to teaming up with the

152
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,000
other non-national or

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,520
international but transnational cleaners

154
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,460
obviously receives that very

155
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,780
important information which

156
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,520
means what type of attack at that

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
moment can unfortunately be probable

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,419
that it also happens in our territory

159
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,520
and therefore we exchange information

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
therefore critical infrastructures second

161
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,060
field which unfortunately this too is very

162
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,759
delicate in which however the postal police

163
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,860
has an exclusive competence is that

164
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,440
of online child pornography that is

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
everything concerning the production the

166
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
disclosure  exploitation

167
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,419
of child pornography images sop  all

168
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,720
as regards a perspective of

169
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,940
repression and therefore of research on the web,

170
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,220
in this case in the Dark Web of

171
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
what can be precisely

172
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,479
criminal associations that sell and trade

173
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,340
child pornography products. Here we

174
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,800
deal with this. I am very keen to

175
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,680
make this clarification, many  they think

176
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,740
that the Postal Police hunt for

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,740
pedophiles yes we do that too but it is

178
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,960
also good to understand that we are in 2022

179
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,800
almost 2023 and today the

180
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,300
child pornography product is a product I know I am

181
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,580
saying something absurd but I assure you it

182
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,520
is real it is a commercial product That is

183
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,860
today a child pornography product is no longer packaged

184
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,280
online for

185
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,319
exclusive and personal use only but there are

186
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,460
criminal associations that sell

187
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,440
child pornography products for the purpose

188
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
of money laundering So it is

189
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,860
a particularly invasive activity

190
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,880
particularly technical and

191
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,979
particularly technical cannot

192
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,360
do all Obviously this work

193
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,560
because you must have d  n the

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,300
particular characteristics that are

195
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,660
tested every six months, it is clear that an

196
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,400
undercover Postal Police agent

197
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,740
who sees

198
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,900
very

199
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,220
invasive and very pressing content from a

200
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,880
psychological point of view every day must have, let

201
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,340
's say, a psychological hold

202
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,639
that must be guaranteed and verified  for

203
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,620
his good and also for the good of the

204
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,660
colleagues who work with him for

205
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,639
free we usually say every six

206
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,060
months third matter we take care of the

207
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,919
Financial cybercreme i.e. those that

208
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,960
are illicit Financial operations

209
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,039
of a wide range and above all of a

210
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,139
particular thickness especially

211
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,899
as regards  it concerns the subject that today, let's

212
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,240
say, makes us smile a little because today

213
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,760
everyone wants to invest in Bitcoin, however it

214
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,979
is very dangerous to invest in Bitcoin

215
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,260
In the sense that every day we receive

216
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,779
complaints from small pensioners of small

217
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,180
entrepreneurs of housewives who lose

218
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,100
all their savings because they rely on

219
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,140
to false financial advisors who

220
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,300
Fr  they promise easy earnings in a short time

221
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,100
and make them lose all their money.

222
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,480
Here we also deal with this but

223
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,860
obviously when we talk about

224
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,620
Financial operations of a certain level it is clear

225
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,220
that we are talking about Financial cybercrime the

226
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,640
fourth sector is the sector linked

227
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,459
to the conscious use of the network

228
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,959
by minors

229
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
and therefore we say that we go

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,660
to schools almost every day and we say

231
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,959
that we create prevention campaigns

232
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,700
for children on the

233
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,040
safe use of the network and

234
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,560
our prevention activity against cyberbullying also falls within this area,

235
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200


236
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
so this  let's say it's the

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,920
panorama

238
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,620
rightly says doctor a cornerstone

239
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
that is training that what we

240
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,300
do even today and there must be

241
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,240
particular attention with respect to

242
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,279
schools to minors to teachers So here

243
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,519
quickly in your experience

244
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
of activity you found the first question

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,180
that comes to mind  ask that I would like to

246
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,560
ask all of you but I start from the

247
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,019
doctor  it has found fertile ground

248
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,540
in schools to speak in 2022,

249
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,700
let's say 5 years after a legislation

250
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,860
that introduced it years after these

251
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,899
problems, you will find

252
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,580
fertile ground within the school to

253
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,399
dialogue because I do too and

254
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,080
in short, we chatted before I find

255
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,760
perhaps more ground on the part of the kids

256
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,279
than on the part of the adults So you

257
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,200
break down an open door in the sense that the

258
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,080
law of 2017 So it's a law that is also

259
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,880
incomplete, let's say so that it should have been

260
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,980
the beginning to try to think

261
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,899
together about what could also be done

262
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,120
because it is a law that has given

263
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
enormous possibilities such as the creation

264
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,220
within an educational institution of the

265
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,959
figure of the contact person for

266
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,779
cyberbullying we obviously speak of

267
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,779
the very important tool from 14

268
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,660
years onwards that the warning of the Police Chief

269
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,220
and obviously also

270
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,160
possibility and I smile here that the

271
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,640
same minor of 14 years alone or

272
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,019
together with his parents can

273
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,660
request the removal  nor to the guarantor of

274
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,640
privacy of content that is highly

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,220
harmful to his person Now we are all

276
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,380
adults and vaccinated we are all grown up and

277
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,480
we know that talking about removal on the

278
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,000
net makes you smile a bit

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,279
definitive removal on the net you can also say

280
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,260
that I said it  frankly it cannot

281
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,420
exist and therefore this Then there is

282
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,459
also a huge problem the removal

283
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,800
of content on the subject of bullying on the

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,560
subject of many activities for which

285
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,940
the legislator has

286
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,339
recently intervened I think In short you have all the

287
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,899
problems of Revenge porn no then we have

288
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,000
very recent regulations  I'm

289
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,180
a bit of a lawyer but in 2019 we

290
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,860
had an alternative on Revenge porn which,

291
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,480
among other things, in my opinion can be perfected AND

292
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,740
improved like all regulations

293
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,480
In short, problems are often

294
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
written urgently instead

295
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,880
the deed remains, marshal major  I ask

296
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,920
you as a representative of the

297
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,019
carabinieri You too do

298
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,300
important activities I think it's preventive

299
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,760
But also  on the subject of Cyber ​​investigations

300
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,260
So I would like to ask you a little about

301
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,899
your experience, also always In the light

302
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,540
of this recent legislation, your

303
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,300
point of view on the matter on the

304
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,519
problems and activities that you

305
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,220
can carry out, in short, to help all of

306
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,360
us Yes, good evening everyone  again and I

307
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,860
connect to what Dr. has already said

308
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,899


309
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,180
Clearly the prerogative the specialty

310
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,240
on the subject of

311
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,220
cybercrime prevention and intervention in the

312
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,540
field of cybercrime with

313
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,940
cyberspace the legislator has entrusted

314
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,700
to the postal

315
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,040
communications police in this  sense therefore

316
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,560
the weapon of the carabinieri not Bassetti of

317
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,360
prevention Except clearly the

318
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,860
territorial arrangements that you all

319
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,260
know who mainly

320
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,720
carry out proximity and proximity activities

321
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,420
therefore I recommend the population Let's talk

322
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,579
about our stations

323
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,300
command stations company commands and also

324
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,940
We participate as does the

325
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,440
postal police  sometimes we did

326
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,839
Together with other branches of the

327
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,000
Police Headquarters we also participate in

328
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,459
meetings in schools and therefore we

329
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,100
provide tools and advice to

330
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,079
children especially minors to

331
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,600
provide them with full mastery a

332
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,360
full opportunity to correctly self-determine

333
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
their behavior

334
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,380
on the web So let's try to

335
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,480
contribute  to what we call

336
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,639
But as commonly known Precisely

337
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,519
a digital awareness because

338
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,260
in the end what we find when

339
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,920
we find ourselves intervening is not so much the

340
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,139
vulnerability of IT systems or

341
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,540
other critical issues especially

342
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,399
public but not only minors the people

343
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,360
who run into cyber crimes

344
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,620
are  inexperienced in the subject

345
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,240
basically do not know

346
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,480
the tool adequately and do not

347
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,060
connect their life on social networks or

348
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,680
even today we are also talking about the

349
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,200
metaverse they do not reconnect those actions

350
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,300
those behaviors the simple posting of

351
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,300
a photo a video with consequences in

352
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,519
life r  Indeed, neither the

353
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,980
victims of computer crimes nor

354
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,079
the perpetrators connect it sometimes we

355
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,240
also encountered this and then allow me and I ask,

356
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,220
however, dealing with it, in short, all

357
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,839
issues are also connected to personal safety

358
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,120
No, let's talk about it, in short, we are

359
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,820
here to talk about corporate security,

360
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,620
however  then we forget about

361
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,820
personal safety which is

362
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,560
important even in a family environment

363
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,980
No where the covip has placed us in a

364
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,079


365
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,560
much more delicate and perimetered area of ​​internal and family security if you will

366
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,120
allow me to use the term with

367
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,500
corporate security no so we all found ourselves

368
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,660
at  home all together with this

369
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,019
device or a little more who did Smart

370
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,220
Working other So there is also a

371
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,720
huge problem so my question

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,699
with respect to this That is, this problem

373
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,040
we have of a culture of security

374
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,079
No in general a culture of

375
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,300
IT security what is the problem  that you

376
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,000
find most precisely in

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,620
relation to these criminal activities  and

378
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,380
which then can also lead to

379
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,620
all bullying activities no So

380
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,199
harassment or all the others so what

381
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,839
are, let's say, the greatest risks that you

382
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,600
have been able to detect in your

383
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,339
activity also of contrast and

384
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,339
prevention with respect to these conducts

385
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,800
let's talk about the risks that  the

386
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,740
people people meet people like this a

387
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,440
risk more than lack of

388
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,839
safety training lack of protection on their

389
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,720
communication devices I summarize it

390
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,480
again it is a vulnerability a lack

391
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,720
of digital culture People do not

392
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,880
realize but I also want to give a

393
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,360
cross-section  perpetrators of cyber crimes

394
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,459
on the criminal or the person who Is

395
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,320
unknowingly Commit a crime

396
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,620
in cyberspace do not realize it

397
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,420
because they do not realize that behind

398
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,940
the avatar behind that username there are

399
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,480
real people there are behaviors that

400
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,300
have effects on the real world and

401
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,160
therefore crimes

402
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,279
of impersonation of access fraud extortion are committed

403
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,500
i to the computerized domicile therefore

404
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,260
the abuser's access to the

405
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,680
computer system and also the victims to make

406
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,420
a cross-section of the victim They do not

407
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,060
realize that perhaps posting

408
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,800
personal data relating to their own person

409
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,100
sometimes even very sensitive data

410
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,620
can be stolen and used in

411
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,959
a malicious way

412
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,839
by cybercriminals who, in the

413
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,880
case of cyberbullies, can use this

414
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,339
information to offend, attack and

415
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,380
therefore ridicule a person,

416
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,360
this occurs mainly

417
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,519
with young minors or

418
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,959
use that data in a

419
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,720
criminal manner or to make illicit profits by

420
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,820
reselling the data. In short, a whole world

421
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,000
that  by now it is known but of which not

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,639
everyone is the master Also because you

423
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
said the right thing I realize then by

424
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,040
taking care of myself a lot You

425
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,360
will tell me computer scientists that there is a

426
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,579
huge problem relating to empathy on these

427
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,860
types of conduct no that even

428
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,859
then  which leads to the hate speech which

429
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,260
also leads to the  common crimes such as

430
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,000
online defamation no So the

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
lack of direct contact with the

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,579
victim which is a huge problem

433
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,160
with this type of crime that

434
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,079
also pushes the perpetrator It would be

435
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,640
interesting to deepen it obviously

436
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,199
we have limited time But also

437
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,559
the  author to these kids who maybe

438
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,640
in real life and let's say Removing the

439
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,260
protective screen from which they feel

440
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,640
protected by the computer they would

441
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,299
never commit I can tell

442
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,919
children I was in a school giving

443
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,860
a conference on these topics and I

444
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,600
asked a very direct question I like it

445
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,900
be very direct with boys and i

446
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,299
got a girl she must have been

447
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,660
12-13 i told him you have you ever

448
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,179
posed a picture a little

449
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:56,220
skimpy a little here he said yes i

450
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,039
did i said well would you  this

451
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,500
same action in the square of your

452
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,940
town in the square of your town

453
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,940
Omg no I would never have done this

454
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,220
unfortunately it is a lesser awareness

455
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,380
of what the effects are  wings of

456
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,760
one's behaviors on the net therefore

457
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,059
certainly the decrease in

458
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,520
inhibitions is a theme the perception of

459
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,620
having a barrier on the screen in

460
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,960
hiding behind a nickname is a theme

461
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,660
and therefore I go back to saying that it is not the

462
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,480
perception that some actions can

463
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,059
be really harmful However  it was

464
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,100
n't enough for a girl to say something

465
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,860
like this to make people think about the effects

466
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,320
that can be had by the fact that

467
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,299
we then said it a sharing of

468
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,280
an image of any content that

469
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,460
is not fluid if it completely loses

470
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,980
control with let's say cascading effects

471
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,120
which can also be really

472
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,299
dramatic and so precisely on this

473
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,480
aspect I would ask Fabio and

474
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,179
Maurizio to

475
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,980
illustrate and explain their project

476
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,280
of bullying, therefore the activity

477
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,919
that you have done and are doing

478
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,260
very pervasive in schools with

479
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,080
parents and therefore on your side

480
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,780
In short, it is precisely training to make all of us understand

481
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,080
the importance of this culture of

482
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,480
safety  this culture of

483
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,179
digital behavior also So in the

484
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,940
meantime I naturally thank Mario

485
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,280
all those who organized

486
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,440
this meeting because it's always good to

487
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,539
talk about these topics even to

488
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,820
people who

489
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,500
are the majority as far as cyber security is concerned they

490
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,260
are all experts

491
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,000
I must say after 18 years  of Striscia la

492
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,820
Notizia as a correspondent for three years on Rai 1

493
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,559
Here this association was born a

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
couple of years ago together with Maurizio Siragusa

495
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,320
and Massimiliano De Stefanis who is then

496
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,080
the owner of Cyber ​​Team by-euro

497
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,600
informatica who, in

498
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,220
short, created this structure through them  to go

499
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,320
to all the schools in Italy and then

500
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,600
go around the various regions of Italy a bit

501
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,820
to try to do the same thing

502
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,740
that of course the forces

503
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,320
of order do prevention and information

504
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,340
only that we do it a bit

505
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,740
also in a  a little different In the

506
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,780
sense that we go from second

507
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,039
grade to fifth grade

508
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,020
because we then talk about bullying Pe  why

509
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,059
can't we talk about cyberbullying

510
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,280
already in the second grade Because

511
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
we still say mobile phones haven't

512
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,059
reached someone yes but gradually

513
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,799
growing up from the fourth grade fifth

514
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,900
especially by now everyone has it and

515
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,160
therefore we can also talk about

516
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,440
cyberbullying But we besides the morning

517
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,780
with the  kids we meet the

518
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,760
parents in the afternoon because the real circle must be

519
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,220
closed with the parents because those

520
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,280
responsible for everything that happens

521
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,260
are in the family but

522
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,419
we feel this right through the thousands

523
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,520
of kids we meet I say

524
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,240
more than saying things about bullying

525
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
Here I mean  anecdotes and

526
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,860
tell what the kids have

527
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,240
told us starting especially

528
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,700
many times from the fourth grade and

529
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,160
we find many times here

530
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,200
as regards the mobile phone that

531
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,020
many children already especially in the fifth

532
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,520
grade and then In the first and second grade

533
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,799
much

534
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,600
more parents  they don't have

535
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,700
mobile phone passwords that is this is  madness

536
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,520
because why do they tell us no in my father

537
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,860
doesn't have the password my mother because she doesn't

538
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,020
have to see what I write but

539
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,840
think of a 10 year old 11 12 who

540
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,900
is not supervised and therefore goes

541
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,700
through a whole series of things where they then have to

542
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,460
the police intervene but it can

543
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,659
often be situations

544
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,400
too late no like so many articles we

545
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,340
have seen and read or they say

546
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,860
no not sometimes the parents answer us

547
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,960
but I take away their freedom If you check

548
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,360
your mobile phone it is free or sometimes it

549
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,159
is  those who start to

550
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,159
misrepresent no And for privacy i.e. we

551
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,640
use words Sometimes towards

552
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,880
the children so we talk 10 11 12 years 13

553
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,880
years and we put everything into it and the real

554
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,679
responsibility is ours i.e. we

555
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,720
parents in theory really have to

556
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
take a step back to  resume

557
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,740
what parents should do

558
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,200
today Many times Here there is no longer

559
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,760
respect for the rules there is no longer

560
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,860
respect

561
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,240
for the people no And all this

562
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,860
comes  mirrored in the family why

563
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,260
do you say

564
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,200
this but if for example I see that

565
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,559
within

566
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,539
these children sometimes I always take my

567
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,100
cue from the younger ones it's because

568
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,840
then it's instead growing up they get worse if

569
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,120
many children I always talk about

570
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,679
hugs I don't tell children many

571
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,539
times  you hug each

572
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,400
other hug your parents Well there

573
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,260
are many children who say no my

574
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,780
parents don't hug me that is,

575
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,179
that distance begins to arise between

576
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,000
parents and children which is then easy for the

577
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,340
children and teenagers to stop saying

578
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,500
anything and find themselves  sometimes in

579
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,659
situations that they have to solve but they ca

580
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,179
n't make it and there the joker and the

581
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,000
cyberbully on people like this who are

582
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,059
fragile don't tell they create that wall

583
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,039
that we as an association try to

584
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,900
go and break because because the first

585
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,760
thing we always say attention

586
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,980
We have to talk  I'll give just one

587
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,020
example I'll give the example of the apple for example I'll give

588
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,120
birth to this That is, when

589
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,740
we see an apple it's beautiful No you  it's beautiful

590
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,840
yellow but if we leave it out of the

591
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,940
fridge for a while

592
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,740
the brown spots start to appear and then

593
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,940
after so many days it becomes completely rotten

594
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,620
the same thing I say guys if you

595
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,600
keep it inside and don't tell

596
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,400
your parents anything sometimes the  teachers

597
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,860
the managers and many times I have said it

598
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,679
happens that if no one listens to you there

599
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,059
are the police who are

600
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,539
present 365 days a year 24 hours a

601
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,520
day where on the other side if you are in

602
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,659
difficulty before doing any

603
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,299
nonsense  pick up the phone call he

604
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,400
will answer someone who will know you

605
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,620
then he must always give directions

606
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,799
because we have to say it calmly but

607
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,480
everyone knows it we have an

608
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,460
adult audience here and then they are far ahead of the

609
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,400
comparison We tell others that

610
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,419
is bullying is always bullying we say

611
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,940
calmly you die  that is, and you

612
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,640
can't die like the 13-year-old girl from

613
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,100
monopoli a few days ago because she

614
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,900
was excluded from a Whatsapp group and

615
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,400
because you love them  that they didn't want to go out

616
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,059
with her anymore and she committed suicide she

617
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,280
hanged herself in the bathroom of her house and her

618
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
mother found her still with the

619
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,720
phone clutched in one hand it's not

620
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,840
permissible but all of us So

621
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,940
we all can do something she says but  what

622
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,620
can we do but the same eventually

623
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,780
us for example as an association we are

624
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,940
ready to go to schools if you

625
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,140
put us in contact

626
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,080
naturally through people you know We

627
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,419
are ready to go and talk and have

628
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,539
these meetings to try

629
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,100
to tell kids First of all what c  'there is

630
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,700
always someone who can help them and that

631
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,780
if it's not us they can be

632
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,039
teachers they can be parents it

633
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,659
can be maybe The order or people

634
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,520
Of course for places sometimes the

635
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,799
mayors are also present with us

636
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,480
and said many times go knock

637
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,580
even the mayor can give you a hand, i.e.

638
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,440
in the sense that you have to tell the kids that

639
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,960
many times they are fragile especially the

640
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,120
little kids

641
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,740
that there is always someone who  and he can

642
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,600
wait for your hand That is, we must send

643
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,940
a positive message and it is

644
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,740
certainly not I think that our

645
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,740
meeting today wants absolutely a

646
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,460
lot thanks to Fabio

647
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,340
I noticed and I don't know if in short

648
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,980
you also definitely noticed In short

649
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,140
you more no  Maurizio The big problem

650
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,600


651
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,299
is the isolation the loneliness that

652
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:49,260
the IT tool brings me the sign

653
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,520
boys A little older because they are

654
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
twenty years old when he sends me

655
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,960
back to university I always say you are the

656
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,000
children of the mothers and fathers of the very

657
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,679
good morning coffee  of

658
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,980
digital culture Zero No The boomers The boomers we

659
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,600
have we all know that we have a

660
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,360
generation gap they won't take it

661
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,220
badly 50-60 years they are the ones who

662
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,620
send Aunt Pina

663
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,140
that image every day and it doesn't exist by the way

664
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,700
even if you  you don't answer her every

665
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,080
day she sends you Happy Wednesday Happy

666
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,940
Thursday Happy Friday with hearts and

667
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,100
kittens and there is a huge problem of

668
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,620
lack of culture and there is also a

669
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,419
huge problem  because I saw it

670
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,900
too and the parents when the child

671
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,539
uses the mobile phone they use the

672
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,640
mobile phone as a nanny thinking my

673
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,080
profile is a genius instead the thread only

674
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,580
the opposable thumb So in reality

675
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,320
it has no more difficulty Here

676
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,419
we say that the mobile phone is created  to

677
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,159
have

678
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,380
Mario I'm not saying nutue experience with wires

679
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,580
but you know that they only have one

680
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,799
opposable thumb all four of yours So

681
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,200
the problem is that we give These

682
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,539
tools and information technology In my opinion

683
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,179
these chats are profoundly lonely

684
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,460
This absence of communication We

685
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,440
have grown up Hooray  With still

686
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,760
friends they called me on the phone they called me on the

687
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,460
buzzer we spoke and now

688
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,159
instead there is This isolation In your opinion

689
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,740
So also in your opinion in

690
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,200
your experience This is the real

691
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,480
problem in the sense that the kids speak

692
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,380
little the fact also of understanding and saying that

693
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,900
there can be all different figures

694
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,659
from the lawyer, the forces of order to the

695
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,200
martial arts, now we come

696
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,179
to the associations  on the territory

697
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:29,240
we could help them we can do something

698
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,220
absolutely yes we can do something

699
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,740
right at your last

700
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,080
thought precisely because going

701
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,580
around the schools that's what we do is

702
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,059
actually collect the photograph from the

703
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,020
kids and their parents and on average

704
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,779
a child starting from 10-11

705
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,700
years the average that we have more or less

706
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,760
calculated and that he spends about 5 hours a

707
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
day on his cell phone

708
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,320
to which the teachers are the first to be

709
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,059
amazed they say but how do they leave

710
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,740
school at four how do they spend 5

711
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,720
hours on their cell phone so This shows

712
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,000
how they  Then as soon as they have the

713
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,799
opportunity because rightly so in

714
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,299
schools they don't let them use it

715
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,960
so someone

716
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,000
on the cell phone we are 5 now cell phones a

717
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,260
day I mean this so that it's

718
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,059
not always the kids' fault you see

719
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,700
they learn from us because they see us but just go for

720
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,159
dinner for dinner

721
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,020
in a restaurant and if you

722
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,700
look at how many people don't have a

723
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,140
cell phone in hand even adults only

724
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,679
then this port  to isolate them or believe

725
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,120
to live this totally

726
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,520
digital life by

727
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,799
creating lives by creating

728
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,020
jobs and not realizing as a point

729
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,500
the captain said earlier that there is

730
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,480
something

731
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,760
problematic there are crimes from fa that

732
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,100
are committed with something even

733
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,580
normal because for  example one of

734
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,659
the examples I give with kids

735
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,419
just to go back to thinking I

736
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,220
always tell them I take you especially with

737
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,440
children up to 10-11 years old we go

738
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
to the toy store I tell you choose

739
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,520
a toy you put it in your

740
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,919
backpack and we

741
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,480
systematically go out everyone says  no it

742
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,840
cannot be done it is a crime one must not steal

743
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,820
this because I bring them to the fact that

744
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,799
we who are in schools know that on

745
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,640
average already at the age of 10

746
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,799
many have a Tik Tok account on

747
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,740
any Social or more Social and this

748
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,020
therefore leads them to  say Look, it's a

749
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,299
crime to go and steal But it's also a crime

750
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,159
not to tell your real age So you

751
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,659
're falsifying your reality

752
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,980
now it doesn't seem like  possible but

753
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,899
hypothetically Obvious then it's not like that but

754
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,240
to make him understand how there is something

755
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,399
that must be done also at the level of

756
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,500
conscience and above all the point is the

757
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,779
parents the parents for them the

758
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,940
cell phone is Good morning good evening kittens

759
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,240
and therefore it is heavenly world not  they

760
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,039
realize what is happening and they

761
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,140
don't realize for example the day before

762
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,299
yesterday Friday we were in a school an

763
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,520
11 year old boy has a channel on

764
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,679
YouTube and it has 15,000 followers 11 years old

765
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,480
and his parents didn't know it

766
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,100
belonged he could have it  and this

767
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,140
makes it clear that there is a gap So

768
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,000
what we try to make clear that is why we

769
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,860
work very hard to

770
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,880
collect this information But

771
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,140
we also work for the network parents

772
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,179
the possibility of saying Look,

773
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,880
however you can you have to do it because then

774
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,020
there is also a whole  series of

775
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,179
legal indications that sometimes

776
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,340
I can't imagine because they don't think at all

777
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,100
But yes from the mobile with the Yes who cares And

778
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,840
no because then the problem is not  it's not even

779
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,700
right to leverage I see it when I go

780
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,620
to school his parents

781
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,179
leverage responsibility Watch that if your

782
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,100
child does something you're responsible

783
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,620
In my opinion Let's say it's not the carrot stick it

784
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,000
doesn't work in this case

785
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,260
without a culture No Sure

786
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,580
No not  è You have to remove it from him you have to

787
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,679
keep an open channel you have to understand

788
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,480
a little at a time you have to open up to him I

789
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,320
highly recommend bullying plus

790
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,919
other behaviors that may

791
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,360
be soliciting for example now in fact I'm

792
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,220
going to see Claudio because he will tell us some

793
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,740
very interesting things

794
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,360
about know your enemy  it can be said

795
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,399
know your enemy in this

796
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
coveted field know yourself and know

797
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
Then know your enemy does not know

798
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,720
yourself 50% Win 50% times lose

799
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,299
know

800
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,679
yourself and know your enemy every

801
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,899
time Certain victory because I asked

802
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:31,140
to you Claudio what is it or what do you do

803
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,240
what you have been doing for years because you do

804
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,100
something wonderful so you have to

805
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,980
tell everyone

806
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,120
zanchin Tech What does

807
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,159
zanchin do is a Japanese word that

808
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,860
means mind In the here and now it is the

809
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,620
mind of the Samurai of the warrior who

810
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,600
does not panic and if he is

811
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,640
attacked he stays with the mind In the here and

812
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,460
now Tech from technology us  we are the

813
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,020
first martial art

814
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,419
known worldwide that

815
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,220
deals with digital conflict not

816
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,919
physical conflict in the physical world there are a

817
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,480
finite number of ways they

818
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,860
can harm you

819
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,200

822
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,279

823
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,020
money if I want to rape you if you have a

824
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,399
different skin color than I

826
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
like you are interested stop the punch stop

827
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,580
the kick use my grip  on your

828
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,520
wrist to bring me down and influence

829
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,440
the aggression by stopping single

830
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,840
techniques the aggression is a succession

831
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,419
of single techniques but you can't do it you

832
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,260
are learning a true martial art

833
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,899
which is not sport but is first of all

834
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,419
knowing how to manage one's emotions knowing how to

835
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,039
dominate one's fear one's

836
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,220
panic and having that martial mentality

837
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,159
for which Yes I can do things but

838
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,559
no I absolutely don't want to do them

839
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,980
except in case of absolute necessity  now

840
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,200
bring this In the digital world

841
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,059
we have been dealing with cyberbullying since

842
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,679
before it was talked about in Italy since

843
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,240
before the case of Carolina Picchio

844
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,740
Since the schools told us so much in

845
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,899
Italy it will never arrive

846
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,760
I come from the Hacker World like many of

847
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,799
you when they asked me  to deal with

848
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,120
Cyberbullying done the only thing I

849
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,899
knew how to do I studied I disassembled and I

850
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:17,640
understood how it worked

851
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,039
and if you dismantle

852
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,039
cyberbullying soliciting stalking

853
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,320
online soliciting and then kidnapping

854
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,360


855
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,460
minors scams against the elderly you will

856
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,720
eventually find 15 techniques

857
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,700
fifteen always the same patterns that are

858
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,700
in movements that the aggressor makes to

859
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,559
fool the target not victim

860
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,299
target you are victim If you give up  Here is

861
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,360
the martial art you are not a victim you are a

862
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,740
target and of the offender and target

863
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,700
the aggressor is the weakest because

864
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,299
the aggressor depends on you he has a need

865
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:59,760
so if in the physical world someone

866
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,860
takes my wrist and I step

867
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,140
back then  she follows me if in the

868
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,600
digital world an attacker lures a

869
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,760
girl and the girl is trained in

870
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,879
zanchitech the first thing she does breathes

871
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,119
then moves and takes him to a

872
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,219
system where she can control him

873
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,639
Beatrice 13 years old a few years ago

874
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,339
hooked up on Facebook by

875
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,899
Fabio tutti  fake names and I have to think about it

876
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,219
because the real ones come to me I have to

877
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,080
be careful

878
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,300
sixteen year old from Turin cute blonde

879
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,099
gives lots of compliments she is trained

880
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,619
in zanching the martial art repeating so as

881
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,659
not to repeat she has done it a thousand times in the

882
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,119
Dojo recognizes the techniques recognizes

883
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,760
Safari signals online surveys and

884
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,399
above all she has the discipline

885
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,980
he hooks her up compliments a series of

886
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,960
things and she says something is wrong here

887
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,879
decides to move  rsi on WhatsApp and to

888
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,580
take it to WhatsApp it's true She exposes

889
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,200
the number but having done zanji in the meantime

890
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,339
she has already asked her parents to

891
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,720
change her number because she

892
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,280
realized that in the past she has given it a bit

893
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,540
too much so she knows  since that

894
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,160
number there will be deleted In a few

895
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,800
weeks he exposes his

896
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,500
and she identifies through the telephone number

897
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,000
who this person is because

898
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,160
we trust her she has reached such a level

899
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,260
that we have taught

900
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,240
her and she finds from the telephone number that

901
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,820
Fabio aged 16, blond, cute from

902
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,460
Turin, he is 25, his name is Alessandro, he is not from

903
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,740
that city but from another city, he is an

904
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,599
extremely violent neo-Nazi extremist, he

905
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,020
praises burning all the

906
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,339
homeless at night with a petrol tank. He

907
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,440
is registered on dozens of sites

908
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,020
of society prostitutes and porn sites he is

909
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,480
a violent 25-year-old obsessed with sex

910
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,579
who pretends to be a sixteen-year-old to lure a

911
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,440
thirteen-year-old don't indicate your partner

912
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,060
of it's not him no it's not true

913
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,980
he's a pedophile

914
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,980
the first thing Beatrice does What do you think it

915
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,880
is she

916
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,339
breathes and calms down because the

917
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:00,960
martial art teaches self-control

918
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,359
Then she calls us because you are

919
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,700
never alone we have a

920
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,079
rule called the triangle rule there must

921
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,940
be at least three  she called

922
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,260
all four of her sensors made

923
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,760
a pentagon but the pentagon cooler than

924
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,859
a triangle We love it so much

925
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,020
we checked the

926
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,280
surveys too she told us sorry first

927
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,099
time i really do

928
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,859
not in the real world cause digital is

929
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,420
real  we get used not to say

930
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,400
virtual but to say digital physical

931
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,200
because both are real But she has

932
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,300
only made simulated investigations in the Dojo the

933
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,339
first time she really does it we do

934
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,079
investigations we identify this subject we

935
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,460
confirm hers her things

936
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,980
hers her inferences she  calls by

937
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,960
name with real name and tells him I know who you are

938
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,280
leave And he replies caught period and

939
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,960
that point is non-verbal communication

940
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,380
In the digital caught pu  nto closes the

941
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,540
chat closes the profile he disappears

942
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
at which point we report him to the

943
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,579
police all this happened in 9

944
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,140
minutes

945
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,560
from when he arrived to when

946
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,780
she sent him without threatening

947
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,000
him without telling him Now I'm reporting you He

948
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,579
forgot about her then  we have marked it by the

949
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,040
police because they think about

950
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,260
doing this job martial art does not

951
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,359
create Vigilantes martial art

952
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,099
creates people capable of managing

953
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,740
digital In our case aggression is

954
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,780
able to talk to one's

955
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,640
aggressor  able to influence it

956
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,859
able to gather the information

957
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,060
necessary to file a complaint lawsuit and

958
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,040
that's it and then it stops and above

959
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,160
all capable people people who use

960
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,839
technology before and better than those who can

961
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,480
hurt me from 11 years of age I

962
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,099
can assure you  that I have little boys

963
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,060
two days ago we did a

964
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,420
simulated survey and two 13-year-old

965
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,300
girls identified the

966
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,460
whereabouts of their hypothetical partner in 20 minutes

967
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,260
who posted a status on whatsapp because

968
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,740
she ran away from home and decided to

969
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,480
go and meet the love of her life she

970
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
met two weeks print on the

971
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,540
internet it was a simulation but based

972
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,280
on a real case that happened to me and

973
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,180
them in 20 minutes  Thanks to the osint they

974
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,680
identified the exact spot Where it

975
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,540
was in 20 minutes it means that then

976
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,520
I can call them and tell them there is a

977
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,380
girl dressed like this So go

978
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,700
get

979
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,880
her the power of the osint The power of

980
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,980
the investigations we can do

981
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,980
up to  a certain point and we can do them

982
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,420
I would say the hairiest power

983
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,140


984
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,960
of a mind in absolutely order and

985
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,400
also the power of the fact that

986
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,859
on the other side there are those who don't know Can we

987
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,079
protect their privacy we have to

988
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,359
say it because then we can too

989
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,640
I deal with defensive investigations we

990
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
can we have to stop and we have to

991
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,020
ask we have to ask We need to

992
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,119
ask for the intervention of the

993
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,420
police because some investigations

994
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,180
some measures the all  alert on the

995
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,800
territory that must also be done

996
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,900
because if a girl happens that

997
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,079
subject goes a girl a boy that

998
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,119
subject must be identified and reported

999
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,720
because he is absolutely stopped So

1000
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,240
obviously we can get to the

1001
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,000
preventive side we absolutely can These

1002
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,520
techniques are essential for

1003
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,780
helping fragile and weak people to  have the necessary

1004
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,380
measures to know understand

1005
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,160
Don't be afraid and understand to

1006
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,460
ask for help to communicate to talk

1007
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,800
about creating this network that I said

1008
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
at the beginning we must always

1009
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,359
do to help If we really want that

1010
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,359
I am someone who is on the web

1011
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,940
always been since Practically I

1012
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,520
put I took my first steps and I

1013
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,740
studied it and the idea that came

1014
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,060
at the beginning of this network of

1015
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,859
collaboration in which we could all

1016
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,900
help each other no and the nitiquette and

1017
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,119
whatever else is not lost i.e. the

1018
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,480
education rules networking so I think

1019
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,160
it's important because when they're

1020
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,839
attacked they'll be alone they

1021
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,400
won't be there  the parents will be nobody there It

1022
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,260
will be they who will have to make the

1023
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,060
first correct movements maybe not to

1024
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,380
even get into the aggression

1025
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,720
absolutely the first correct movements

1026
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,300
are fundamental and know what to do

1027
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,339
In the meantime I wanted to tell you if you have any questions

1028
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,859
raise your hands I will come now

1029
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,800
we are almost at the end so I want to

1030
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,140
respect the deadlines just to

1031
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,160
close on this aspect

1032
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,320
I would like to ask you at the

1033
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,440
final level so we are saying there

1034
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,060
are conduits of this type of

1035
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,680
many types we have seen on

1036
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,780
cyberbullying there can be

1037
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,420
grooming conduits knots soliciting relating to

1038
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,579
minors  in your experience in the

1039
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,079
area I ask you as a

1040
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,060
Carabiniere in short, in the area you are

1041
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,160
also not even in small towns

1042
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,200
in small realities So you have the

1043
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,700
possibility to intervene

1044
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,980
immediately

1045
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,320
what three pieces of advice would you like to

1046
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,960
leave precisely on the issues of

1047
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,480
cyberbullying in addition to training

1048
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,000
therefore in addition to c  o understand to families

1049
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,480
That is, what a parent must do is

1050
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,760
warned if there are Alerts relating

1051
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,619
to a minor So what to do the

1052
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,420
right strategies to know how to behave

1053
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,099
with these kids knowing how to communicate with

1054
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,000
them

1055
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,060
Good evening everyone

1056
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,500
what I feel like saying to the

1057
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,079
families of these  people who unfortunately

1058
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,599
suffer from bullying and

1059
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,619
very violent behavior and to

1060
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,300
present themselves in any barracks We

1061
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,160
are open for everyone we can talk

1062
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,339
about anything I have

1063
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,440
often found myself in front of little girls who

1064
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,500
cried without their parents who

1065
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,599
told In your opinion about cyberbullying and

1066
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,260
also about bullying I can say let's say the

1067
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,760
name of the Carabinieri that we

1068
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,720
are open to any kind of dialogue

1069
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,579
we try to do everything possible and

1070
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,940
people who are specialized in

1071
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,940
techniques of osint are welcome associations that

1072
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,420
help and also help people to

1073
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,099
let's say to solve even  practically

1074
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,800
under the digital point of view

1075
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,260
these associated problems  actions that

1076
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,000
therefore help in the digital path for the

1077
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,560
configuration of the contents because

1078
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,440
very often it is normal there are

1079
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,660
people but I don't know how to remove the

1080
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,460
contents therefore these

1081
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,339
associations are welcome and the experts are welcome

1082
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,440
also of osi in which in the analysis of

1083
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,180
open sources that can give us

1084
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,119
further support to our

1085
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,599
investigative activities I personally

1086
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,940
found myself faced with a wall several times

1087
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,920
especially when it happened to

1088
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,599
question these minors In the presence

1089
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,040
of the lawyer's parent with answers let's say

1090
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,900
I don't want to talk

1091
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,040
I don't want to talk So  there was and there was

1092
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,020
also a sort of wall between the parents

1093
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,560
in which the minor,

1094
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,380
let's say, often interrupted any type

1095
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,180
of argument that the parent

1096
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,380
tried to make and at that point. At that

1097
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,240
point it is very important to fight

1098
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,060
this phenomenon because these phenomena,

1099
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,880
let's say, create a preamble to  future and

1100
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,099
future let's say criminal conduct I

1101
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,880
think we're all here  found

1102
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,640
both as children and even currently in

1103
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,920
conditions where we were perhaps even

1104
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,140
for a small time lapse mocked

1105
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,619
by the group no and let us imagine if these

1106
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,220
behaviors that one already has, let's say

1107
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,579
at an early age,

1108
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:56,000
begin to form under a disparaging aspect,

1109
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,560
even wanting to be

1110
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,859
criminal with conduct  violence and

1111
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:06,560
others let's say conduct that can

1112
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,000
create considerable psychological damage

1113
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,579


1114
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:12,839
projected into the future when these

1115
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,300
people will have matured because

1116
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,420
perhaps for some people it is

1117
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,540
a moment of an era where everyone

1118
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,920
is joking a prank but

1119
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,420
for others for other types  of

1120
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,800
a behavioral nature this can

1121
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,099
can create conditions for, let's say,

1122
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,280
any

1123
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,900
type of person to commit a crime that is why,

1124
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,180


1125
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,099
for example, juvenile criminal proceedings are also

1126
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,260
completely different no

1127
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,300
Yes there is the institution of probation

1128
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,740
i.e. The  observation so on these

1129
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,839
guys let's say that poss  to happen

1130
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,240
an episode of this type can be

1131
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,400
symptomatic of something else even at

1132
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,220
a criminal level Or it can be a

1133
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,220
passing episode that can happen even more

1134
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,079
because of what we said to each other That is, due

1135
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,579
to the fact that this lack of

1136
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,480
empathy creates no one says the

1137
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,339
In short, the bully creates the subject who perhaps

1138
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:12,960
would never do an activity of this type

1139
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,660
in real life So

1140
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,920
the 15 techniques that we have identified

1141
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,020
in cyberbullying are all there now

1142
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,040
I have told you about a case of solicitation

1143
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,560
because the fastest time I have

1144
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,260
was already over  but while in

1145
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,420
cyberbullying there are all 15, in

1146
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,339
solicitation in scams there are a

1147
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,099
subset of them and we are studying the fact

1148
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,400
that some of the cyberbullies then

1149
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,900
specialize by becoming great because

1150
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,020
they have understood that this works and have

1151
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,119
other types of criminal conduct based

1152
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,540
on what they  they work so it's

1153
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,060
true Cyberbullying is everything

1154
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,819
that can then lead to various other

1155
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:52,500
conducts eg  r what makes sense to

1156
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,339
study even with adults

1157
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:57,060
absolutely last and I'm closing

1158
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,640
We are in the times there really would

1159
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,740
be a lot to say But obviously if you have

1160
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,839
questions we have time and therefore raise your

1161
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,119
hands I'm coming to you but let's say I

1162
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,740
don't even want to steal time from the  other

1163
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,660
speakers and I also close by

1164
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,960
hooking

1165
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,940
up sometimes with the family but I too see it

1166
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,280
as a lawyer when I am called there is

1167
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,780
this difficulty sometimes with the parents I

1168
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,060
prefer them to come out that they would come

1169
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,339
out maybe we stay in the room

1170
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,319
charitable with you of the forces of the  order

1171
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,780
That you do this important job

1172
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,960
so that we can talk I

1173
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,420
always tell my friends too you would never lose your child

1174
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,000
no And then we too think

1175
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,160
that we have to rely on

1176
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,000
third parties because we could not and are not

1177
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,760
able to manage when there are  'it's a

1178
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,619
close important heart relationship we won't

1179
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:50,040
be able to manage the situation in the most

1180
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,220
concrete way so my

1181
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,380
Let's say what I hope that  which I

1182
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,640
could see from personal experience

1183
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,220
and precisely because Closing this event

1184
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,240
We have so many different personalities

1185
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,339
trained in the area that

1186
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,200
we may have known today

1187
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,800
Thanks thanks to Kimbo we have them So

1188
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
let's try to network not to leave

1189
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,220
anyone alone let's try to continue

1190
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,680
create a digital culture that also

1191
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,200
an emotional culture that serves as

1192
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,500
important for our future for

1193
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,700
our young people who are our tomorrow

1194
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,619
so I hope that in short this

1195
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,780
opportunity this chat to

1196
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,480
help the kids the children let's remember

1197
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,280
that we are bullied that the bullies must be

1198
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,640
helped  we both don't have to say

1199
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,680
what needs to be arrested I want

1200
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,859
to hear Sometimes teachers Genoa

1201
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,619
are decriminal No no be careful

1202
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:49,020
because children aged 11-12 13 years should be

1203
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,020
Helped both because the bully many

1204
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,920
times has many difficulties behind him and

1205
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,920
that sometimes  in families and therefore I want to

1206
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,960
clarify this concept correctly

1207
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,880
Others  minds it seems that we climb against

1208
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,099
the bully It's always nice Sure these are things

1209
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:06,540
they don't have to do but you have to

1210
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,060
bring them and make them understand the things and

1211
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,680
the mistakes they're making

1212
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,020
Then of course all this depends on age

1213
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,300
Sure Sure it's clear how I say

1214
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,460
cyberbulli che  they made

1215
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,680
that 14-year-old boy commit suicide in Campania a

1216
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,839
month ago It is clear that there are other things that are

1217
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,760
a little more particular but here

1218
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,220
we try to Here we have to

1219
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,400
talk Here the kids talk a lot we need to

1220
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,500
go back Here to that dialogue with the

1221
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,180
kids and explain many things to them  because

1222
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,520
they are technological they are

1223
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,040
ahead of many parents but many

1224
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,920
times they don't know the consequences

1225
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,319
so the forces of order are welcome who

1226
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:44,880
go to schools etc. because

1227
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,319
we also explain it to them because we

1228
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,640
often bring lawyers

1229
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,520
into our

1230
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,339
meetings too  because they must then know

1231
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:56,400
what each action entails and therefore the

1232
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,099
consequences So thanks to you too

1233
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,140
today because  with such an audience

1234
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,060
we can certainly take this

1235
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,540
verb a bit everywhere so we are

1236
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,640
really like a bullying association No

1237
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,020
thanks we really go all over Italy

1238
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,660
and we met thousands of young people

1239
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,060
and we are happy because so many young people

1240
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,400
Continue again Here's to thank us

1241
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,859
today for meetings that  we go and we

1242
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,220
do them many times

1243
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,020
Yes yes Carabinieri commander because

1244
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,819
many times you also go to villages and

1245
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,260
therefore it is much easier to have the

1246
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,420
commander who knows all of you even

1247
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,740
with the postal police

1248
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,180
I collaborated last summer no

1249
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,400
last year  school I've been with

1250
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,300
the lorry they have a beautiful track Yes

1251
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,540
but it's beautiful because

1252
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,220
this thing is beautiful because all the

1253
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,119
school children go to

1254
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,579
this this track In short, which runs in

1255
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,260
some cities of Italy a beautiful

1256
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,300
initiative also this one of potions I

1257
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,680
close doctor  He wanted to make a

1258
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,180
clarification. I only wanted to say this

1259
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,859
for the Siam Tracker  o the ninth edition

1260
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,720
we also went to Slovenia and

1261
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,579
Moldova in Albania this year because

1262
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:08,400
they recognized it as let's say an

1263
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,680
educational program that other countries

1264
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,819
don't have and therefore they want to

1265
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:18,119
add it to us this is the So losite is

1266
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,160
a fantastic thing but it's not  then so

1267
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,099
simple in the sense that today WhatsApp has

1268
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:24,720
already passed online soliciting does not

1269
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,640
happen with Whatsapp online soliciting

1270
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,440
takes place with telegram not with

1271
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,420
WhatsApp and entering telegram

1272
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,400
therefore they are closed groups is not that

1273
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,960
simple So the advice I

1274
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,119
feel like giving if  there are parents here it is

1275
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,660
essentially this Since the web is

1276
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,060
an extraordinary possibility and

1277
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,180
above all a fascinating tool

1278
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,280
carrying out investigative activities a child of

1279
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,260
11 12 13 years in my opinion a little

1280
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,680
dangerous

1281
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:54,000
is still dangerous So I am

1282
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,380
obviously it is a police who has a  certain

1283
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,119
target therefore I always recommend this

1284
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,540
So first of all it

1285
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,680
is important to know 10 11 12 13 years

1286
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,960
What are the applications  cation that our

1287
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,059
son has on his cell phone because unfortunately

1288
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,280
not everyone knows how to use these

1289
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,500
applications, so WhatsApp for heaven's sake

1290
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,480
we all use it today there are class groups

1291
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,920
that have WhatsApp but in reality

1292
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,800
if a 11 12 13 year old boy on

1293
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,059
telegram on the  cell phone we have to

1294
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,819
worry but not because telegram itself

1295
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,619
is Who knows Let's say it's criminal

1296
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,480
Absolutely not but it is an application

1297
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,819
that allows us to do certain things

1298
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,339
in a secret way in quotation marks

1299
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,500
enter groups that are particular

1300
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,960
above all to navigate the Dark web alas

1301
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,579
because there are  obviously of the

1302
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:43,380
technological systems that our children know

1303
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,839
and where they go so I always advise when

1304
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,579
in doubt

1305
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:50,520
to contact the police in any case

1306
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,460
When in doubt always contact

1307
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,859
a parent because there are

1308
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,140
situations in which to do well even

1309
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,300
to try to unmask  the bad guys in

1310
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,339
quotes we can find ourselves in

1311
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,920
bigger problems than us so good these

1312
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,200
these these s  tudi for charity But let's

1313
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,880
always remember that we are talking about

1314
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
children aged 11 12 13 who are not

1315
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,800
attributable and who unfortunately find themselves

1316
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,240
facing a world that is bigger than

1317
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,700
them And even if we say they want to

1318
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,500
shield themselves in some way and defend

1319
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,059
themselves not  they have the ability to do it only

1320
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:22,559
this thanks

1321
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,880
Thanks to all Thanks Mario for the invitation

1322
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,520
and

1323
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,500
release the floor

1324
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,000
We have gone a little over the time you

1325
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,240

1326
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,859
I don't know if

1327
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:41,339
not ok He meant something Sorry if

1328
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:42,660
we blacked out for a few minutes

1329
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,540
Excuse me

1330
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,559
Rightly  it is important to know

1331
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,660
the application it is important to know that

1332
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,380
you can check and I say it

1333
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,520
in the sense of applications to know

1334
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,800
what the children are doing but also pay attention to

1335
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,200
all the game chats Because

1336
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,720
all of them spend time chatting

1337
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,720
inside the game chats of the various

1338
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,460
Consoles and  so even if they don't have a

1339
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,859
cell phone, everything goes in there

1340
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:09,059


1341
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,900
