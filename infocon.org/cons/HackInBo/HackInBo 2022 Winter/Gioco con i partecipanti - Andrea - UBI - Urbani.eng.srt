[Laughter]

8
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:42,180
I put attention at risk  down there

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,680


10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,559


11
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,239
You know You took the chocolates I know

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,059

no wait

17
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,440
instead I'm not much  aerodynamic

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,700
We have a masseur

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,820
now more Ninja stars

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,299
So first

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,540
of all for everyone all the people in the room you

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,159
have a very important role in this

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
phase Now I'll give you a small recap

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,900
because

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,060
for whom I mean I saw that there were so many

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,439
hands raised that he had never

27
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,820
come yet So  let's do a minimum recap

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,280
you want a fundamental role you are

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,380
the public

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,979
's help the public's help can help the

31
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,960
participants in this game or can

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,759
deliberately by the will of the public

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,820
put them  i further in difficulty

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,380
therefore it is fundamental So you will be able

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,360
to answer in a completely anonymous way

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,420
the questions that will be

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,119
asked is a sort of Jehovah of and

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,899
answer the questions that are

39
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,899
asked and the participants will be able to take

40
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,899
inspiration from your answers Who

41
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,000
are the participants the participants

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,720
six lucky ones drawn from the or volunteers or

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,140
drawn from the public who will compete

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,859
in two teams

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,599
Maurizio here you can also keep the

46
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,720
points because

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,040
I Alzheimer's so figured How we

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,640

participants who  they challenge each other here

51
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,680
So

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,940

precisely your contribution is key

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,460
you must choose a name too and a

85
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,199
sound to recall the thing but before

86
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,759
leaving Wait wait what I do

87
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,060

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,979
thanks like everyone else

89
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,380
for Mario for everything he does for the

90
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,000
fact that every time he makes us do this  to

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,020
Zombie still chased away

92
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,960
and then and then Big Mario who even

93
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360

101
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,759

Here we are

103
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,380

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,020
believers the public public at this

168
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,460

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,360
santisidoro  please let

172
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,440
us also confirm the saints

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,559
Isidoro ok

174
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,179
Congratulations because the first one was

175
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,240
difficult The first one is one The first one was

176
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
tough yes because my mobile phone so

177
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,740
maybe I had it in my pocket and maybe it didn't

178
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,860
take you well ok Please second question

179
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,140
so let's go back to the slides second

180
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,880
question if we start with things that

181
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,200
are a bit classic for us but

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,720
because they serve to warm up for a moment

183
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
if I say Christmas fl  ood what kind of

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,620
attack I'm talking about possibility

185
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,160
that we know to be called a

186
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
snowflake because the hosts that perform

187
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,360
the attack come from several

188
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,220
different points representing almost a

189
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,500
snowflake a Floating with all the

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,940
Flags active or a flottic small

191
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,820
Flag urgent c  'it is a flutex p which

192
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,040
shows only the flagwood people and in

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,180
this way bypass and some

194
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,500
the third test

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
is fine You are two equal but

196
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,080
appreciated No one had little

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
satisfaction on

198
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,519
25/12 which for me was beautiful the

199
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,380
problem of 25/12  that being English names they

200
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,720
should 12 25 grandissimo

201
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,940
[Applause]

202
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,820
an Italian had written then

203
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,240
I pray

204
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,180
to whoever has been given the greatest

205
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,640
Dos attack of which we have Data

206
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,640
here now here come on Now here we go a

207
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,279
little up now we are warmed up and let's start

208
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,660
with  the most delicious

209
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,219
thingsGoogle gitab or spam house

210
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,700
So I'll let you launch it like this

211
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,620
Look help from the public what it tells

212
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,040
you That is, you have Go please I in theory knew

213
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,320
Netflix that is not among  these, however,

214
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,300
were on avs infrastructure So I think

215
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,959
it's vs avs you say Okay it should be

216
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,660
we

217
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,560
are with Google Eh but let's see

218
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,620
it's Google slide dedicated to the answer

219
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,660
however You were just slightly wrong then

220
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,899
by Dos Ok

221
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,100
2017 Google sucks 2.54 terabits of

222
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,760
attack and even absorbs them and is then

223
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,899
declared

224
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,980


225
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,420


226
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,560


227
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720


228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,579
I didn't have it yet

229
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,980
then a bit did you see that I screwed a bit

230
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,260
the part where I have to be cool at a

231
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,079
certain point

232
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
next question

233
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
edified Which of these protocols

234
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,839
is not an industrial type protocol but

235
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,600
a complex algorithm

236
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,500
attention Google

237
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,300
scada profinet  svg4 or OPC ua

238
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,959
Bing

239
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,220
So here this question is even more

240
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,980
common I asked them first please

241
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,920
svg4 ok and you

242
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,660
go out like this four So now you

243
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,339
have to motivate your answer and give me the

244
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,459
full name of the a  algorithm please Beppe

245
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,519
Grillo

246
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,660

congratulations so but I'm still I'm

250

still ahead of them We are not even

251
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,820
you are even true

252
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,980
in the last 90 days the keys to covid or

253
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,639
Ukraine That is, therefore in the last few days

254
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,579
Ukraine has never passed  porn we're

255
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,300
talking about Google trans

256
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,360
Ukraine Eh

257
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,680
it's called keyboard dyslexia

258
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,680
link I remind you because it was present in

259
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,940
the last edition which is a

260
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,639
similar question therefore Spring always with the 90

261
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,339
days had already been there and gave us some

262
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,740
great surprises

263
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740


264
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,019
Ok So attention please let's go to the

265
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,160
answer no but let's go motivate

266
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,139
I say they were good in a

267
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,760
sense because let's go motivate This

268
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,100
was the same question only the

269
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
Ukrainian part of this year's Spring Edition was missing

270
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,380
in which incredibly against

271
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,899
all expectations  covid in one

272
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,399
moment overtook porn

273
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,620
That's right like to understand how much

274
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,600
we were in a real emergency now

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,839
Steps  love to the next slide

276
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,100
let's move on to the next slide

277
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,220
No later after there is the question Ah No well yes

278
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,839
there is in the recording this is an

279
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,600
old slide but let's move on to here

280
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,700
you see how the emergency has now ceased

281
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,880
That is, you didn't like it

282
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,100
we are calm  now porn has

283
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
resumed its place in our

284
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,139
social identity

285
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,959
so please next question So but

286
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,300
at this point In which city do we have the

287
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,040
highest search index in relation

288
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,260
to the Trend that won in the previous

289
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,839
question That is, in which city in Italy among

290
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,480
those that  we will

291
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,579
suggest here are these here they are really the

292
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,019
first Practically this is the

293
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,360
good part no

294
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,980
some I didn't know that it exists dry

295
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,420
no offense for maybe if there is some

296
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,800
inhabitant but I had no idea they even

297
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,019
existed Blink Blin a Fragola Because

298
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,000
Afragola has a  beautiful name I will be close to

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,079
Rome strawberry In my opinion why please

300
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,440
Maddaloni

301
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,100
please Maddaloni Maddaloni Then you both are

302
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,380
wrong now we will see but

303
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,699
I must say the truth was very  difficult

304
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,139
because when I found myself faced

305
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,019
with the fact that none of these had

306
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,220
my idea of ​​having to even more or less

307
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,100
where the strawberry was come on I don't know what it

308
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,560
was strawberry it would be strawberry but it's

309
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,060
near Naples Ah here I don't know

310
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,740
anyway it's  Licata and

311
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,760
let's take it on the slide Here it is

312
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,000
Licata in Strawberry Maddaloni Bronte and

313
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Pachino ready and Pachino I only knew them

314
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,720
for the typical products we were

315
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,720
closer We yes yes in fact if you are the closest ones

316
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,639


317
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,779
You will take the point in case of a

318
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,199
tie

319
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,740
no  and that is, that is, it is the percentage

320
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,240
in relation to the three searches

321
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,620
this is always the 90-day Trend in Italy

322
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,199
and I took the slides this screenshot

323
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,480
I took today but I had done it again yesterday

324
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,220
Obviously the same search and the cities

325
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,980
were different That is, therefore the power of

326
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,380
porn  no i.e. in the sense the result is not even

327
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,339
stable

328
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,600
please i.e. out of 90 days which is not what

329
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,320
you say about today understood

330
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,060
Someone pushed Bologna very hard it

331
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,720
should go to who suffered

332
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
the most  large data breach with exposition

333
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,380
of history and history up to

334
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,060
now that we know that we

335
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,339
know so Licata Facebook

336
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,880
Yahoo spambot or MySpace Facebook

337
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,100
you have the possibility of having

338
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,440
professionals in the room we throw away

339
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,660
But you have booked we let them

340
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,779
stabilize a bit

341
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,939
reasoning Meanwhile see

342
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,640
try a square

343
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,520
So we have Yahoo for many but

344
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,260
Yahoo and Facebook say a good

345
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,419
indication that spambot is given few

346
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,660
are convinced and never few are convinced

347
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,780
as gigabytes in room Then we don't know

348
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,140
In our opinion Facebook Facebook In your opinion

349
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,339


350
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,959
Facebook Also in your opinion Compliments

351
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,520
please because it's absolutely Yahoo

352
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,379
Yahoo we're going

353
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,380
the audience stopped at 42 to give you

354
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,440
the only correct answer that was here

355
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,140
So let's go on with the slide and

356
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,880
no there's one more thing

357
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,860
Ah why then I'll say it later

358
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,740
yes  anyway Yahoo got fooled in 2013

359
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,559
allow me the term 3

360
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,080
billion accounts without

361
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,820
Dash passwords but the  n short 3 billion accounts

362
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,980
which were then also thrown up for

363
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,679
sale so in short 3 billion and the

364
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,260
absolute record you could have

365
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,419
committed yourself to commit yourself to no we are talking about the

366
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,059
amount of data i.e.

367
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,880
data set let's say let's stay on the subject that has

368
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,039
undergone the largest

369
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,280
Beach Hack and  sponsor of 2022 let

370
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,418

371
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,440

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,360
game very used in the East that

ease of compression if I have a

406
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,500
child he won't sleep with me at ho  to

407
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,140
program 15,000 lines of code for

408
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,640
the site Here is another quote from me,

409
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,039
i.e. an ed of mine that says It seems to the day

410
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,539
of the context from which I extrapolated

411
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,120
this thing we need forecast and if

412
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,179
you don't sleep you can't make it

413

415
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,559
is, they are all possible in my

416
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,559
opinion Richard stallman

417
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,660
Captain Crunch which in my opinion

418
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,360
is also possible for him

419
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,160
Art Riser which given how it

420
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,720
turned out probably the son  I do

421
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,880

422

they kick us off the stage but we

456
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,179
also started a little later so

457
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,340
this is a question here we are talking about

458
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,080
questions about crypto There are a couple

459
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,900
2,3 written sent illicit addresses

460
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,760
What is the most typology of illicit

461
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
perpetrated i.e. through the i.e. of who

462
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
sends written to Lecce i.e. therefore

463
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,700
it is not very often who is sending them and

464
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,559
who suffered them we say i.e. we are

465
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,840

these data  they come from dinner analysis which

470
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,059
is a company that does forensic analysis on

471
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,020

478

this money mainly come  i.e. now

483
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,679
you have the possibilities obviously so

484
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,380
Central North and Western Europe North

485
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,679
America and be Europe or

486
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,179
Asia Oceania China

487
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,299
Bling

00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,039
please

489
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,840
North America North America also in our opinion

490
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,700


491
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,720
Well you should know that when I

492
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,700
ask these questions typically always because

493
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
I like it here to ask  see how much

494
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,580
not not you not you but how much we finish

495
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,380
Buffoons we in general in general in

496
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,740
absolute please look Obviously

497
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,799
who gets scammed the most

498
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,380
We are the ones who scam the most let's

499
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,220
move on to the slide

500
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:41,159
Here it is you see the percentage of

501
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,380
gray and all those who arrive for

502
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,360
scams And clearly it is the biggest

from 2019 2020 2021 let's see how it is

518
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,059
The Trend has changed that is in 2019

519
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,340
despite the quantities They were all

520
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,340
lower No in 2019 more

521
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,400
money was cheated that is more encrypted by checks And then

through millions of types of Hacks

523
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,860
beautiful and fun different and

524
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,900
contracted machines the defile has become the

525
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,940
target who is suffering the most from the

526
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,760
consequences of this thing

527
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,880

framework to which you can

541
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,140
magically register even online from  a short time and

542
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,679
which is the one that then, for example, gives

543
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
support to Italian  what rembacy when he

544

goes abroad Try to participate in

545
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,799
many realities according to Marchetta today

546
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,840
we have a project as well as including

547
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,760
the framework called hacker camper

548
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,419
is and is a camper that we received and

549
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,380
that we would like to fix and

550
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,940
transform Let's say into a basis for

551
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,380
go for when we go abroad

552
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,720
so PIN I'm talking about electronics and

553
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,820
technology but

554
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,659
use it for our travels

555
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,360

hackers more or less from all over  the world and

580

00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,880
is called Leonardo Federation in Italian

590
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,100
hacker or ufj and we have opened is an

591
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,140
invitation on stage Marco I can't see but

romaque unfortunately Mario

597

Giovanni merlos is not there at the

598
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,760
moment and we started a little bit

599
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,840
This idea came to mind all

600

together of c  try to create a

601
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,000
federation not even not from a factual point of

602
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,600
view that is, but a meeting a

603

this that is to group the

607
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,200
various  community to try to find

608
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,659
common synergy points and efforts

609
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,279
we are a bit trying to

610
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,279
build how it will work What are the

611
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,100
rules and

612
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,740

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,240
created a General channel in which everyone

615
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,399
they can register regardless there is

616
