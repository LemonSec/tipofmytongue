1
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,719

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
but i hope you can enjoy the talk and

6
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,200
the presentation

7
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,159
uh who i am uh

8
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
currently i am a security engineer at

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
small pdf previously i have worked for

10
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
arduino

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,560
i am i am of course an open source lover

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,360
and i am a linux user uh twitter

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
addicted uh you can find my account in

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
the slide uh everything

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,159
and uh i love cats and

16
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,680
but but both ties

17
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,079
what is this talk about

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
well uh

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
we will see three information operations

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
linked to two states

21
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,799
russia and china

22
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
are more correctly

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
lpc so people's republic of china but

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
probably i will say china because it is

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,360
shorter

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
i want to point out that this is not

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
means that west country didn't lead or

28
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,560
are not leading information oppression

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
just that twitter has not shared any

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
data saturated to west

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,319
west information operation except except

32
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,680
for one

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,720
a small information operation lead by a

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
political party in europe a spanish

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
party political party

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
party to popular

37
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,599
but we don't see this data set in this

38
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,800
dark

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
um

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
i want to explain also the methodology

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
that i have used to read the data set to

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
analyze the data set shared by picture

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,599
because it is important to

44
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
better understand how i am working

45
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
and

46
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,360
so i will present the script that i have

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
used to read the data set i will present

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
the limit of

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,159
the data set shed by picture the error

50
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
that the data set contain for example

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
the data that we haven't and the data

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
that we can extract also if they have

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,599
not a dedicated column in the csv file

54
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
because the twitter share

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
the file in a csv format

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,879
methodology

57
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
okay

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
all all the python scripts that i have

59
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
written or that i have used to read the

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,640
twitter dataset are in a github repo so

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
you can read them and

62
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
there are different script that i have

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
written to read the data set especially

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
you can see that

65
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
the most important one probably is tweet

66
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
analysis because it's a python script

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
sort of a command line interface because

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
you can

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
you can use it from your terminal

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,920
and you can use it to read for example

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
you can filter data according to the

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
languages of the counter or of the

73
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,959
twitter you can

74
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,400
filter

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
just per account so you can extract data

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
for a single account

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
and i want to thank to thank you uh i

78
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,839
want to say thank you to nicola balota

79
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,880
because

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
he

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
he has contributed to the project

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
in a very good way to

83
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,160
improve the performance of the script

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,360
in

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,639
i have used python uh to write my script

86
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,120
and in particular pandas enampi because

87
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,400
twitter shared the data set in a csv

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
format so it is quite easy to import csv

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,720
using pandas like

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
dataset and then you can

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,919
read

92
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,000
quite easily the content of the file

93
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,199
in the repo you can find also other

94
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,400
script

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
that i have used for example to uh

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
in to call the twitter api to collect

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,880
data in real time but similarity to the

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
dataset that i want to

99
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,759
present today

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
in particular tweet analysis

101
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
dot pi

102
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
can extract information related to the

103
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,919
tweets and retreat vermont uh

104
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,639
that

105
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
the account

106
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
have written uh so we can have a sort of

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
twitter bloomer

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
we can count the number of replies quote

109
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
retweet and hearts that

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,960
the tweet generated by the bots or the

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,039
account

112
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,479
in the starting the data set have

113
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
generated uh

114
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
the script can generate the tweet daily

115
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,080
read

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
the daily written it's really

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,320
important to understand for example

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
the target of a particular information

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
operation

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,639
and uh of course we can uh the script

121
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
can extract the account created by a

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
month

123
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
uh or tweet uh grouped by languages or

124
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,080
clients so uh what is the user agent

125
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
used to publish a particular tweet

126
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,680
and we have a word cloud of retweeted

127
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,479
the user and the hashtag

128
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,359
used in tweets

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,199
uh there are

130
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
two kind of information in my opinion

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
that we can extract from a data set

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
there are information that can help us

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
to understand the quality of an

134
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
information operation so

135
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,160
the hashtag the retweets user can help

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
us to understand uh what are the topic

137
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
or the uh the trend that the

138
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
account

139
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
have tied

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,319
to boost there are you can create the

141
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,240
user network so how the account

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,560
have interact with other accounts

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
but in the botnet network also with

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,880
other accounts

145
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,840
we can analyze a specific user because

146
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
in every network there are key account

147
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
or key user and then there are a lot of

148
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,840
other accounts that just amplify

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,720
uh their twitter or their messages

150
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
and then there are the shard link

151
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
traveling are really interesting

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
information because uh uh well in a spam

153
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
button for example there are a lot of

154
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,759
of fraudulent links uh that link to

155
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
fraudulent website

156
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
and um

157
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,599
but

158
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,720
in a

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,039
state link the information operation

160
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,639
usually there are links to other

161
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
platforms for example link to youtube

162
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,599
you link to other content like reddit or

163
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,319
link to a um

164
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,720
other website created by the by the

165
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
actors to spread a particular

166
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,319
information

167
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,360
and uh

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
for example we can see the other slide

169
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,720
but russian

170
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
operation has created a lot of

171
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,879
accounting different platform youtube

172
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,680
facebook twitter reddit tumblr

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
and they have created also original

174
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
content like a website and blog

175
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
so the shared links are really important

176
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
of information then there are the

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,599
quantitative information so we can

178
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
understand uh in which period there are

179
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,680
spikes or

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,240
or or in which period of the engagement

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
is grow

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
we can see the

183
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
user agent or the client used by the

184
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
actor we can see when the actor have

185
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
created the account for example and so

186
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,439
on

187
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
it is important also to understand that

188
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
the datasets shared by twitter don't uh

189
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
doesn't contain some data

190
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
for example we have no information

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
related to ip address

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
and

193
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,279
this information is really important the

194
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,160
twitter team has this information uh but

195
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
we haven't so we cannot be sure that uh

196
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
a particular group of accounts to it

197
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
from the same ip address for example

198
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
sometimes we have an information related

199
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
to the username or the twitter or the

200
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
twitter account id for example because

201
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,240
twitter decided to share the

202
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
account anonymized with the nash instead

203
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
of

204
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,839
sharing all the information related to

205
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,279
the username

206
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,320
um

207
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
we don't have information about follower

208
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
and following so we don't know which

209
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,279
account follow who and

210
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
we don't know if

211
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,440
they follow a particular key account for

212
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
example or not

213
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,040
and

214
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
we have

215
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
no information related to favorites so

216
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
we don't know if the

217
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
what account

218
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
have tried to

219
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
increase the engagement of order bot

220
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,200
account or they have just like all the

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,079
spam account and so on

222
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,800
and the tweets are trunked though uh

223
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
because uh the

224
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
twitter in the past

225
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
uh permitted just tweets with the uh 140

226
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,360
character character if i remember right

227
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,519
but now the twitter permits uh

228
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,560
280 character

229
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,680
but the api can uh collect ip uh just

230
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,120
with a limit of 140 for some reason i

231
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
don't know why

232
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,800
so there are some limits that we have

233
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
there are some information that we

234
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
cannot have

235
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,880
uh but using twitter api or by reading

236
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,680
the

237
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
data set shared by twitter

238
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,480
we need to answer this

239
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
then there are some errors also in the

240
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
data set

241
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
i mean uh

242
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
we are human so also the tutoring

243
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,720
engineers are human

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
and uh some twit uh

245
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
um languages uh are not uh i mean

246
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,880
sometimes some tweets are not classified

247
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
in the right way so the language is is

248
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
uh wrong

249
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
for many reasons because it is not easy

250
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,360
to classify in an automatic way um

251
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,720
the language is over tweeted that

252
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
non-con that that doesn't contain text

253
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
for example if it uh has just emoji or

254
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,480
if a tweet contains just uh images and

255
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
if the tweet is uh shorter

256
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,200
uh or too short

257
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
it is not easy to classify

258
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,880
the languages for example there are some

259
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,680
uh mean or error in the classification

260
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
of account for example in the first data

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,519
set

262
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
twitter uh shared more than 200 that

263
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,880
count that uh was uh misclassified uh

264
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
has a russian propaganda account but

265
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
they

266
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
were

267
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
venezuela propaganda accounts for

268
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
example and also in other databases we

269
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,000
can see that there are some accounts

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
initially suspended that

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,720
twitter has decided to uh re-enable

272
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
and then the data are is not so well

273
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
formatted and it is a problem if you

274
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,760
want to create to write your own script

275
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,399
to read them because for example we have

276
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
a lot of unidentified uh value we have

277
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
some

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,600
uh blank child or we have a nano value

279
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
and this is a problem sometimes if you

280
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
want to optimize skips to read a big

281
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
data set

282
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
so this was a

283
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,839
challenge when i written the

284
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,480
script

285
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,920
metadata uh water metadata metadata

286
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,800
um

287
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,440
data that can help have uh that can help

288
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,760
us to have more context

289
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,279
on

290
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,079
on the on a particular set of data so

291
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,560
they can discrete describe better our

292
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,600
data

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
for example we can

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
extract some information that are

295
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,959
very helpful to understand the

296
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,600
information operation like the retweeted

297
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,720
account

298
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
uh we can we can collect the username

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
and then we can try to understand if

300
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
twitter has uh suspended the this group

301
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
of account or not

302
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
uh of course uh some

303
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,079
propaganda counter can retweet

304
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,519
um trusted source like uh

305
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,920
mass media or

306
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
other political

307
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,720
account

308
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
but sometimes they they can also retweet

309
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,160
order bot

310
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,440
so understand if the uh retreated

311
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,959
account are still online or if they are

312
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,800
suspended by twitter

313
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,160
it is important to understand the

314
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
propaganda or the information operation

315
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,680
uh another important information are

316
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
related of course to shared link

317
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
and the snowflake id

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
can help us to extract the timestamp

319
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,279
related to the account creation or

320
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,120
the twitter

321
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
the twitter creation

322
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,399
what is a snowflake id a snowflake id is

323
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
a

324
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,079
a unique number uh that

325
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,880
a unique number that can scale in a big

326
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199
infrastructure like twitter

327
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,519
this is a format that was created by

328
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
twitter

329
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
and it has been introduced in production

330
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,199
in 2010 if remember right

331
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
which means that all the accounts have a

332
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,519
different id format

333
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,920
uh the first twitter user for example

334
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
have just an incremental number id um

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
the jack account has uh the id 12 if you

336
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,839
remember right and all accounts created

337
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,480
after the snowflake introduction have a

338
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
unique snowflake hiding and same for

339
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,800
tweet so

340
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,519
they

341
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,120
twitter id and the account id

342
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
use the same format

343
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
and every snowflake contains a

344
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
millisecond timestamp this means that it

345
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,959
can be really helpful to understand if

346
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,680
a group of account was

347
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
created uh

348
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,600
by automated tool for example or by

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
human because

350
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
if a group of canto has been created by

351
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
automated tool we have

352
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
probably timestamp that are

353
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
really close

354
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,959
how we can extract the timestamp from uh

355
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,360
there's no flakkedin

356
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
we need to convert the snowflake id into

357
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,240
a binary format we need to remove the

358
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,279
first bit

359
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,839
and we need to take the

360
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,800
first

361
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
41 bit this is a timestamp in binary

362
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
format so we can convert it in

363
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,480
base 10 and when we need to add a custom

364
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
constant epoch

365
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,199
and in this way we can obtain the

366
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,680
right timestamp as a timestamp in

367
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,519
millisecond of tweet and account

368
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,720
id

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,199
the timestamp in the account

370
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,079
id is the

371
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,399
the moment when the account was created

372
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
of course we can automate this uh uh we

373
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
can write a python script or a golan

374
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,839
script or what you prefer this is in

375
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,399
this slide you can see just

376
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,199
um a python script to

377
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,680
extract the timestamp from the snowflake

378
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,000
id

379
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
and

380
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,800
explain the methodology was important

381
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
for me because i don't want to convince

382
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,160
you

383
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
about my conclusion but i want to be

384
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,000
transparent in

385
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
how i have read the data

386
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,199
internet research agency

387
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,480
in uh october um

388
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,839
2018 twitter released two important the

389
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
first two data set associated to

390
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
two state

391
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
information operation one associated to

392
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,319
iran and one to russia

393
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,880
it is important to understand when

394
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
twitter releases these two data sets

395
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,160
because

396
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
in

397
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,559
2016

398
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,839
there was a

399
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,880
unity state present election

400
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,039
and

401
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,200
america has understood

402
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,480
late that

403
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
russia have tried to

404
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,400
create an interference in their election

405
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
in particular um

406
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
there was two important operations by

407
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
russia one associated to grew and one

408
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
associated to the internet success

409
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
strategy that is just a troll farmer

410
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
that four years

411
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,520
have spread misinformation

412
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,280
but we can find these uh um

413
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
this information operation also another

414
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
platform like facebook youtube reddit

415
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
tumblr so it is a cross

416
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,559
platform operation not just twitter

417
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
um

418
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,919
and in the united states uh

419
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,880
uh

420
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
this was a very hot topic when uh

421
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,200
they have understood that

422
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
russia has tried to to spread the

423
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,960
misinformation or

424
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
hack the opinion

425
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,840
okay

426
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
let's see some numbers in chart

427
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
we can see that

428
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,039
the

429
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,880
more than 50 percent of the accounts uh

430
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,039
were created between the uh 2013-2014

431
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,679
this means uh two two years before the

432
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,840
united state election because probably

433
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,039
uh russia

434
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
started to

435
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
to spread misinformation before the

436
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,320
united state election the united states

437
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
election

438
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,039
was on the first target for the uh

439
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,760
for the russian government

440
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,919
and we can see that uh

441
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,760
the tweet and the engagement are not

442
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,360
aligned so uh we have uh uh

443
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
the

444
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
we can see that the tweet was uh well

445
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,320
published uh between uh

446
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,880
2014 and 2015 but the engagement uh

447
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,559
grow only in

448
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,799
2016.

449
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
and we can see that the engagement

450
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
was really high

451
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,200
it is interesting to see

452
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
the languages

453
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
the 50 percent of tweets are written in

454
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,320
uh

455
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,280
in english and uh

456
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
the uh and the accounts are classified

457
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
as english account so the languages of

458
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,760
the account

459
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
but we can see also that there is an

460
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,080
important percentage of tweet written in

461
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,120
german for example

462
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
and

463
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
this means that probably

464
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
russia or i mean internet research

465
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
agency has tried to spread this

466
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,760
information also in germany but we can

467
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,879
see it later

468
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
the more than

469
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
60 percent of accounts have a

470
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,000
description and it is important and we

471
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
can see that well the most common word

472
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
is follow usually uh followed by me so

473
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
follow me it was quite common but also

474
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,320
now it is quite common that

475
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,400
spam account or just account want to

476
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
find follower and follow for follow is a

477
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,240
common practice to uh

478
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
to increase the number of followers

479
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
then we can see that conservative trump

480
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,600
maga make america great again are quite

481
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
common but also black lives matter

482
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
because

483
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,919
for

484
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
the internet research agency

485
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,840
it wasn't

486
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
important to

487
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,480
for example convince people to vote for

488
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,799
trump but it was important to polarize

489
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,679
people

490
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,440
so create two

491
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
um two group of people that cannot

492
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,799
communicate freely and uh increasing the

493
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,159
polarization it was probably the main uh

494
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,240
goal of the russian government

495
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,919
and this work really well in the united

496
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,960
states because you have just two parties

497
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,679
and you can vote just for republican or

498
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,960
for democratic

499
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,520
party so

500
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
polarized people

501
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,280
in this context

502
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,320
well i cannot say that it is easy

503
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,280
but probably it is a good environment to

504
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,320
try to polarize people

505
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,240
it is important to understand that

506
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
russia russian government or intersect

507
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
agency

508
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
started their propaganda not in the

509
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,840
united states but in

510
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,159
russia and usually

511
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,440
every

512
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,000
dataset shared by twitter show

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,200
propaganda that

514
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
is

515
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,120
spread or has been spread in their own

516
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,600
country so

517
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,799
also for

518
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,039
china propaganda we can see that they

519
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,760
try to communicate with chinese people

520
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,640
and same for russia initially we can see

521
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,799
that

522
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,880
the russian account so account

523
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
classified like russia were created

524
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
between

525
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
um

526
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,640
2013 and 2014

527
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,200
and we can see a spike in

528
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
june

529
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,880
between june and november uh 2014.

530
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,559
and uh

531
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,600
the

532
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,799
fifth more than 50 percent of tweets

533
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
are written in russia

534
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
and this because uh

535
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
the troll pharma

536
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,039
operations start to spread propaganda

537
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
to into russia or

538
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,360
closer to their border for example or

539
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,840
china

540
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,080
and uh

541
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
four out of ten most popular hashtags

542
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,640
are related to crina and the um

543
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
uh malaysia playing clash

544
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,880
uh this is probably uh the mo the main

545
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,840
reason why

546
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
russia has understood the potential of

547
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
propaganda on twitter and social network

548
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,840
in general

549
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,240
because in

550
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,360
in 2014 there was a

551
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
higher plan crash

552
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,080
during the conflict between ukraine and

553
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
uh russia

554
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,279
and the

555
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,919
russian decided to spread this

556
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,039
information

557
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,279
to try to change the public opinion

558
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,039
at the end

559
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,279
a dutch lead international team say that

560
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
the airplane was hit by a russian

561
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
missile launcher

562
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,279
but during

563
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,880
the july 2014

564
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,679
the

565
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,480
troll farm account spread a lot of

566
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,840
information for russia of course to

567
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,760
convince people that

568
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
russian wasn't involved in this airplane

569
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
crash

570
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
then they move

571
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,960
to english street to

572
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,039
american propaganda

573
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,840
so

574
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,799
they have

575
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,120
created an internal propaganda and then

576
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
they moved to

577
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,520
they have tried to export it

578
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,039
the

579
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,799
internet research agency started to

580
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,480
spread the disinformation two years

581
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,640
before the election so probably the

582
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
election

583
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
uh wasn't the first goal uh maybe they

584
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
wanted just to polarize people

585
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,880
it was a long strategy

586
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
and uh

587
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
it is interesting to see that the

588
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,720
engagement started to grow only uh in uh

589
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,600
2015 2017

590
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,840
uh also also after the uh

591
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
trump uh

592
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,640
trump election uh the president election

593
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
technology

594
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,919
but it is interesting to see the quality

595
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,559
of their uh information operation they

596
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,000
ever created a lot of local news a fake

597
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,640
local news account

598
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
for example we can see um

599
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,919
wait i need to read the graph but we we

600
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,320
can read that there are a lot of new

601
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
york city every day it is a for example

602
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,799
is a fake local news account

603
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,960

accounts

608
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,799
are fake and they created this account

609
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,440
in

610
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,880
2014 so two years before

611
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,080
the

612
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
president election

613
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
in the top mean the top

614
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,440
uh 100 master edited user by bot we can

615
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,039
find uh

616
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,760
in the top yes here we can found the 14

617
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,799
accounts

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,240
that are related to fake local news

619
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720

620
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,440
14 account change their username at

621
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
least one time over time i don't know

622
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,279
why but it is another interesting uh

623
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,400
interesting

624
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
information related to

625
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,600
the

626
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,360
internet success addressing propaganda

627
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,840
and then

628
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,799
hacking a local uh

629
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,640
local media you can also hack mass media

630
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
because after um the twitter

631
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,240
investigation a lot of

632
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,640
mass media and important journal like

633
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,200
guardian for example

634
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,399
have identified on their uh

635
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,200
on their article on their

636
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
news a lot of embedded tweets generated

637
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,000
or created by

638
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
the russian uh account this means and

639
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,559
this is

640
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,000
a good way to spread a particular

641
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
misinformation information because

642
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,320
if a trusted media share you

643
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
then you become a trusted source so

644
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559
people trust you and the

645
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,440
russian accountant

646
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
have tried to uh

647
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,320
to be become a trusted source in this

648
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,919
way

649
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,919
also trump uh for example has retweeted

650
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,240
a russian account that i don't remember

651
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
the username at the moment

652
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
i probably

653
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,959
thank god for something similar

654
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,279
so social media manipulation is

655
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,679
literally social engineering

656
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,880
because

657
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,480
they want that you trust them

658
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,799
and hacking

659
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,000
and the hack

660
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,159
mass media

661
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,279
usually is a good way

662
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,399
then there is also there are also german

663
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,399
twitter and uh

664
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,279
you can see that there is a spike

665
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,480
in uh

666
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,520
in

667
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,679
2017 uh during the federal election so

668
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,640
probably

669
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
uh some russian account

670
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,799
have tried to spread misinformation also

671
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,000
in germany

672
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,200
um that is probably uh that was them i

673
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
mean it is one of most important

674
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,080
european countries but

675
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
not with the same engagement not with

676
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,720
the same uh tweet volumas because uh

677
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,960
spread information uh despite this

678
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,880
information and the

679
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,600
lead information operation is expensive

680
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,240
and not easy

681
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,559
then it is interesting also to

682
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,080
see the uh

683
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,720
how the china government

684
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,360
has tried to spread this information and

685
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
propaganda on twitter

686
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
it is important considering that twitter

687
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
is blocked

688
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
in china

689
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,399
so probably

690
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,600
they

691
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
have tried to communicate with the expat

692
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,720
chinese people

693
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,039
there are two uh that means important

694
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,159
data set um reality or linked to the

695
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,720
chinese government by twitter

696
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,559
one was shared in august september um

697
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,080
2019 and one was shared in uh uh last

698
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
year

699
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,200
and uh it is interesting to see that for

700
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,360
uh the second data set twitter uh husked

701
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
the sort of help

702
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,919
to summon the independent

703
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,159
agency to investigate

704
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,360
the

705
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,479
chinese propaganda

706
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,520
the first data set is uh interesting

707
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,360
because there are a lot of theta more

708
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,840
than

709
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,760
30 millions

710
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,520
but

711
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,159
we have a big network of spam account

712
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,279
especially we can see that there are

713
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,000
a lot of indonesian tweets just jazpam

714
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,080
and the same for english tweet

715
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,399
and just unless one million tweets are

716
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,720
written in chinese

717
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,679
this is important to understand how

718
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,320
the chinese propaganda work

719
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
on twitter probably because twitter is

720
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
not so important for them probably

721
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
because they have of course a strong

722
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
internal uh propaganda

723
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,840
uh

724
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,200
but we can see that also um

725
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
twitter for twitter is not easy to

726
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
identify them

727
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,039
uh

728
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,799
we can see that uh

729
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,960
the there is a spike in the account

730
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
creation in the

731
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,200
in the 2019

732
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,440
so when there was uh

733
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,960
when there were the hong kong protest

734
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,440
but uh yeah

735
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,840
but we can see that a lot of accounts

736
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,720
are just spam account because there are

737
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,880
there are a lot of up and follow follow

738
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
for follow and similar um

739
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,320
similar hashtag uh this means that a lot

740
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,919
of these accounts

741
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,039
initially

742
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,399
um

743
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,799
were created just to spread spam

744
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,080
or

745
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,840
other

746
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,919
other uh yes or they are created to be

747
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,360
sold for example

748
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,039
and they be

749
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,120
these accounts

750
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,720
have been converted

751
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,039
to propaganda count only in the 2019.

752
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,399
hong kong process are the uh

753
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,279
main target of the chinese propaganda so

754
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,880
it's not topic

755
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,919
and they have tried to contrast they

756
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,559
have tied to uh spread another

757
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,879
storytelling about their protest

758
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,000
especially between october um

759
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,120
uh 2018 and july 2019

760
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,679
and the goal of course was

761
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,679
just spread an alternative narrative

762
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,880
about

763
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
this fact

764
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,960
it is interesting to uh

765
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,080
to see the daily rhythm because uh uh if

766
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,799
we check the daily rhythm of of all

767
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,320
twitter

768
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,799
shared in this data set we can see that

769
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,720
is a mess these are all

770
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,320
all uh

771
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
read in every day

772
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,600
uh in every moment uh if we check just

773
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
the tweet written in chinese we can see

774
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,120
a particular daily written we can see

775
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,360
that during the weekend the propaganda

776
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,440
account are

777
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,799
less active

778
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,639
and we can see that they spread

779
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,880
information in a particular time zone

780
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,120
the time zone is the

781
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,519
beijing time zone so they want

782
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,440
for some reason targets people in china

783
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,760
or probably they are written so they are

784
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
women that spread

785
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,480
information

786
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,880
that and this human are located in china

787
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,519
probably this is the

788
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
they call spread information from china

789
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,399
so uh for this reason uh twitter

790
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,039
probably uh

791
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,880
have classified this tweet and this

792
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
account uh

793
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,120
like uh uh

794
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,799
china propaganda

795
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
and um

796
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,559
it is important remember that uh you

797
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,159
cannot connect uh to twitter from from

798
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,800
china so uh for this reason twitter

799
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,960
classify uh this account has a

800
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,599
state linked

801
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,440
it is interesting to see that there are

802
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,520
some uh account in the data set

803
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,000
that twitter suspended in a first moment

804
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,280
but then

805
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
um

806
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,119
has been re-enabled by twitter probably

807
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,239
because

808
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,918
i cannot be sure because i haven't

809
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,520
information on the ip

810
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,359
but maybe they have

811
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,639
maybe they have used just a chinese vpn

812
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,839
and for the reason they

813
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,399
were misclassified as a propaganda

814
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,000
account

815
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,719
they were just some account related to

816
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,639
some spanish e-gamers

817
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,320
and it is interesting to see that

818
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,520
twitter

819
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,960
re-enable them and

820
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
it is another information this means

821
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,160
that twitter sometimes can

822
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
come wrong

823
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,560
this was the first chinese

824
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,599
chinese

825
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,160
data set shared by twitter then last

826
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
year twitter shared another one

827
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,079
and it is interesting see how

828
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,800
twitter has improved their ability to

829
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
identify

830
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
chinese

831
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
propaganda account

832
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
in particular they have written

833
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
more information in a blog post usually

834
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,359
twitter

835
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,920
doesn't share the meta methodology that

836
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,400
they have used to identify the counter

837
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,359
but this time for the second chinese

838
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,800
data set they have um shared more

839
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,359
information on their methodology

840
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,640
especially they have said that they um

841
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,119
that they ever shared the data set with

842
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,880
the two important uh independent agency

843
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,160
and they also have

844
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,680
written that

845
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,160
they have shared just the core accounts

846
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,400
not all the network and this is another

847
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,359
important information

848
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,560
we can see that in the new uh

849
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
in the core account sharing the second

850
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,440
data set the um

851
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,960
daily written is similar to the subset

852
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,240
of china chinese tweet in the first data

853
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,359
set so

854
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,400
no for the old tweet now we have a

855
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,680
well-defined time zone

856
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,000
and we can see also that now the

857
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,920
languages is uh

858
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,680
the

859
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,160
twit language is uh the main is chinese

860
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,480
not indonesia not english so they have

861
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,720
improved their ability to identify

862
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,079
probably a chinese propaganda account

863
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,440
and we can see that um

864
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,000
the main topic also for the second data

865
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
set uh

866
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,880
are the hong kong protests and

867
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
um

868
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,880
wengui that is a

869
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,640
chinese billionaire and political

870
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,839
dissident so um

871
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,400
the for example it is important to see

872
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
that also if the data set

873
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,040
was shared by twitter in june 2020 so

874
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,760
during the covered year copy is not the

875
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,560
main topic of this data set

876
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,119
but of course there are some uh tweets

877
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,079
related to copy of course

878
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,760
um

879
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
we can see that the account were created

880
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,160
between october uh

881
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,119
19 and march 20

882
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,680
saw before copied

883
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,320
and the main

884
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
topic the hashtag the most common ashtag

885
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,960
are related to protest and

886
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,720
the billionaire dissident

887
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,440
uh it is interesting to see that there

888
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
is a

889
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
big spike

890
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,440
in the

891
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,760
in the number of likes that the tweets

892
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
have generated uh between uh february

893
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,920
and march 20

894
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,040
and all accounts

895
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,320
have been uh

896
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,160
suspended by twitter in april 20.

897
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,480
it is interesting to see this uh big

898
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,280
spike in their hearts because uh this

899
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,160
means probably that the bots have

900
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,440
changed their strategy to spread

901
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,240
their tweets so they don't use

902
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,119
probably repeat to

903
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,880
increase the engagement but they use

904
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,640
like and reply

905
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,880
it is totally different from for example

906
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,160
the information operation led by the

907
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,440
internet research agency

908
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,680
in this data set we can find some tweet

909
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,520
written italian

910
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,560
and there are really interesting because

911
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
there are

912
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,760
81 tweets classified as italian but so

913
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,599
many are misclassified there are just

914
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,720
spam

915
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,520
but there are 25 tweets written italian

916
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
that are really interesting

917
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,400
they are uh already tweeted by the same

918
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,839
account

919
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
in action account so we have information

920
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,640
about their username or user id

921
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,520
and

922
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,320
they this account retweeted are not in

923
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,280
the data set so probably uh or are in

924
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,880
another uh

925
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,119
in the

926
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,160
amplifier account or twitter just don't

927
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
consider this account because the main

928
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,320
focus for the twitter engineers for the

929
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,760
twitter team

930
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,720
uh

931
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,760
where uh

932
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,720
the

933
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,960
twitter account related to hong kong

934
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,040
protest and the

935
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,000
chinese billionaire um

936
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,240
and the chinese billionaire so uh they

937
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,960
haven't really

938
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,760
tried to identify propaganda ready to

939
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,319
covet we can find some tweet to it to

940
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,960
cover the in the data set but this is

941
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,040
not the main focus of the dataset

942
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,319
we can see that these

943
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,440
25 tweets were repeated in the in three

944
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,760
distinct moments but in an automatic way

945
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,520
by an account created in february 2020

946
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,359
so uh

947
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,920
quite rightened account

948
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,520
um

949
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,800
these are the

950
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,520
all 25 tweets i don't know if you can

951
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,240
read them they are written in italian

952
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,599
in a

953
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,240
in a bad italian honestly and uh they

954
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,400
are

955
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,079
some tweets are the same tweet for

956
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,280
example and i have found a tweet there

957
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,040
are translated from english to italian

958
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,880
so the same fit but written in different

959
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,000
languages

960
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,920
and some picked containers linked to um

961
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,280
italian newspaper for example italian

962
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
mass media

963
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,839
and

964
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,640
they try to spread the

965
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
pro-chinese government

966
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,200
content so they try to

967
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,480
say that

968
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,680
kabida

969
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,919
was not treated to china and

970
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,280
because during the caviar unfortunately

971
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,520
there was a

972
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
we a sort of information war between the

973
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
united states

974
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,119
and china on the original the videos for

975
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,640
example

976
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,760
and

977
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,119
which are written in italia but they

978
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,520
contain but they contain a lot of a

979
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,920
grammatical mistake and so this means

980
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,240
probably that they are using they have

981
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,720
used the translator uh i mean uh

982
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,359
automatic translator to write them

983
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,880
but it is interesting because they've

984
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,400
tried to generate

985
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,319
content in italian

986
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,599
so uh

987
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,240
it is an interesting formation

988
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,480
all the 25 accounts

989
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,960
were created in march in

990
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,839
16 17

991
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,920
and 23 uh march

992
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,760
they sent

993
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,960
they tweeted in two moments so uh

994
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,160
in

995
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,440
23 and 26 march

996
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,440
in a very um well defined moment so

997
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,400
probably it is a coordinated operation

998
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,040
of course uh not authentic probably

999
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,000
using automated tool

1000
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,720
and all the accounts retreated so all

1001
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,760
these 25 accounts are now suspended by

1002
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,800
twitter

1003
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,280
so they are not in the core group

1004
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,400
but

1005
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,319
twitter decided to suspend them

1006
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,920
so the question is italy was a target of

1007
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,760
chinese propaganda

1008
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,280
well in the data set there are not

1009
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,599
enough data to answer to this question

1010
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,480
but

1011
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,079
the previous

1012
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,280
25 accounts 25 tweets show a

1013
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,119
coordinating authentic behavior and

1014
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,000
they

1015
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,560
they tweeted were written in italian so

1016
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,319
they have tried to generate original

1017
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,920
content just for

1018
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,680
italy

1019
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,839
and we can and we know that

1020
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,079
uh according to the previous chart we

1021
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,359
know that uh the ratio between retweet

1022
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,000
like is high for like

1023
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,319
um the account has have a low follower

1024
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,280
and

1025
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,160
they uh there are a lot of spam

1026
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
account of course

1027
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,800
uh

1028
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,760
and they tweet contain grammatical error

1029
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,640
i mean

1030
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,520
written

1031
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,079
italian contain grammatical error so we

1032
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,480
can try to use this label

1033
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,160
to find other similar accounts

1034
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,440
like this one

1035
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,000
we can see that this account have no

1036
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
peak for example

1037
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,680
they were created in march 2020 or in

1038
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,839
they are quite wretched like a counter

1039
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,920
they received a lot of like

1040
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,440
they shared a

1041
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,160
link to italian media

1042
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,359
but the twitter written in a bad italian

1043
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,240
uh

1044
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,359
and

1045
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,160
probably uh these accounts are related

1046
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,200
to uh chinese propaganda

1047
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,400
uh

1048
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,119
and they are still online because uh uh

1049
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,400
i suppose

1050
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,520
that uh the main target of

1051
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,480
the second that associated by twitter uh

1052
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,520
wasn't the propaganda ready to covet but

1053
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,480
uh

1054
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,640
was the propaganda related to hong kong

1055
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,440
protest and the um

1056
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
chinese dissident

1057
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,839
so what are the conclusion uh the

1058
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,839
conclusion are that

1059
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,319
it's not easy to measure the impact of

1060
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,240
an information operation and it is a

1061
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,000
problem

1062
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
because we can identify probably uh

1063
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,040
information operation on twitter oh i

1064
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,800
lose the slide sorry thank you

1065
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,520
but it's not easy to measure the

1066
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,000
propaganda effect or the propaganda

1067
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,880
impact

1068
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,960
especially some

1069
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,160
some researcher using the engagement

1070
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,960
but i don't like it especially

1071
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,760
because we can we can be sure that the

1072
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,839
also the engagement is not created by

1073
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,880
other bots for example we know that the

1074
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,520
high number of uh like that the previous

1075
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,400
account received is an artificial

1076
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,440
engagement generated by other bots

1077
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
uh it is more interesting for example

1078
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,400
see if some accounts are embedded or

1079
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,119
shared on trusted source like

1080
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,680
if for example verified account that

1081
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,800
repeated the um propaganda account or

1082
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,079
bought

1083
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,480
mainstream media that have embedded the

1084
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,920
tweet

1085
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,839
in their

1086
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,640
news or in their articles this is and

1087
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,440
probably for for me the most interested

1088
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,880
way to

1089
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,520
measure the engagement or the impact of

1090
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,760
information operation but it is not easy

1091
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,640
because it is not easy to identify

1092
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,880
all the tweets that

1093
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,880
were embedded by

1094
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,280
mainstream media in their web page

1095
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,520
target

1096
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,680
well journalist mainstream media

1097
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,319
politics usually are target of

1098
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,960
information operation we have seen

1099
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,839
these uh in a clear way in the internet

1100
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,319
research agency propaganda they have

1101
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,280
tried to uh become trusted

1102
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,880
um

1103
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,079
just

1104
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,960
interact with the

1105
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,640
american politics for example or

1106
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,400
mass medium

1107
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,760
and

1108
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,920
so it it is important um

1109
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,800
to verify uh the account

1110
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,960
don't trust to a particular twitter

1111
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,640
account just because it is popular

1112
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,400
because you don't know if the engagement

1113
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,160
is real or not

1114
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,680
um

1115
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,640
i don't embed the m verified tweet on my

1116
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
steam media it is important for legend

1117
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,119
for journalist decent point because uh

1118
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,359
yes i know that it is quite easy to take

1119
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,240
the popular tweets and embed them in an

1120
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,640
article but sometimes

1121
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,960
they they are popular just because there

1122
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,560
was a

1123
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,079
fake engagement

1124
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,280
or because

1125
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,839
they the the twitter became popular for

1126
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,400
random um

1127
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,280
just randomly and this means that it is

1128
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,640
important to check the account before a

1129
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,520
share it in a article

1130
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,599
because it when a

1131
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,240
propaganda account when a fake account

1132
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,200
is on a newspaper it became testable

1133
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,520
also for other and uh

1134
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,760
in this way the information operation

1135
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
can have an impact on

1136
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,319
on people and in the real life not just

1137
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,440
on twitter on other social media

1138
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,240
and i have finished sorry for my english

1139
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,040
i was a bit nervous

1140
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,520
