1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,439
because uh this is our first uh

2
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,480
international guest

3
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,960
[Music]

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
is a security researcher in the

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
operational technology with experience

6
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,440
in the plc forensic analysis protocol

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,039
reversing and anomaly detection

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,160
and

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
we will speak as we tell about tell us

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,079
about a long-range disruption of

11
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,199
industrial processes using drones and

12
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,960
lorawan

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
thank you so much janice the stage is

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,879
yours

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
thank you so much

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
right hello everyone

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
nice to be here

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
i'm jan stavro i'm doing bernabeu risk

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,720
analysis in new zealand networks

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
and in this presentation we are going to

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,040
discuss a bit about lorawan so what we

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
wanted to do was to

23
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,119
understand how we can

24
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,200
rethink the challenging of this protocol

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,439
in the industrial format

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,400
and we think that uh

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,759
while there's a lot of advance in this

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,600
technology there's still a lot of nice

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,039
ways to disrupt it so let's get started

30
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
so a bit about

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
laura laura one is

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
categorized under the

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
low power wide area networks

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
this is a kind of technologies that are

35
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,360
focused on

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
long-range communication uh with low

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
power consumption

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,960
this makes a lot of sense in the context

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
of

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
remote sensors that do not have a lot of

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,760
juice to to cooperate

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
but you still need to have some kind of

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
connectivity to work with them

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
there are other similar technologies

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,319
like sigfox and nbt and ltm and those

46
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
are

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
very similar to laura they have

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
different characteristics

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
but overall all those come to solve

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
the same problem

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
among the other benefits one of uh

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
important one is the low subscription

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
costs so basically uh if you have a 40

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,959
cheap it's very expensive to use the

55
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,000
bandwidth

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,440
uh lora solves this problem quite easily

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,040
so the market is growing uh this slide

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
is a bit old uh but

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
more and more we can see that this

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
technology is used all around the world

61
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
to solve a number of problems

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
um

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
the asia pacific is the biggest adopter

64
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
in this technology

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,519
and

66
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,400
the

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
industry that

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
seems to be more fitting is utilities

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
like you can think like

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
um the

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
gas

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,239
gas meters or water meters in the houses

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,640
have have to be accessed by individual

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,239
to see the values

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,040
now we can change uh these meters uh

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
with this radio technology and be able

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,799
to receive these values uh quite easily

78
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,200
so for this industries uh this is quite

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,679
appealing

80
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,680
so to discuss a bit about some

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
applications that are out there in the

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,959
wild uh

83
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,200
for example in japan

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
misguided is using sick fox and they are

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
changing about eight hundred five

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,120
thousand

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
meters

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
and in germany the shell is using 250

89
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
hundred thousand roll cages

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,799
uh in france they're using uh operators

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
from uh for laura for smart meters

92
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,360
uh in brazil they're using it into max

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
trucks over 1 million trucks are

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
retrofitted with

95
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
lora sensors

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,959
in china they're using nbiot for

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
electric bikes and

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
in sweden they are using it for smart

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
estimators

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,280
overall you'll see that

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
basically these sensors are used to

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,800
locate moving assets like vehicles or as

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,320
we said

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
to measure

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
stationary sensors that are

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
basically large in numbers so the cost

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,758
to access them is quite high

108
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
so as we said the

109
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
lorawan is in the

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,680
in the

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
lora power wide range category uh the

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
main

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,039
point of the design is to be operated by

114
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,880
a battery system so it basically can

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,039
assume very little power

116
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,000
and there is the caveat here that the

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
rate of data that can be

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
communicated is very low uh but

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,039
in a sense this is not a problem because

120
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
this is applications

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
where you have to communicate this

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
information uh very rarely so let's say

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
if you do a measurement for a gas meter

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
you don't have to do it every second

125
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
but a few measurements per day or within

126
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
the week are more enough to communicate

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
what exactly you need

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
the main features uh that technology you

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,759
target to solve when it was installed

130
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,039
was to

131
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
provide bi-directional communication so

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
you are able to communicate with the

133
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
sensor and sensor back to you

134
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,639
although this configuration can be

135
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
adjusted according to your needs

136
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
you can skip one of those communication

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
channels so the sensor can communicate

138
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,680
onto you

139
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
to save battery

140
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
it was really important for them to

141
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
provide end-to-end security so there is

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
an authentication mechanism with a lot

143
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,400
of devices so you can set it up

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,600
with proper encryption so i know and no

145
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
one can just drop the communication and

146
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
understand this values

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
and of course

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
to solve the main problem we have to

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
provide mobility and localization

150
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
services

151
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
a bit about the architecture the

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
architecture is

153
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,199
fairly simple you have devices that have

154
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
the lower chip or

155
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
for other technology similar chips

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,639
and the point is that there is a special

157
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,080
gateway that can receive those packets

158
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
and the job of the gateway is modulate

159
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
and you modulate the specific signal to

160
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
these devices so basically you got less

161
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,960
than whatever you want you have to have

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,599
the gateway and from the gateway

163
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,120
everything else is conventional id so

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,639
you can have whatever technology you

165
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,599
need

166
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,639
the last point the endpoint from the

167
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
service side is an application server

168
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
the job of the application server is to

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
the decryption part of the information

170
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,479
and also to pass the data and provide

171
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,240
them as a service so between the devices

172
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
and the application there is no way to

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
identify the information the gateway

174
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,479
just does

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,560
a part of the checking of the

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
multi-modulation like a crc check or

177
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
something like that but the main thing

178
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
is that um this is the security that

179
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,039
we're talking about there is no way to

180
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,000
use these traffic

181
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
so what we wanted to do here we we know

182
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
that uh these sensors are appealing also

183
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
in other projects

184
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
for example

185
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,919
we

186
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,440
know for a project that is a gas

187
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
pipeline that

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,840
is distributing gas in very long

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
distances

190
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,919
and in this scenario what's happened is

191
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,360
that you want to have some kind of

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
data be communicated between

193
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,759
you and this

194
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
gas pipeline so

195
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,800
they the setup didn't have any critical

196
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,360
data because lora is not

197
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,479
used for

198
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,919
time critical information but it was for

199
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,279
weather data or localization data or

200
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
information that were supportive to the

201
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
whole operation

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
so

203
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,959
what we wanted to do here is try to

204
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,399
disrupt this and and try to understand

205
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,000
how we can

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,440
break the protocol

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
in a way that this information will not

208
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,560
be available to the stakeholder

209
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
and we wanted mainly to focus on the

210
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,399
practicality how how possible it is

211
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
without

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,640
without breaking the world how possible

213
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
it is to make this information

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,199
unavailable to the interesting parties

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,920
so what we focused on was basically

216
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
two two strategies the main

217
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
first part is to be able to find the

218
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
sensors so

219
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
that was important because

220
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
because we were talking about radio

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
signals it was

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
crucial for us to be able to understand

223
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,480
exactly where are these sensors

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,839
located

225
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,720
and

226
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,200
how we can detect them

227
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,279
if you have a pipeline uh the

228
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
measurement that if i recollect was

229
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
about two to three kilometers per sensor

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
so you can imagine that uh it's

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
difficult to

232
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,040
pinpoint exactly where the sensors are

233
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
if you do not have a mechanism to find

234
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,399
them

235
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,720
and so that is the best first part that

236
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
we focused on and the second part was to

237
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
disrupt it to be able to

238
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
make so that the sensor will not be able

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,519
or at least

240
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
its signal will not be able to be

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,519
demodulated by

242
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,120
the gateway

243
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
the point is here simply to just drop

244
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
the packet

245
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,600
not impersonate it and not replay any

246
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
information

247
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
so for this project we focused a bit on

248
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
the equipment and we wanted to do

249
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
something fairly cheap we didn't want to

250
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
invest a lot of

251
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,959
resources uh of course if you are able

252
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
to do it you can expand this process in

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
a lot of ways

254
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
what we just used basically out of the

255
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,399
self products

256
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,440
we use and sdr like a rf basically it's

257
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
a module that you can

258
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
program it as you wish to demodulate and

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,800
modulate any protocol including laura so

260
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
basically you can do that and you can

261
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,279
tickle part of the

262
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
demodulation so that you can be able to

263
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
send

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
non-compliant packets

265
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,880
the idea here was to be able to receive

266
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
and to set packets

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,279
at the same time we use these they are

268
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,040
in this context

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,160
for the disruption part because uh the

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,560
complexity of the programming here could

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,279
not be done with just a simple

272
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
lora chip so we could take a chip and

273
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,839
try to program it to do the stuff we

274
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
wanted but

275
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
the context here was to be able to do

276
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,440
more than that so we needed to have such

277
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
a device

278
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
for the localization part for the

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
gateway used an arduino it was fairly

280
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
simple to program such a way

281
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
the goal of this device was just to be

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
able to receive data

283
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,079
and try to calculate to measure to give

284
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
us information after where the sensor is

285
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
and that was also a critical part of

286
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
this process because we wanted to be as

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
close to the sensor as possible to

288
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,000
try to exploit the operation

289
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,399
so

290
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,920
the localization basically um

291
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,839
is focusing on uh

292
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,880
basic physics here its laura is emitting

293
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
a signal to be able to communicate with

294
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,560
a gateway and that of itself is

295
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
communicating some information um

296
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
even if the signal is encrypted we can

297
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
derive a few stuff

298
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
one of the stuff that we can derive is

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
the power of the signal how strong or

300
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,200
how weak is another thing is the timing

301
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,079
when the signal is triggered

302
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
all this stuff is information for us

303
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,040
that we can use to understand

304
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
what is the possible location

305
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
of the signal in this context we use the

306
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
power of the signal to be able to

307
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,440
estimate the distance of the sensor so

308
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,639
in a sense

309
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,920
we make

310
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
an assumption as to as to where it is

311
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
given that the provided the signal

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
received from the sensor

313
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
and the metric we used for that is the

314
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,839
rssi which is the received single

315
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
strength indicator this is a value

316
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
provided but by many other

317
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
signals like the wi-fi

318
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
so

319
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
the exercise basically

320
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,079
a measurement of the power of the signal

321
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
it it is used to indicate how good or

322
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,040
bad is a wireless connection

323
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,160
and it's received in what's measured by

324
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
decimals per meter and the point here is

325
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,839
that

326
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,800
we

327
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
we can use this information

328
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
to get an estimation

329
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,680
of uh

330
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,760
how close or far away is the sensor

331
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,839
for laura there is a range from 120 to

332
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,480
zero zero is the strongest possible

333
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
value

334
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,639
so

335
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
this is enough to give us some

336
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
information about that

337
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
the issue that we got here is that the

338
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,920
accuracy is not great because this

339
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
signal is easily disturbed as we will

340
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,399
see by a lot of factors in environmental

341
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,920
factors

342
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
but uh

343
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,279
in in this context of two and three

344
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,519
kilometers of distances we do not need

345
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,519
actually to be like one meter next to

346
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
the sensor we have to be

347
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
maybe a few hundred meters

348
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,519
that will be more than enough to

349
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,680
initiate the next stage so

350
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,880
there are other ways to to do this

351
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
technique to localize it without using

352
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
the receiving constructor that would be

353
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
um

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,040
timing

355
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
calculations but they require

356
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,959
more

357
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,440
more equipment and more complex

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
algorithms so

359
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,639
in this context we wanted to keep it as

360
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,600
simple as possible

361
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,480
so the rssi

362
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,079
basically

363
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,560
can be provided by a mathematical

364
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
formula

365
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
and this is the formula shown here uh

366
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,079
basically

367
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,160
this formula gives you the distance

368
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,639
compared to ssi

369
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,279
and with two and it's uh

370
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,839
and it's measured with two other unknown

371
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,639
variables that be a which is

372
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,440
the received power that will be given by

373
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,079
the sensor in one meter and the other is

374
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
n which is the loss parameter or lost

375
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,199
exponent

376
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,800
which depends on the environmental

377
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,079
conditions

378
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,279
now for the same chip a is going to be

379
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,560
more or less

380
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
stable the problem is n that is

381
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,120
how the n fluctuates according to the

382
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
environment

383
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
and we got a lot of problems with this

384
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,399
parameter because

385
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,519
the

386
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
it's very different if you have the

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
sensor in a building uh in an urban or

388
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,519
in a suburban area

389
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
so it's it's

390
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
it wasn't the most convenient formula to

391
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
use

392
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
but under specific conditions you can

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
make a few assumptions about it like if

394
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,040
it's in the urban area and under

395
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
specific

396
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
terrain conditions

397
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
you will get

398
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
more or less

399
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
accurate enough values to give us issues

400
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,680
that we like so this technique will not

401
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,880
work

402
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
probably at all in a closed space or if

403
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,839
there's a lot of buildings or if you're

404
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,880
not in a proper elevated position

405
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,519
but for this context remember pipelines

406
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,040
long distances

407
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,680
open areas this is more than enough

408
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
for our experiments we calculated some

409
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
values these values are calculated after

410
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
experimenting different distance areas

411
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,320
using an outdoor environment these are

412
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
approximations they will not work out of

413
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,959
the box for every configuration and they

414
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
are highly

415
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
tied with a chipset that is used in

416
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,520
laura

417
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
but the experiments show that you can

418
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
make

419
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
good estimations about what is the

420
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,160
possible value that can be given here

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,559
so the the point is now that if you

422
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,079
imagine if you get one measurement out

423
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,559
of nowhere assume you get the distance

424
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,200
from this mathematical problem and this

425
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
is not enough because basically you are

426
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
placed in a point in space and then

427
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
suddenly you get a signal from somewhere

428
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,080
and you derive that okay this signal is

429
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,160
about half a kilometer away from me the

430
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,679
problem is you don't know where okay

431
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
it's a direction in a circle around you

432
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,240
that you can understand exactly which is

433
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,440
the location

434
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
so the solution here is a

435
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
simple geometric problem you have to use

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,200
a translocation algorithm which is

437
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
basically

438
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,520
a geometric technique to find all the

439
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,039
points given that you have a measurement

440
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,840
for this ankle so what you have to do is

441
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,799
to make multiple measurements

442
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,760
and in theory if you make three of them

443
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,400
in different locations and you have

444
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
three these three different

445
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,120
measurement points for the same sensor

446
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
you can more or less um calculate where

447
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
it's coming from because

448
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,919
all these points

449
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,039
we

450
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,039
all these points if are considered to be

451
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,720
the center for circle

452
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,679
will have one common uh dissection so

453
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,080
they're gonna connect in one common

454
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,120
point

455
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,280
and this is the point where the sensor

456
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,960
will be placed

457
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
even if there is some deviation in the

458
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
erroring of the calculation it's going

459
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,160
to be in an area close to this point of

460
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,280
measurement

461
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,960
as more as measurements you can make the

462
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
average calculation is going to be more

463
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,080
accurate if you can take 10 or 15 no one

464
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,960
is

465
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,600
blocking you to make as much as you want

466
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,480
so

467
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
in in a graph repetition this house

468
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
looks and it's very simple you're gonna

469
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,559
do the measurements in point cell one

470
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,640
two three every point is gonna give you

471
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
a distance and then to the point of the

472
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,919
section is gonna be when the location of

473
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,240
the sensor

474
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,360
is

475
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,440
um again the problem here is that if d1

476
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,559
b2 and d3 are not accurate because the

477
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,480
formula was not correct or something is

478
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,799
off you're going to have a miss approach

479
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,760
in where exactly these points connect if

480
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
they connect because they can be smaller

481
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
and there are no connections at all uh

482
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,840
again we solve this problem by making

483
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
multiple uh

484
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,080
measurements

485
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,280
so we tried this uh in general we we

486
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
went to the outskirts and we tried to do

487
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
the calculation of the cfps coordinates

488
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
and we tried to use the

489
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,600
suburban area

490
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
and the urban area the urban area had

491
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
not worked very well but in the super

492
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
area we have good results uh basically

493
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,799
here we saw

494
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,960
the three measurements when we take

495
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,760
and

496
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
the accuracy was

497
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
more or less to the point so we were

498
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
able to locate that the sensor is

499
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,919
displaced

500
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
and we just moved around these locations

501
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
and we make the measurement multiple

502
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,919
times in the same spot to be sure that

503
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,640
the value for each distance that we get

504
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
was

505
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,880
as accurate as as possible again it's

506
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
important to mention that this will not

507
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,520
work uh did not work very well when

508
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
we're in the city or if we were in a

509
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,919
closed spaces

510
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
so good if you if you do calculations

511
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
you can locate the sensor so the next

512
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
stage is to be able to interrupt the

513
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,520
signal and

514
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,480
the the rationale here is to lead the

515
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,559
gateway to with those states so what we

516
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,679
want to do is what we want to send

517
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
a specific signal that is going to block

518
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,760
the gateway from receiving the

519
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
legitimate signal coming from the sensor

520
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,039
and so the message will be lost so the

521
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
idea here is just to do a common dos

522
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,320
state attack

523
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
the problem that we have with classic

524
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,840
radio jammers

525
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,039
is that

526
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,600
we thought about okay you can go there

527
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,840
and you can open the switch and you can

528
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
just start jamming the thing out

529
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,120
but they are quite noisy and they

530
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,600
disrupt everything in the vehicle that's

531
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,159
in the same frequency so basically we

532
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,200
didn't like it because they are

533
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
controllably disruptive

534
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
and they they have a lot of noise so

535
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,159
they are detectable so can someone can

536
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,720
easily follow back to you

537
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,520
and there's another problem that laura

538
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,120
is basically using a technique to hop

539
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,440
frequency so it's not going to send a

540
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
packet in specific channel

541
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,360
but it will deviate according to the

542
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,919
implementation in absolute random way

543
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,440
and in the eq bandwidth of lora they

544
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,320
have 10 channels so basically if you're

545
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
lucky you can

546
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
disrupt only one of them so that would

547
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
be

548
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
um with the probability cutting one

549
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
packet per

550
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
one packet per 10 packets that we that

551
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,919
the

552
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,400
gateway drops and we really didn't like

553
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
this kind of also we want to improve a

554
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
bit our approach here

555
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,640
so we we did something kind of more

556
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
selective

557
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,919
what we tried to do was basically the

558
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,120
following we try to activate the charmer

559
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,559
only when

560
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,480
the reception of

561
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
the packet is going to happen

562
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
so one thing about these sensors is that

563
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
is that usually they are having a

564
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
predictable pattern as to when they set

565
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
the packet so they're gonna set it every

566
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
let's say a couple of hours or every

567
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
couple of days so

568
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,760
usually this time

569
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,919
timetable is

570
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,799
very very specific so one thing that you

571
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,440
can do is you can activate the sensor

572
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
when the packet is leaving or deactivate

573
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
it uh when

574
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,960
when it's not be used

575
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,559
and the other thing that you can do

576
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,280
about the channels is that you can

577
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
create multiple configurations of the

578
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,679
same jammers so basically you can put

579
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,840
10 filters that are gonna look up to all

580
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,039
the channels in the lower frequency and

581
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
you can activate them all at the same

582
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
time with the same

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
rationale

584
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
the

585
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
the other approach that we investigated

586
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,919
and implemented here was actually not to

587
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,559
time the lower packets

588
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,080
but basically

589
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,400
wait for the packet to be sent by the

590
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
sensor and the moment that the packet is

591
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,320
transmitted immediately we send a our

592
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
jamming packet

593
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,840
so basically we wait for the

594
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
for the sensor to start communicating by

595
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
its own and when we detect this

596
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,640
interaction then we send the signal

597
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,360
and our signal is basically just a

598
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,919
burst of energy so it's it's a high

599
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,880
power signal in the same frequency in

600
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,559
the same

601
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
modulation that what it's going to do is

602
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,679
going to disrupt the the legitimate

603
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,200
message

604
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,039
what this creates

605
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,919
is

606
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,159
is basically from the whole information

607
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,600
that's communicated

608
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
part of the packet

609
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,640
is lost

610
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
part of the packet is destroyed in the

611
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,919
process

612
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,200
and

613
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
this results in involving the crc of the

614
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,360
packet

615
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
so

616
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
what we managed to do in our lab is that

617
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
every time a packet was sent we will do

618
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
that and the server the application

619
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
server that we mentioned before

620
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,200
will not receive the packet at all only

621
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
if you receive the packet he would

622
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,919
complain that the crc was false from the

623
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,120
gateway and you will drop the packet so

624
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,080
in a sense we were able to do that in a

625
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
in a

626
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
very simple classic way but we just did

627
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,000
the extra step of trying to activate

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
this the jamming as less as possible so

629
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,559
so that is not

630
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,600
visible to any defense features

631
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,679
a bit about the implementation

632
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
everything was done in python using new

633
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
radio

634
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,279
in the sdr we

635
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
we had a few problems with that because

636
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
python is slow so this kind of

637
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
techniques and modulations

638
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
have

639
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
some performance

640
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,880
they they have a lot of performance

641
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,080
demands

642
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
for the project was was very good it was

643
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
surprisingly very effective and much

644
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
simple to do

645
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,080
but it would be much better if we if you

646
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,559
upgrade this implementation to sc kind

647
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,360
of style but for this implementation

648
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,080
python can work very well

649
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
and here is what we will see from the

650
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
guru radio is like

651
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,760
when the

652
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,279
lower packet starts you can see in the

653
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
first screenshot uh the signal is

654
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,559
captured by a detection system at the uh

655
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,440
of our detection of the sdr and then

656
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
what you see in the picture below is

657
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
what happens when we send the burst of

658
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,559
energy so

659
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,880
basically at this point information has

660
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
been

661
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,919
distorted

662
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,799
you even if you change a few bytes

663
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
or the or a few bits from the whole

664
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,080
transmission

665
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
the crc is going to fail so you don't

666
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
have to do a lot of stuff

667
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,799
to actually block the signal

668
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,200
so that seems to be quite effective way

669
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
to go on with it

670
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,440
so the

671
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,760
the final problem that we have was okay

672
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
we were interested to see how this is

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
going to play out but we really wanted

674
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,799
to see how realistic is this in the in

675
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,960
the real world and

676
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,520
having to see how we're going to execute

677
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
it in a pragmatic way a thing is that

678
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,279
for these distances to do it actually

679
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,240
uh there is a lot of

680
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,559
overheads you have to move long

681
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
distances so probably you need a car you

682
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,360
have to go around you have to stay there

683
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
for hours to do these measurements

684
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,039
so

685
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,200
we we thought that um this is not

686
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
probably that's can be executed in in a

687
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
fast pace if you want to do this kind of

688
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,200
analysis and we thought that

689
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
maybe it's better to

690
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,399
to go with something more elaborate

691
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
another thing

692
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,080
is that

693
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,679
the those limitations um have other we

694
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,279
have other limitations that have to do

695
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,600
with the terrain so basically

696
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
if you are behind the hill or if you

697
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
have a lot of trees or if there are

698
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
buildings in front of you

699
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,640
all these measurements for the distance

700
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,720
for example would be problematic and

701
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,120
recycled so have to think about that

702
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,159
so

703
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,480
as we moved on with the

704
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
terrain problem and the

705
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
the selected jumping approach

706
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,240
we consider these factors and we

707
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,399
understood that

708
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,880
a good way to solve the terrain problem

709
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,000
is to be elevated so we have to be

710
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,679
either in a high terrain or high

711
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,880
elevation

712
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,440
to understand to have a better reception

713
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,600
of the signal and also have the most

714
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,720
clear

715
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,480
reception of the signal because of all

716
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,159
the interactions that single might have

717
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
with terrain

718
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,840
and uh also be

719
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
better for us to have to be more

720
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,480
effective in our jammer because

721
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,559
the jamming module has to be

722
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
relatively close to the sensor to be

723
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,360
successful

724
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,640
so to do that we just uh thought okay

725
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,440
why would you use drones drones are fun

726
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,399
and they are easily controllable and

727
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,360
they are cheap right now they have

728
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,399
they

729
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,799
start to becoming better and better

730
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,480
in battery

731
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,120
consumption etc so we thought that if

732
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
you are elevated in a low 20 or 30

733
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,679
meters in altitude

734
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,880
away from

735
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,360
any disreferences you can easily make

736
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,600
these measurements well easily you can

737
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
make this measurement with not a lot of

738
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,799
miss accuracies

739
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,679
so

740
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,799
we observed this difference in ground

741
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,279
elevation and that in the ground

742
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,720
basically we will get a lot of

743
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,919
fluctuations uh but in

744
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,320
in the rain we will get more static

745
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,440
values

746
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
of the rssi

747
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,559
so that was

748
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,960
for us a good solution and it seems like

749
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,679
uh drones are very good to travel easily

750
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,760
these distances if they have a lot of

751
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
power of course

752
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,440
and we thought that that might be a nice

753
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
way to actually make this approach

754
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
pragmatic

755
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,159
so

756
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
here the the

757
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,200
rationale was very simple we just take

758
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,279
the drone we

759
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,600
select the location close the facility

760
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,919
and we say here that could be a 10

761
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,600
kilometer radius but

762
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,480
we're more or less guessing about

763
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,679
three to four kilometers around the area

764
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,159
and at this point what we do is that we

765
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,320
will uh activate the drone

766
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,360
take altitude and try to make a

767
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,320
measurement for the rssi

768
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,440
uh and here we we did this very simple

769
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
with just an

770
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,919
raspberry battery and some wi-fi

771
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,840
connectivity with a mobile phone so

772
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,760
we're able to get these uh values from

773
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,039
with this method

774
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,480
and the measurements that we have to

775
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
take for the ssi have to be a lot so

776
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
with four or five per location just to

777
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
be sure

778
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,919
405 is a is another game here but in

779
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,000
another location we took 10 times that

780
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,720
number so we want to create an average

781
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,519
between those values per location

782
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,919
after that you have to move to two more

783
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,080
locations and that is to create the

784
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,960
circle pattern that we described before

785
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
of course

786
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,159
you can make more you can make five six

787
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,240
or ten or whatever is available under

788
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,720
your resources and all this information

789
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
gonna guide you to

790
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,039
make them make the correct measurement

791
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,200
for the lora sensor after all this

792
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,120
process we calculate the location of the

793
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,080
sensor so that could be on average

794
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,799
uh

795
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,120
in a few hundred meters far away from

796
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
the sensor which is fine it's more than

797
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,159
enough for us

798
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,039
and then we we will move close to it to

799
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,480
try to exploit it

800
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
so yeah the approach

801
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,080
sense is the next step that we approach

802
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,120
the sensor and we try to activate the

803
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,320
jamming attack uh at this point we will

804
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
just put

805
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
the clone to the ground

806
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,799
and we will we

807
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,720
in our friend just let in the ground but

808
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
what you have to do is to just levitate

809
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,880
it again and then have the best single

810
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,919
reception and then we do the trick when

811
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,760
the packet will be emitted by the sensor

812
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,559
we will instantly send a jammy single

813
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,919
back into it

814
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,440
so that we can make sure that the

815
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,039
perception will not be received

816
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
so i have a video for you

817
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,679
which is how

818
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,840
we executed this

819
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,279
it's like

820
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,960
this is in the outskirts of uh genova

821
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
so basically

822
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,720
we wrapped up inside the drone the

823
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,440
gateway we had a lot of troubles with

824
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
the weight for this guy because these

825
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,799
guys cannot take a lot of weight

826
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,640
but it's because this is not one of the

827
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,960
most expensive ones if you get the high

828
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
end or drone you can definitely put a

829
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,679
lot of equipment on it

830
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,960
so

831
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,600
at this point uh we are moving the

832
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,559
sensor to a specific location uh the

833
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,640
drone to a specific location this is

834
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
coming from a pilot so we are not

835
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,919
allowed to fly these things without an

836
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,600
authorized guy

837
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,559
but

838
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,840
it all

839
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
everything could be automated if you

840
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,960
have the license or not anyway to do so

841
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,919
so the the pilot was not a necessity

842
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,919
just for legalities you have to

843
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,279
have someone authorized to fly the thing

844
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,360
uh the measurements uh where

845
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,679
in these three locations that you see in

846
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,960
the map basically we knew that the

847
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,880
the sensor is in the red spot and we

848
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,039
have these three points

849
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
and now the green spot is where we take

850
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,360
the first measurement so it's fairly

851
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
close to the sensor but the point here

852
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,240
was to understand even if this

853
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
value was

854
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,679
was good enough

855
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,120
so the

856
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,719
we tried to elevate it in different

857
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,280
attitudes to see the measurement that we

858
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,399
that we've got how good or bad will be

859
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,280
these values we seems to be that for the

860
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,359
specific limitations that drone had we

861
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,839
get on average goodbyes on the 20 meter

862
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,119
range

863
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,560
and

864
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,960
hard work is that we will get these rssi

865
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,359
values from a measuring point you could

866
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,359
see that there are fluctuations

867
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,520
at some point in the first measurement

868
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,079
button then stabilizes to another to

869
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,520
another value

870
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,560
and what we do is that we will put this

871
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
for

872
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,560
a lot of values to create an average

873
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,440
perspective or or what to be the correct

874
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,960
rsi value

875
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,199
what we have also is the latitude and

876
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,079
longitude using gps you you we can use

877
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,760
that also to

878
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
to understand where is the the drone

879
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
and then what we will do is

880
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,880
we will go to

881
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,680
the

882
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,000
next location so

883
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,480
the point here is that this drone

884
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,359
was

885
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,240
be able to fly for 20 minutes so it's

886
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
not something that we can use for actual

887
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,480
lock distances

888
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,400
but all those are limitations of

889
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
resources and nothing more so if you

890
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,880
have

891
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,440
more powerful devices you can easily do

892
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
these measurements

893
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,640
for long long distances

894
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,000
one of the problems that we

895
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,599
find out uh in the second location is

896
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,880
that if you have a mountainous terrain

897
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,760
very close to you and you don't go above

898
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,359
it you will get

899
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,640
completely

900
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,200
distracted values so you have to place

901
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,359
it a bit strategically in the air

902
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,200
and then the drone moved to the final

903
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,400
location which was uh the third point in

904
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,880
the in the map um for for us

905
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
in this scenario

906
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,920
three locations were enough uh the the

907
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,000
approximation here

908
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,040
was

909
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
about a hundred meters

910
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,240
in the in the proximity of the sensor so

911
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,720
was that was more than enough to

912
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,359
consider it as a success

913
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,119
but as we said this kind of

914
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,560
calculation

915
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,640
will be vastly different if you try to

916
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,760
do this

917
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,040
uh in

918
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
in a more complicated area like if you

919
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,760
do it in the city uh basically because

920
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,280
there's a lot of disruptions there etc

921
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,560
um

922
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,720
so at this point the drone

923
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
presumably has located the sensor and

924
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
now it's going to try to

925
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
disrupt it to jump it

926
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,560
and

927
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,720
how we'll do this is that we will wait

928
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,160
the signal

929
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,040
and

930
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
then we're gonna send the burst of

931
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,599
energy that's going to

932
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
disrupt the process

933
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,160
so basically uh what happened in this

934
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,960
experiment was that the csc was

935
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,520
corrupted so the signal actually reads

936
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,079
the application server but it could not

937
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,280
be

938
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,040
used by the server so it was dropped out

939
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
and was thrown away

940
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,320
and

941
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,480
importantly in this scenario the

942
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,320
disruption lasts five seconds so we we

943
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
just click on the

944
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
the jammer for five seconds every time

945
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
this jumping has to happen and then we

946
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
switch it off

947
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
and

948
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,640
as i said the the the channel hopping

949
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,920
was tackled by using multiple modules of

950
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,200
the same feature

951
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,480
okay so overall

952
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,800
we are happy with these results we think

953
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
that uh this application um was fairly

954
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,839
easy to follow up because it didn't take

955
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,359
a lot of resources on a lot of

956
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,560
expensive equipment to pull it off the

957
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,400
the main thing that we think is the next

958
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,720
step is to just use something more uh

959
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,359
quality for the localization um we're

960
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,880
thinking to move all the time difference

961
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,240
of arrival

962
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,520
and

963
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,359
the main limitations that we have was

964
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,800
basically

965
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
the drone so the drone was

966
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,240
couldn't lift the weight so

967
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,040
if i remember collecting was like 1.5

968
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,599
kilograms the full equipment and the

969
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,680
drone could do less than one so we have

970
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,839
to do a lot of tricks to be able to pull

971
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,119
this off

972
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,640
uh but

973
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,240
a good drone that can lift this kind of

974
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,480
stuff is on the 5k range so it's

975
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,960
basically is how much resources you can

976
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,560
put into

977
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,960
this issue and the other limitation was

978
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
legalities to flight basically you have

979
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,400
to be

980
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
outside the city in a remote area with

981
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
an authorized pilot

982
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,000
and of course those limitations um

983
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
do not concern an apt

984
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,200
or any other

985
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,160
other productors

986
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,000
so the point of um

987
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
of this

988
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
of this talk is that

989
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,480
we

990
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
we see we see that uh there is a lot of

991
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,680
advances in um

992
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,880
in these technologies in laura and the

993
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,760
iot world and we see that there is a

994
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,000
desire also to try to break them so

995
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,640
there's a lot of ways to do that

996
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,520
but

997
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,440
as we move on we can see that

998
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,359
those are the things that they have on

999
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,160
these distances or whatever we have to

1000
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
do to do that

1001
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,040
or how much time do we need to

1002
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,240
to

1003
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,960
to waste on locating the sensors

1004
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
um slowly can be changed if you use the

1005
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,680
correct technology and here uh drones

1006
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,640
were

1007
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,040
a good way to solve very pragmatic

1008
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,520
problems like how to reach a sensor how

1009
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,599
to use techniques to locate them

1010
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,160
efficiently in a fast way

1011
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,800
and this highlights that uh

1012
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,599
slowly you have to consider the physical

1013
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,839
original security of your equipment like

1014
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,079
uh okay so you know it's not like a

1015
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,319
drone will fly to you with a bomb but it

1016
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,599
can be

1017
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,760
like a fly close to you disrupts you and

1018
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,480
then go away and you have no idea what

1019
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,440
happened

1020
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,200
so we think those are issues that maybe

1021
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
the industry should have a look around

1022
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,800
in the following years

1023
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,720
and that was that was my talk thank you

1024
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,879
very much

1025
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,440
thank you thank you so much janice

1026
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,800
thank you so much it was very

1027
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,920
interesting so we just have a one quick

1028
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,350
question

1029
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,520
[Music]

1030
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,480
which

1031
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,119
which is uh if you have read in the news

1032
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,079
of any

1033
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,480
attack not exactly like the one that you

1034
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,880
described but attacks

1035
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,640
performed uh

1036
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,920
by the use of drones

1037
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,319
so um

1038
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,000
as we look at this project i would say

1039
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,480
the answer for now is no as far as we

1040
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,119
know at least

1041
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,680
what we know is that they have been used

1042
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,560
for restaurants for military purposes

1043
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,680
and other reasons but

1044
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,319
i haven't seen someone weaponizing the

1045
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,040
drone with its armor or stuff like that

1046
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,680
and actually using in the real field

1047
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,119
um

1048
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,800
the reason why we

1049
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,839
we

1050
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,560
mess with drones was because they can

1051
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,920
easily reach

1052
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,400
utility locations like

1053
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,599
power grids or other infrastructures

1054
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,480
and

1055
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,880
is considered by we already have these

1056
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,680
limitations or defense mechanisms like

1057
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,280
guest drones like they cannot fly close

1058
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
to the airports so the

1059
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,200
is standing in

1060
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,400
slowly is a bit concerned as to

1061
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,160
what will happen if a drone reaches my

1062
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,800
infrastructure what it can cut a cable

1063
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,280
or if if you can do stuff

1064
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
even in this scenario the idea was okay

1065
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,599
it can just have an antenna and create

1066
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,200
problems to you

1067
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,319
but

1068
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,119
there is no an event that

1069
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,280
is validated by the by the industry that

1070
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,839
i know of

1071
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,760
okay okay thank you so much again janis

1072
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,200
thank you so much

1073
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,520
thank you have a nice day
