[Applause]

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,020
Two and a half years have passed November

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,680
2019 We were here  then it came I'm

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,539
[ __ ] covid

13
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,820
But actually when we came here

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,399
on Thursday to prepare the room for

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,960
yesterday's event the television business

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,240
that went very well actually after

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,580
10 minutes It was as if this time not

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,180
this hiding there had not been  and therefore I

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,460
am still happy this morning too It

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,500
was great to see you again I have yet to

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,580
finish hugging a lot of

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,540
people But we try to eh

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,640
to stay on time In short, to respect

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,080
the times

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,000
then

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,220
as you well know for almost 8 years

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,880
This is the Onlus that we support

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,460
are  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,500
in Kinshasa they have the banquet outside and

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,060
all the donations of the event go to

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,479
them because they do real concrete things and

32
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,460
therefore it is right  to because as I always say

33
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,020
we are fine We are healthy

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,579
we are lucky we are here we have

35
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,759
a little less fun and the updated numbers

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,100
I do not remember them but they

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,100
should keep up with 320 children

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,979
who are not few so if you want to

39
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,380
donate your 5x1000 and this  it is the

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,700
tax code however out there are

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,340

companies did not know me did not

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,739
know the event it is not easy to

50
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,180
sponsor an event of this type

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,940
that does not allow you to have

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,040
the sponsor's banquet to advertise

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,200
in a certain way and to have

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,879
speakers who are not connected to the

55
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,440
sponsor companies for  at least in a

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,900
direct way and also to be back in attendance after

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,519
two and a half years

Indeed we applaud the staff  for

171
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,360
today for yesterday

172
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,580
because they are fundamental Thanks to all

173
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,979
guys If they weren't there as

174
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,660
I always say I could  I would have a thousand

175
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,080
beautiful but unattainable ideas

176
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,639
this thing that you will now see this

177
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,259
little spoiler preview of the

178
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,259
announcement that we will do in December

179
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,780
will be a very big thing very

180
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,000
complex

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,879
I repeat I will do my best to

182
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,460
make this happen If I do not

183
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,979
succeed we will

184
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,360
surely postpone it  but it will not go into

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,979
oblivion and the spoiler is this here

186
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,539
I will not tell you anything else

187
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,120
it is not the tower of Pisa eh If anyone

188
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,580
should have any doubts it is another

189
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,470
type of Tower

190
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,580
[Applause]

191
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,200

200
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,000


201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,140

206
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,580
gluten-free version

207
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,080
and of course there is always the beer that has

208
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,220
now become the official beer of the

209
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,120
event since 2016 I have

210
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,620
n't had it yet I haven't drunk a little dry throat

211
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,420
eh

212
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,940
So it's time to activate  the

213
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,860
bracelets and brooches during

214
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,220
registration I asked

215
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,380
you if you were looking for a job now Do not

216
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,839
take, let's say these groups as how to

217
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,600
say they are the ones that, based on

218
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,060
past descriptions, group

219
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,000
a bit of everything that you

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
have requested in most but not  it means

221
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,640
that if you find a sponsor with

222
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,420
a green pin around you cannot still

223
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,640
chat, exchange information and

224
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,680
more so the bracelets

225
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,540
correspond to these groups the

226
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,279
sponsors have the Green pin

227
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,279
on the chest and a nice way to

228
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,240
interact during the event

229
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,560
a  important thing that I

230
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,860
always forget to say the email cv@kimbo.it is

231
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,560
always active where the sponsor companies

232
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,779
sometimes write to me asking Mario

233
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,380
you have this fig  ura and this other one, however,

234
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,880
you can send us updated curriculums

235
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,180
they only say courtesy in the object

236
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,140
Write me your

237
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,700
specialization directly because we go

238
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,140
so many that it is me then I

239
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,300
can not open 200 at a time and

240
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
go to sift through so remember

241
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,200
in the object to put  directly

242
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,060
your specialization so much the emails

243
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,920
that arrive there are only for the job search

244
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,180


245
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,599
ok

246
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,860
So take the phone

247
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,399
scan with telegram

248
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,620
look for the hakimbo bot thanks to

249
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,240
Massimo Massimiliano dal Cerro of

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,279
Digital difference that there is

251
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,860
optimized

252
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,540
here too there will be information on the

253
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,779
job search on the program In short,

254
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,920
read the instructions it is quite

255
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,720
simple if I did it, as I am not a computer

256
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,820
scientist, you should succeed

257
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
too and it will also help you a little

258
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,500
in managing the day an important thing is

259
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
the ticket that you have been

260
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,100
given the entrance ticket  cool as I

261
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,079
remind you it was completely offered by

262
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,240
Kimbo even yesterday  you have to keep it for the

263
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,480
whole stay in the park Because if

264
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
they ask you You don't have it you have to

265
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,279
pay the entrance and

266
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,360
the parking is not there so when

267
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,100

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,019
finally Bravo to you for the meantime for

325
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,660
having continued even during the

326
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,120
difficult moments online In my opinion it was

327
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,759
still a moment to stay attached

328
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,000
I had place Not  I know if you remember it

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
seems to me the 4-5 of March 2020 in which I

330
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,639
canceled all

331
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,500
one because I did not think this thing

332
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,079
would go ahead of the pandemic and

333
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,759
two because to me the totally

334
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,579
online event obviously God forbid I

335
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,160
understand it But it never has me  thrilled

336
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,220
you have literally flooded me with

337
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,639
messages of veiled threats because you

338
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,380
wanted to continue having the event and

339
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,720
then we continued to do it online

340
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,680
it went very well anyway because

341
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,720
we had

342
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,680
all the events thousands of people

343
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,800
connected it still went well but

344
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,480
I wanted to come back in an emergency it is not  the

345
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,180
same thing and I repeat in my opinion as if

346
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,740
we did this and we had to go back to

347
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,720
2019 as if this period had not been there

348
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,959
absolutely no

349
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,079
the faces are the same enthusiasm that is

350
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,100
the beer that is so Who is that here for the

351
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,060
first time ever

352
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,660
Who is that  all the editions have been done

353
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,180
but let's

354
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,880
not waste time let's start as

355
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,019
usual I respect you at stratospheric levels

356
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,839
Thank you for being here me

357
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,600
I am a pleasure and we said that

358
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,160
Bellis Come really was difficult

359
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,040
this year because with the two-year stop

360
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,940
this year an avalanche has arrived says

361
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,440
You did a lot of work and

362
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,839
above all difficult to choose so

363
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,360
I do not want to put pressure on the speakers
