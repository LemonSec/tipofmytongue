00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,100
banking trojan campaign

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,230
introduction treasury grace that in bur

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,850
thanks to all of you who  you are here today it is

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,920
nice to start over in presence

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,810
then today what we are going to talk about let's say

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,250
that the title is rather

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,470
quick in fact we will tell you a

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,910
bit of stories a bit of stories that

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,560
especially in the last three years

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,210
we have been able to analyze and study in

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,220
fact we will talk a bit of  what is the

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,830
current state of the world of online fraud at

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,559
this moment we will talk so we will be

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,080
very vertical in the situation in

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,729
the financial banking context and as

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,380
you can see from the title in fact it will be a

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,479
vertical presentation

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,920
regarding the mobile world and

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
specifically android

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,380
so a small presentation to me

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,240
my name is federico valentini and in this

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,890
mom  ento di riggle team of traits

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,619
intelligence and together between spouses what do

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,390
I say that I started my

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,329
career in the world of consulting for

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,060
which I mainly

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,359
dealt with penetration test mwp tir and three years ago

34
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,060
I entered in who does and with

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,409
the  'idea to create this team

36
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,630
dedicated to trenitalia seeding issues,

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,369
very specific responses are included

38
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,380
in the

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,549
banking sector

40
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,999
I leave the word

41
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,170
Hello everyone I am francesco iubatti

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,270
I too have a background similar to that of

43
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,429
federico I have mainly dealt with in the

44
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,389
past  of wight pt and

45
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,909
very vertical activities on the mobile world on the

46
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,818
device used

47
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,830
critical infrastructures for about two and a half years

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,319
work in free file I too deal with

49
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,020
particular intelligence traits

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,930
mobile malware analysis and where in the last year I

51
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,970
discovered these two new families of

52
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,150
malware jacques botes tv

53
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,680
in more detail shortly

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,980
now a few words about cli fi what is it

55
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,629
you do is a company that was born in 2014 is  in

56
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,980
fact, our mission is to

57
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,739
make digital payment channels safer,

58
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,750
so as regards for

59
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,069
example home banking we all

60
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,060
use and so on,

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,849
starting immediately because

62
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,849
this tool because we are here today

63
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,590
in fact the world of fraud  banking is

64
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,629
growing sharply especially

65
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,760
in recent years and from the developments

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,180
that have also happened it is also difficult

67
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,670
to quantify the volume of

68
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,010
losses of these attacks there

69
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,810
are estimates in which they speak precisely of

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,340
beyonce 15 billion every year and let's say

71
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,530
that at the time  nowadays it is also

72
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,040
extremely critical from

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,590
the banking point of view to

74
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,659
identify in real time and attacks

75
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,239
attack patterns malicious scenarios and

76
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,639
so on and in some cases let's say

77
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,099
it is also essential to

78
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,239
prevent these attacks so try

79
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,389
to anticipate the  next step of

80
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,609
attack so that our customers

81
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,590
or banks in general are  ready

82
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,090
to manage this problem

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,500
another thing and that maybe for those who are

84
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,129
outside the

85
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,019
test world ok for those who are outside the banking world it

86
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,879
seems in fact at least

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,260
the impression from the outside that it is a

88
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,639
very closed world that there is not too much

89
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,280
information sharing  and let's say something

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,280
that we don't like we would not want to do

91
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,260
so we think it is very interesting

92
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,030
even on occasions like today to try

93
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,099
with the info sec community what

94
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,840
are in fact some analyzes

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,599
that we believe are important to bring from you

96
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,870
so let's start starting because we say

97
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,728
as mentioned at the beginning there is a strong

98
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,560
evolution a strong growth

99
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,900
of these attacks also of the volume

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,419
we have tried to bring out

101
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,190
what are three of the main macro

102
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,260
causes that have led to

103
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,529
this strong increase the first home and

104
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:34,609
had anticipated  even before maybe

105
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,829
during the introduction and we have come from two

106
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:39,349
good years of pandemic so we are

107
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,239
all forced to stay inside houses for

108
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,369
which you imagine  even you who maybe

109
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,889
people less accustomed to using

110
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,049
mobile banking or whatever

111
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,849
else have had to have found themselves

112
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:51,969
forced to use

113
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,469
and therefore this has led

114
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,539
to a strong digital acceleration

115
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,339
that was carried out precisely by

116
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,709
banks

117
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,049
the second  the point is that in all this

118
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,819
obviously the digital channel are

119
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,409
increasingly used,

120
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,249
think you too, in short,

121
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:10,129
every day I imagine that it is just

122
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,799
a banking operations are carried out and

123
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:16,189
therefore in fact the volume is also seas

124
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,769
of existing targets or new targets,

125
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,759
the third point exploded which then  it is also

126
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,109
fundamental it concerns the

127
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,629
speed of payments nowadays it

128
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,119
turns out to be in fact everything much

129
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,889
faster so the payments

130
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,209
are also instantaneous thought of the

131
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,829
ymer prints that today we can also

132
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,109
make rather quickly

133
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:37,419
of your application

134
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,399
and this has led  at least

135
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,169
anti-fraud side of the new problems to be managed

136
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,049
like  I said before so having less and

137
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,419
less time in identifying

138
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,339
attack patterns to seek a remediation and

139
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,019
avoiding the disaster

140
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,969
now let's try for a moment to focus

141
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,639
on the part of the victims so what

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,969
are in fact the main main

143
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,459
attack techniques since even

144
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,379
out there anyway there are n  a thousand variations

145
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,559
what we have tried to do is in

146
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:11,809
fact create two macro categories that

147
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,269
would somewhat

148
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,019
identify all the types of

149
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,439
attacks that nowadays exist

150
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,849
the first category so let's talk about

151
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:22,009
account cover I guess it is a

152
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,899
pretty short attack scenario

153
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,009
known inside this classroom

154
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,889
today what actually happens an unauthorized party

155
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,300


156
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,009
michelle will access a secret that can

157
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,240
be precisely the credentials of the

158
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,520
publication a puppy anything else

159
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,770
and unauthorized

160
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,539
access to an account in this banking case

161
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,060


162
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,409
which  is obviously the goal in the

163
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,479
banking world and making cash out for which  on the basis

164
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,430
then also the application used

165
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,770
there are ntp of cash out methods it can

166
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,659
be for example an instant payment it can

167
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,240
be a sepa transfer or even

168
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,590
nowadays there are new

169
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,409
cash out methods as in fact there are

170
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,120
also many new financial products

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,150
just think of a carles withdrawal a

172
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,310
recharge of a prepaid card and so

173
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,050
on

174
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,180
typically these attacks are

175
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,150
also closely related

176
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,639
to social engineering methodologies so

177
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,379
let's say that they are born as I know if

178
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,210
the pure engineer and then we will also see

179
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,319
with francesco going on in the

180
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,150
presentation  we will see how in

181
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,949
fact many groups have tried to

182
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,330
mix social engineering techniques

183
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,000
and the use of malware to carry out

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,650
an account cover attack

185
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,569
the other important thing that as I said

186
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,940
being an attack an attack methodology

187
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,800
that needs a strong

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,539
component  of social engineering this

189
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,789
requires as much manual labor as manual labor

190
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,560
from the point of view of

191
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,300
the attack groups it also allows

192
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,169
not to scale well

193
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,630
the second category of attacks

194
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,419
which is perhaps a little much

195
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,120
more vertical than account cover and

196
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,000
the ts or automatic transfer system here

197
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,139
I wanted to try to ask you too

198
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,060
how many  of you who know this acronym

199
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,560
I have never heard of ats

200
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,310
anything else

201
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,569
I see one in line for beer who has

202
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:11,919
heard of it so

203
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,029
to take a moment to overview

204
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,369
this because they are attacks that

205
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:18,719
are as I said before very vertical

206
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,369
in the banking world so  perhaps less

207
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,659
known to those who do not work in this

208
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:22,409


209
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,939
area what these attacks actually consist of

210
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,490
are very malware days attacks

211
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,159
unlike perhaps accounts and covers and

212
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,800
therefore as you well know they scale much

213
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,198
better then in fact the

214
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,519
attack methodology consists of nothing more than

215
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,169
simplifying the  'extreme so I have a

216
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,229
compromised machine a compromised pc

217
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,279
inside which maybe the victim is

218
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
an account anyway  works

219
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,480
within your body account can be a

220
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,389
retail account

221
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:50,759
and the malware is nothing else that

222
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,440
specifically carries a piece of

223
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,449
javascript typically these

224
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,009
banking malwares that operate in this

225
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,899
way use man in the

226
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,209
browser techniques so typically what

227
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,980
they go to go to throw themselves

228
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,149
into an

229
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,250
authentic browsing session so in fact and

230
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,779
the victim who is accessing their

231
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,459
account to make a genuine disposition

232
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,860
the malware at that moment in throws

233
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,839
through the browser mind what in

234
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,690
fact is in jargon is  defined web

235
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,699
inject kit which is nothing more than a

236
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,040
highly taylor code and for

237
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,079
the application and which in fact and plates

238
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,350
nanny because it does nothing but develop

239
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,850
a genuine transaction so I

240
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,380
find myself seen logging

241
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,170
into the inter  new in my

242
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,300
straight body account for example I go to make

243
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,500
a transaction and at the time of

244
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,660
authorization they typically

245
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,399
enter this phase  it is this javascript

246
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,949
thrown that alters the beneficiary and

247
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,660
this therefore involves a slot of the

248
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,209
transaction typically towards a bank

249
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,740
account that directly or

250
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,930
indirectly

251
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,739
managed by the attacking group

252
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,290
here in this slide tried a bit to

253
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,089
visualize these two worlds so

254
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:59,009
see just to the side on your

255
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,180
left

256
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,860
the cover account for which in

257
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,240
attack methodologies that as I said before are

258
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,829
based on both social

259
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,470
engineering components and malware components and then

260
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,519
we will see even more

261
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,009
specifically some examples with francesco on

262
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,540
the right side we have the whole world

263
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,509
of atias so this case  attacks

264
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,069
or attack methodology that scale

265
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,529
much better much more expensive from the point

266
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,110
of view of the actor who is behind and

267
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,059
which are mainly based on

268
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,990
malicious components

269
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,820
going on

270
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,370
here we have tried

271
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,750
to visualize a bit what are the

272
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,190
trends especially in the  last two years

273
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,790
and that we begin to make a distinction on

274
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,340
two macr  o categories for which we have

275
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,260
the world of corporate banking at the top, at the

276
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,480
bottom the world of retail this because

277
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
because even historically both actors and

278
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,980
attack methodologies are very

279
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,840
different in the two worlds for which we have the

280
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,010
corporate world where historically

281
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,360
groups that use

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,580
an approach act  almost malware bass for which

283
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,140
I took will be the part of the

284
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,240
social component for thanks I was

285
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,579
expecting a beer or less the same

286
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,259
there will obviously be a

287
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,459
social part at least as regards

288
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,049
the start of the attack for which the

289
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,279
classic e-mail or anything else of

290
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,869
phishing  but then from that moment on it

291
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,999
turns out to be heavily malware bes

292
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,549
as I said and let's say that it is something that

293
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:27,889
continues to be there even today that is

294
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,379
what we are seeing is that

295
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,230
malus and work stations are also starting to

296
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,670
include in their own

297
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,619
campaigns  attack of the components to

298
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,029
expand the surface the attack towards

299
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,309
mobile devices and we will see an

300
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:43,040
example shortly however c  we continue with we continue to

301
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,230
say to be very very present

302
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,519
even today for a

303
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,319
specific reason because companies continue

304
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,999
mainly to operate from work

305
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,279
stations

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,079
then we instead have in the lower part the

307
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,449
whole world of retail banking retail

308
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,670
banking therefore private accounts where in

309
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,649
fact historically there were campaigns

310
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,329
attack where maybe they were also based

311
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,970
totally on the phishing attack and

312
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,999
then what we have seen in the but

313
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,139
especially over the last two years

314
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:12,949
and the increase of mobile malware precisely

315
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,389
to carry out these

316
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:16,189
campaigns so from this moment on

317
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,709
what typically  you can see they are

318
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,480
attacks that are mix and therefore we will have

319
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,919
component of social engineering and

320
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,649
use of mobile malware we have

321
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,600
also reported some examples

322
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,119
you see precisely by sms stealer

323
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,939
which are the malware let's say more trivial

324
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,459
or that typically have a task

325
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,249
then that of in the specific case

326
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,749
intercept otp code in the

327
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:39,949
authorization phase  tation of a payment for

328
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,929
example intercepting credentials or

329
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,879
credit card details

330
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,639
then depends a little on the type of attack

331
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,799
this thing has taken a lot especially

332
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,110
in the last two years where

333
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,179
new families of malware have also been born,

334
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,029
including real internal

335
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:57,439
functionality of  rath therefore the

336
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,259
one that even today we start to

337
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,360
use the term on device fraud

338
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,189
or the attacker who maybe effect

339
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,079
an account and cover does not carry out

340
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,610
the attack perhaps from a device

341
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,980
connected through perhaps IP addresses or in

342
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,959
any case a network fingerprinting very

343
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,790
different from  victim but tend to

344
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,529
operate directly remotely from the

345
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,430
mobile phone

346
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,900
to end up in one of the latest

347
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,120
trends that we are seeing in

348
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,640
the last period and which is called taxes das

349
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,620
what does draw per as a service mean

350
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,250
what are the droppers typically you have to

351
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,170
see that in the android world the

352
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,570
most of these applications are

353
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,200
shared obviously not through

354
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,820
the official stores  so in the case of

355
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,040
google google play store what we

356
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,510
are seeing in this last period and

357
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,400
that instead many attack groups are

358
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,260
starting to industrialize this

359
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,690
process that in fact the process of

360
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,440
inserting applications that are

361
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,780
genuine or that nevertheless never

362
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,640
pass even  machine

363
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,050
learning controls and anything else adopted by

364
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,780
google and in fact what they have have

365
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,670
a hidden functionality that

366
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,430
is then activated as a fake update is

367
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,470
one of the methodologies that is

368
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,270
used to actually make a

369
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,310
fake update and pull yourself inside

370
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,530
the application was there or in fact

371
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,089
the real malware

372
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,030
in the graph of the first name was

373
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,430
mentioned cerberus cerberus because it was

374
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,740
very important in fact it is one of

375
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,470
the malware families and that has emerged and has

376
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,590
also received a lot of attention, let's say

377
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,440
also from  media point of view

378
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,030
the interesting thing about cerberus is that

379
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,300
the responsible group worked with

380
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,060
the malware paradigm  as a service

381
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,460
malore service what does it mean I

382
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,710
build my own malware but in fact

383
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,240
I am not going to use it

384
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,390
directly rather I rent it perhaps to

385
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,760
groups or affiliates who can then in

386
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,170
fact autonomously carry out

387
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,050
their own attack campaign

388
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,040
what happened to  a certain point of

389
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,600
developers decided well we

390
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
stop the project so

391
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,710
we try to make first sell all the

392
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,690
sources and all the sources of the aunt

393
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,750
of the malware then of the android course

394
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,830
of the control infrastructure and

395
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,350
see what happens this was

396
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,510
what they had in  mind

397
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,100
at the beginning what actually

398
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,890
happened and that initially at the heart there

399
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,830
started to circulate among a

400
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,620
small group of users in this forum that

401
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,210
used they used the developers

402
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,830
to then be publicly available

403
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,380
I believe that among other things it is also

404
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,840
available  on guitar so anyone

405
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,530
can take it analyze it study it

406
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,820
but time is on what happens

407
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,160
like this and c  he other groups

408
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,420
having this code available

409
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,070
can in fact give it

410
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,810
to us within their own

411
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,940
attack campaigns and this is what

412
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,620
happened in the specific case of

413
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,390
cerberus.Here we report an example of

414
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,860
a very

415
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,450
well-known banking [ __ ] family who  it is called gozzi and cadi

416
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,910
typically operates in the corporate

417
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,270
banking field so as I said before, gozi

418
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,930
actually has a web module inside it

419
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,790
in jack for which typically

420
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,380
these but then not

421
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,450
configuration files inside with the n

422
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,700
targets of the  campaign

423
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,350
so what happens there I victim

424
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,390
I visit one of these sites comes in

425
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,920
throw a javascript inside

426
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,820
my obsession well 1 an example of a

427
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,860
configuration that we have extracted from

428
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,230
a campaign of gozzi in fact

429
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,940
included this function that you see here

430
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,740
that you  called showdown lo del dap

431
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,170
this function was a

432
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,840
very trivial function that can be called from the outside

433
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,670
by the group responsible for the operators

434
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,210
by the fraud operators and what he did

435
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,100
he did nothing other than throwing

436
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,110
the html code within the

437
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,790
session so in fact the user is

438
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,440
visiting the site or the bank

439
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,940
is not inside a portal that is difficult for

440
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,580
anything else and it would appear  this

441
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,560
pop up this papacy what it did

442
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,890
invited the user to actually scan

443
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,080
a qr code install an application

444
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,530
inside their device

445
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,670
then once the user downloads

446
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,089
in short, scan it this qr code

447
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,650
was sent back to a fake google play

448
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,689
store  created ad hoc by the attackers

449
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,699
and which in fact invited the download

450
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,670
now before leaving the word

451
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,030
francesco and we will see

452
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,520
we tried to

453
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
say

454
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,010
characterize this evolution that

455
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,260
we are seeing in the world of

456
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,820
banking trojans on android

457
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,130
specifically and we tried to

458
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,750
identify three  macro

459
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,680
categories of malicious applications

460
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,330
the first category as I mentioned

461
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,040
earlier and the information

462
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,220
stealer category  therefore simple malware from the

463
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,630
point of view of features for which they

464
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,490
typically have a feature and [ __ ]

465
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,460
which is to intercept otip codes

466
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,740
sent via sms intercept

467
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,960
credentials or intercept credit card data

468
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,910


469
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,730
then we move on to the second category

470
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,900
which was a bit as I said before to the

471
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,370
model  cerberus for which they are

472
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,200
applications that aim to

473
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,090
remotely obtain total control of the

474
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,800
infected device

475
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,170
this because to avoid, for example, it

476
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,820
is to roll a new device,

477
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,270
however, give more indicators to the

478
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,370
anti-fraud in this case to identify ok

479
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,630
this session I do not like  because it

480
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,400
comes from unipi never seen by

481
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
the user the device never seen historically for which he

482
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,710
suspects

483
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,900
and the third the third category that

484
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,760
we are going to see is precisely that of

485
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,550
the ratt that include

486
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,800
this module of ats as I said before

487
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,650
the attacks of type of  they are not

488
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,750
new they are also very well established

489
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,160
within the modern banking trojans

490
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,100
are  new in the mobile point of view

491
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,570
so what we are

492
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,920
starting to see that new families

493
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,320
such as shark both which

494
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,150
I will talk about shortly francesco have

495
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,800
begun to include this

496
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,960
attack methodology also within mobile channels

497
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,120
and is in fact the la  first

498
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,720
time you see upscale at this moment

499
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,250
well thank you i leave the word to

500
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,510
francesco who will continue the

501
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,140
presentation

502
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,590
thanks ok let's start going a bit in

503
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,470
detail on each of these families

504
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,240
let's start with info steelers usually

505
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,929
these applications are very

506
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,549
trivial since it implements a

507
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,399
single feature but at the same time they

508
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,940
do not have e vision methodologies such as

509
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,669
blurs show in the encryption code of

510
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,669
communications and so on however even

511
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:48,100
if they are very trivial as applications

512
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,929
very often as you see they are not

513
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,000
dictated by antivirus

514
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,370
this because usually these

515
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,110
applications and from the moment  which are

516
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,720
very easy to build

517
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,909
they change very fast  emente

518
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,940
or they use certain

519
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,980
methodologies such as jing flaws or

520
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,190
they take a legitimate application they

521
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,809
alter the code then in throwing some

522
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,059
malicious code rim package they

523
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,679
all have and distribute this new

524
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:15,480
application

525
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,210
and consequently finding this

526
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,789
malicious code inside an application

527
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,509
can be difficult

528
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:27,100
so what are these information

529
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,850
they are interested in and the attackers

530
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,570
as anticipated by federico are sms

531
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,940
credit cards and the

532
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,639
login credentials of the banks

533
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,230
let's go into detail in each of these

534
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,509
types

535
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,970
sms steelers usually these

536
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,870
applications are deliberated through

537
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,429
social engineering methodologies and therefore

538
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,490
fishing smishing  so on this because

539
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,700
because the human component is

540
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,379
fundamental since these malware do not

541
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,690
use android vulnerabilities in usa no

542
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,899
zero day but then try to

543
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:07,330
manually install the application to the

544
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,360
victim and above all they must then

545
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,360
accept permissions like this or

546
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,809
change the default applications for

547
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,059
the management of sms so that the

548
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,789
malware is able to intercept these sms

549
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,450
and shoot reverse in c2

550
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,730
therefore these social engineering methodologies

551
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,480


552
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,230
very often also serve to

553
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,640
persuade the user to install these

554
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,190
applications and from here we can see

555
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,610
some techniques used very often

556
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,309
such as the use of icons or names and

557
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,400
messaging trust applications

558
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,380
or with references to

559
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,530
target banks and or antivirus solutions

560
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,630
another widely used technique is

561
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,490
precisely the repackaging that I have already

562
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,220
explained to you before but we will see shortly a

563
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,830
concrete example or they are

564
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,690
used precisely those is called the

565
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,540
fec bank operator or they are the three tac

566
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,760
toe themselves and who call after having

567
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,440
recovered the mobile number of the

568
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,500
victims call the victims and

569
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,120
pretending to be banking towers

570
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,140
basically ask him to

571
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,610
install this application in  after

572
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,890
having restored a certain

573
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,700
trust relationship  with the user

574
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,840
obviously once the user goes to

575
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,760
accept these permissions then he goes to

576
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,820
give the malware the possibility to

577
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,100
intercept the sms you can see in the

578
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,410
first image that the perfect malware

579
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,559
a post makes a guest to send them sms to

580
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,240
a control panel of them

581
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,820
administration

582
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,880
let's see a concrete case of sms

583
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,210
style in this case the attackers

584
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,860
what they did they used

585
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,740
a legitimate open source

586
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,640
messaging application called chiuque and the sms

587
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,040
then the code can be found on the tab

588
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,480
because in fact a

589
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,730
legitimate application and also on  google play store

590
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,190
find the application in

591
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,840
fact what the attackers did what

592
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,410
was downloaded the code from guitar

593
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,850
add functionality to

594
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,700
package everything is basically

595
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,150
deliberate these applications through

596
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,980
phishing campaigns in the image

597
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,740
you can see the classes in red then

598
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,620
the code  who invented

599
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,049


600
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,450
the functionality of  this misrule

601
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,220
practically 21 clearly that of

602
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,260
intercepting the sms

603
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,290
the other was to make najd then

604
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,929
hide all the sms that received the

605
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:43,370
life this because

606
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,230
imagine the following scenario the user

607
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,230
is trying to log into the

608
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,380
bank's website

609
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,730
but the bank  asks him for your factor

610
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,250
authentication to continue the login

611
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,710
which in theory should be sent

612
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,380
via sms consequently if the user

613
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,049
does not see to receive these ms he

614
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:07,049
asks for new ones obviously these

615
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,850
sms are actually arriving on

616
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,070
the victim's device but are hidden therefore

617
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,750
not

618
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,419
release or sound notifications are shown and are actually

619
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,809
sent to the attacker cycle

620
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,580
consequently the attackers will have

621
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,010
more codes or types and more pin codes that they

622
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,500
can use to confirm more

623
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,929
fraudulent operations or

624
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:31,280
really make a new device

625
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,409
another scenario

626
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,150
we have studied  a few years ago

627
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,520
unfortunately it ended up on the google play

628
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,830
store of  Consequently, when this

629
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,950
happens, even

630
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,150
slightly more experienced users who

631
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,490
know how to recognize a phishing site

632
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,490
know that they do not have to download

633
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,490
an application from unofficial stores, they

634
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,110
risk falling victim to

635
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,970
these types of fraud because, in

636
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,250
any case, the malware comes from a

637
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,049
source  the application was therefore accepted by the

638
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,570
user and

639
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,280
in fact it was very trivial

640
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,460
and a web view therefore simply

641
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,710
showed a phishing site

642
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,809
within an application and as you can see

643
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:16,169
the goal was to steal credentials or tb

644
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:18,870
and credit cards from t  of credit cards

645
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,928


646
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,090
we finally move on to the last type of

647
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,419
style info because they are malware

648
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,480
that aim to steal

649
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,100
credentials

650
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,870
the consolidated technique and which now

651
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,330
use practically all malware

652
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,700
in the last two years is the so-called

653
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,419
having them attack is a technique that consists

654
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,440
in showing a clone page above

655
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,350
the legitimate application or as

656
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,350
what it consists of once the user  the body must

657
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,019
install this malware

658
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,029
the malware able to understand that

659
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,769
the user is trying to open

660
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:00,750
the application of the bank that

661
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,240
targets the malware and during the

662
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,519
opening phase of the legitimate application

663
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,080


664
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
the malware shows a clone page

665
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,940
therefore identical above the  'application

666
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,279
of the bank consequently if the user

667
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,090
then enters the credentials

668
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,960
within this clone page they

669
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,169
are sent to a

670
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:25,440
very difficult c2 asset, let's say to understand that

671
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,389
you are under attack for you because in

672
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,330
any case the overlapping phase is

673
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,429
practically simultaneous therefore

674
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:34,730
difficult to notice

675
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,649
but in fact how these attacks are made

676
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,019
have them that is how they

677
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,539
are built

678
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,889
through as you can see in the first image

679
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:46,559
of the web pages in fact therefore

680
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,100
composed of html css javascript codes

681
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,850
which is practically a

682
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,850
faithfully replicate a login page of

683
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,059
the bank  this clone comes

684
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,250
pressed from the malware code in the

685
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,080
second image and po  i rendered

686
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,289
in the attack phase

687
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:09,750
if you try for example during the

688
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,639
attack phase to click the button to see

689
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:12,799
which applications are

690
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,629
currently open from android you can

691
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,179
see that in the foreground you have

692
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,309
the clone application and behind

693
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,940
the application  original

694
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,379
before said that this is the most

695
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:28,139
consolidated technique because in fact because it is

696
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:30,450
very scalable in the sense that they the

697
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,320
malware

698
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,529
the priest now needs to insert a

699
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,940
new target therefore a new

700
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,370
bank application does not have to

701
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,740
modify the malware code but there it is

702
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,379
enough to create a  new clone page and

703
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:47,029
let's say everything works

704
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,850
let's move on to the second type of

705
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,240
banking they are the herat banks

706
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,610
unlike the previous category

707
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,830
so the ufo steelers these malware

708
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,290
are very advanced because

709
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,810
first of all they have many features so

710
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,730
it does not do not only on the thing but

711
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,800
they manage to  do different

712
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,110
also implement many features

713
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,560
division so they hate an emulator

714
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
they are able to test if you are using

715
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,840
a debugger they encrypt the communications between

716
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,860
the c2 application and so on

717
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,860
here removed some examples in this

718
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,560
case the family of this malware is

719
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,300
called alien that a successor of

720
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,000
cerberus of which federico has already spoken

721
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,700
before and in  image on the left you can

722
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,150
see let's say the list of

723
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,890
basically commands that the malware

724
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,960
manages to manage how to remove

725
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,910
applications then the malware able

726
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,940
to detest if inside the dl of the

727
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,430
infected device there is an

728
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,340
antivirus and remove it or able

729
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,050
to remove itself  in case he

730
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,740
understands that he is inside a sandbox

731
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,660
or make audio record and so on

732
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,970
here he underlined an

733
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,730
interesting feature that is the possibility of

734
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,650
stealing the codes of the google

735
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,900
authenticator so even if you have

736
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,390
let's say do not use the sms covered

737
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,340
made teeth that had a  '

738
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,320
external application the malo was still able

739
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,720
to open and read code to use it at

740
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720


741
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,160
will  another example and another

742
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,640
rather well-known family or very

743
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,070
powerful malware that as you can see

744
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,510
can retrieve a lot of information

745
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,330
from the

746
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,190
infected device such as the battery level the

747
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,910
country the mobile number if the

748
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,160
screen is active or not or if it is

749
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,960
successful  to take certain

750
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,390
permissions obviously this information,

751
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,760
as you can see, is then sent to a c2

752
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,440
or as I told you these malware

753
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,420
adopt division

754
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,150
charlotte techniques for example it uses a dg a

755
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,430
domain generation algorithms that

756
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,380
substantially serves the malware to

757
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,430
be resident in take down actions

758
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,920
that is over  if these malware must

759
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,750
always communicate obviously with a c2

760
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,200
in such a way that the three tacs for giving

761
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,390
instructions on what to do with it at a given

762
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,530
moment

763
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,090
but the malware must

764
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,530
send information to the

765
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,330
attacker at the same time to know what is

766
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,640
happening on the victim's device

767
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,400
then  if authority and knock down the

768
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,740
domain then the malware server

769
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,750
however the malware let's say that it dies there

770
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,320
and through this feature the malware knows

771
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,480
precisely that it can contact a

772
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,220
dozen domains so even if

773
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,320
two servers are knocked down

774
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,730
nothing happens

775
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,830
and also these domains are created

776
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,230
in the case of sharbat weekly

777
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,500
so 56 domains every week are

778
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,690
created in such a way as to be resilient

779
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,500
to any hi tech action dow

780
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,850
another example i used

781
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,860
from pretty much all evils in this case

782
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,000
reported a family named oscorp

783
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,980
quite recent last year where

784
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,840
you can see that the code is all it

785
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,890
was then  the strings are encrypted

786
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,030
different algorithms are used

787
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,650
such as rc4 as so on and also

788
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,270
communications in this case are

789
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,920
encrypted in some cases

790
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
also algorithms and

791
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,650
asymmetric so m c are used

792
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,980
but in fact how do these malwares

793
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,360
get this full control of the

794
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,670
device then get all these

795
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,830
information or recovered example such as

796
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,160
go codes  ogle authenticator also in

797
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,650
this case as the previous category

798
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,470
does not use vulnerabilities but in fact

799
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,600
uses some features of their own

800
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,090
in reality it abuses these features which

801
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,450
are the axes bilitis harris these

802
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,890
accessible services for those who do not

803
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,320
know them are a feature of android is

804
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,380
put  available mainly for

805
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,820
users with disabilities so through

806
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,490
these features users with disabilities

807
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,850
are able to interact with the device

808
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,320
what the attackers did and

809
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,130
abuse it and as you can see from the image the

810
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,660
first thing

811
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,360
that malware does when it is installed and

812
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,480
show a pop up in  repeated way where it

813
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,400
asks the user to accept these

814
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,570
permissions

815
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,800
obviously once they are

816
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,040
accepted you see below

817
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,690
what the malware will be able to do

818
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,390
so observe the actions made

819
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,820
by the user

820
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,230
find content within the

821
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,880
applications

822
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,770
any application observe the

823
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,600
written text therefore also  in some

824
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,240
cases, passwords or personal data

825
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,280
such as credit cards and finally

826
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,050
carry out gestures then also

827
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,020
click on aip so let's say the goal

828
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,930
of these malware to have full

829
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,960
control of the device remotely

830
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,870
to carry out fraud as

831
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,930
federico told you from a distance but above all

832
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,700
from the victim's device in  so as to

833
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,560
be less detested by the banks

834
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,700
obviously every family of malware has

835
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,010
implemented alongside the

836
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,110
service killers also other protocols or

837
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,000
other methodologies to have full

838
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,490
persistence in this case in yen

839
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,280
used teamviewer therefore a

840
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,250
known legitimate tool in fact but they

841
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,770
used it to have  a

842
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,930
greater persistence within the infected device

843
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,610
or I hit that it is implemented,

844
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,200
let's say an algorithm where it

845
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,590
basically went to make screenshots

846
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,870
every after every few seconds in order

847
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,090
to monitor what the user did

848
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,160
and retrieve interesting information

849
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,740
such as the balance in the accounts

850
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,250
and  so on or oscorp which uses a

851
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,690
pr  otocollo known as web rtc used

852
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,880
for example also by google in the stadium to

853
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,639
basically have

854
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,309
a continuous streaming and see

855
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,029
what the user was

856
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:09,768
doing about oscorp we

857
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:12,168
reported a case that we analyzed

858
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:15,260
of fraud where everything started through a

859
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,859
message containing a link  phishing

860
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:21,949
where the user the user was asked

861
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,109
to enter the banking credentials the

862
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:26,289
mobile number

863
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:29,299
the user unfortunately clicks or this link

864
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:32,059
entered this data and after a few minutes

865
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:34,460
the operator then the attacker called

866
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,000
the victim pretending to be the anti-fraud

867
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,190
bank and for security reasons

868
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,230
he had told him to install a new

869
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,829
application that would be used precisely

870
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:48,469
to clean the cell phone from mauro and so

871
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,250
on

872
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,639
the user downloaded this this this

873
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,469
malware this application is in fact

874
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,809
the attackers were able to make

875
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,910
unauthorized transactions

876
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,890
l  'user described the thing as if he

877
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,200
saw a video inside his

878
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,029
device but in fact  or it was the earthquake users who

879
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:12,430
operated on his mobile phone

880
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,180
finally we move on to the latest type

881
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,059
of bank air banking or the banker

882
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,029
rats with an ats module are in fact

883
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:24,160


884
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,680
very advanced applications such as that of the bank in

885
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,900
ruck that we have just seen but they have

886
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,210
in fact  an

887
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,609
additional module or they manage to do

888
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,980
ats that federico explained to you then

889
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,349
an iban slot during the transaction phase

890
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,740


891
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,430
the malware that we

892
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,410
recently discovered then at the end of 2021 that

893
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,170
we called sharbat is able to

894
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,880
do just this or when

895
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,579
the  user to make a transaction

896
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,589
the malware acts manages to intercept

897
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,990
this portion

898
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,080
of code then

899
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,460
insertion of the iban in it is

900
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,570
developed with an iban mule therefore of the

901
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,080
dl 3 factor

902
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,910
in fact these malwares unlike

903
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,800
the previous category are very

904
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,470
custom this because in any case each

905
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,720
transaction phase of a bancar application

906
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,260
other than above therefore

907
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,390
require more effort to create

908
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,640
que  sti malware however the benefit is

909
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,910
to be able to carry out

910
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,950
fraud almost completely automatically

911
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,960
unlike the herat banks where

912
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
the live operators have to stay to make

913
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
these transactions

914
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,320
as they manage to do ats obviously

915
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,500
always through the abuse of assistants

916
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,820
so how  you see in the first image

917
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,970
the malware practically manages to do it

918
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,740
complete scraping of what is

919
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,070
happening on the device plus the use

920
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,400
of two of a configuration file

921
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,380
then the second and third image where

922
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,050
substantially the malware is

923
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,990
instructed to do certain actions

924
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,359
based on  what you see then for

925
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,210
example in the case of the command inject

926
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,640
there is a list of applications in which

927
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,420
they are present on the infected device is

928
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,070
activated for example the

929
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,940
attack functionality for you

930
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,190
in the case of sniffer same thing there is a

931
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,950
list of applications  and in which

932
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,150
the keylogging functions are activated

933
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,160
or in the special case there are

934
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,780
real companies  oni that the malware

935
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,730
must do such as the click action

936
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,600


937
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,910
if it encounters united for example and that it is

938
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,190
called fingerprint into cancel button

939
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,740
with the same logic if it encounters a

940
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,530
field called iban the malware able

941
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,630
to understand that all good will end

942
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,820
up there  manages to do this by slot during the

943
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,109
transaction

944
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,060
another technique or rather used

945
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,220
by these malware and the alteration of

946
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,500
the copy values in pes so for example it is

947
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,780
known that the user many times copies and paste

948
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,790
the iban because a very long 

949
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,010
tring or  the wallet of

950
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,680
a paper currency application and then

951
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,310
during the paste phase he blurts out the

952
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,560
value then changes the value of the liman

953
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,320
unfortunately even these

954
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,300
so advanced applications sometimes I manage to end up

955
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,190
on the google plus store this is an

956
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,020
example of an application that  it has been

957
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,480
downloaded over five thousand times and in

958
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,820
fact it was charlotte uses the technique

959
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,700
that federico also told me or

960
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,500
that of the robber basically

961
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,050
the attackers

962
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,880
load  anus on the google play store of

963
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,740
apparently legitimate applications

964
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,440
such as in this case an antivirus that from

965
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,020
a certain point onwards will require an

966
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,440
update and instead of downloading an

967
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,599
update it downloads the malware then

968
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,980
the core of the malware

969
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,710
obviously this abuse of the

970
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,500
rather smoky acrid killers and  google has

971
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,599
decided to make a decision

972
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:12,260
or starting from version 13 of

973
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,190
android

974
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,750
performance will be applied

975
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,880
or manually installed applications

976
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,970
will be blocked for

977
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,609
security reasons

978
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:25,869
obviously we all work

979
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:28,029
in the secure field of and therefore we know

980
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:30,099
that every time it is raised

981
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:30,849
the bar

982
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:32,670
every time

983
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,950
a countermeasure is put in place typically the

984
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,930
attackers react and try to

985
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,260
bypass these restrictions

986
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,119
so what can we expect in the

987
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,490
short term future anyway in the medium

988
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,490
term but certainly a greater for

989
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,619
by the attackers in trying to

990
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,839
load these  simple malware  re more

991
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:55,000
often on google plus return such as to

992
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,619
completely bypass these

993
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,990
restrictions and unfortunately this is a

994
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,089
trend that we have already been observing for about

995
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:04,029
3 4 months or more and more malware from

996
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:07,329
families known as sharm keyboard vultur

997
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:11,430
are ending up on the google play store

998
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,019
or we can expect  the

999
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,880
creation of new types of malware and

1000
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,609
therefore malware that will no longer exploit

1001
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,859
these and these physical assassins

1002
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:24,630
team to new methodologies

1003
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,849
or banker of is a bit pitti and

1004
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:30,700
therefore very chaste but on the target then

1005
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,400
on the bank to attack trying to

1006
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,559
exploit also vulnerabilities and  this is

1007
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,109
a case that we are already observing on

1008
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:41,440
the work station world

1009
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,569
and therefore very vertical malware and therefore we expect that

1010
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:46,059
sooner or later it will be able to say also

1011
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:48,329
to the mobile world

1012
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:51,640
and finally who knows also an expansion

1013
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,319
towards a perimeter that is currently

1014
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:55,740
not used much by attackers

1015
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,009
or  new malware on ios thanks

1016
