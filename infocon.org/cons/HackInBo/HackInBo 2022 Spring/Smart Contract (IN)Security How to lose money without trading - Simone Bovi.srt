1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,730
I don't steal any more time from simone

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,640
bovi here he is, simone will talk to us about

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,580
smart contract insecurity how to lose my

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,029
name without training

5
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,270


6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,759


7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,680


8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,410


9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,660
time then start from this

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,480
part forgive me a little bit of emotion

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,430
here is

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,309
the title is smart contracting security

13
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,679
how to lose money guide or trading how to

14
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,699
lose money without trading

15
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,829
right so out of curiosity to know

16
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,870
a little bit who you are what you do

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,390
how many of you per lift  have

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,980
never had anything to do with the

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,570
crypto world let's say

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,340
you never wanted to have anything to

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,640
do with the crisis world is ok so a good

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,190
number

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,409
of you who have lost the

24
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,799
gray world well then we are in good

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,409
company and here we will see still other ways

26
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,540
to lose money in the

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,670
crypto world that a moment that I take the

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,939
microphone

29
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,590
then in the meantime who I am in a short

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,390
presentation I am simone bovi I am  a

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,829
freelance security consultant

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,439
I mainly deal with

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,399
mobile web application security I do training

34
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,590
that is these things that I imagine

35
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,479
most of you have been working

36
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,899
with me

37
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,509
for a number of years I have been collaborating with

38
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,869
a company that is a b defender we are

39
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,450
little ones here  my colleagues david

40
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,720
danelon andrea cocco and we

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,790
deal with these issues here in a

42
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,460
very focused way we also

43
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,250
say day

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,220
focus not only then on smart contrast but

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,330
also on cloud security avs etc.

46
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,740
there we are interested in

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,200
all this kind of things

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
you see them in the slide a

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,070
I have included this book because it

50
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,810
may be inherent to what

51
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,320
we are going to talk about but I also had

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,130
the pleasure of collaborating on this

53
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,600
book called mastering the

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,390
lightning network written by the great

55
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,290
andrea santoni plus who I don't know if you are

56
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,300
a little bit of the world in this

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,550
crypto world but it is

58
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,620
the largest we say popularizer at the

59
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,330
moment of everything  ello that concerns

60
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,910
bitcoin mainly quite a

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,590
maximalist but also something of itself

62
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,270
tearoom this a book I had

63
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,980
the opportunity to participate in because the

64
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,380
nice thing was that you could collaborate

65
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,270
in a penn source way the book you can

66
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,100
not even buy it because it is online on

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
kitab  it was a collaborative effort and

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,790
done because a small part but

69
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,010
no one inserted it because for me it

70
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,670
was a good opportunity

71
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,100
ok what we will talk about

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,830
today since the topic is very new

73
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,959
the topic is very new what

74
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,019
I was pleased to do was  first try

75
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,720
to make an introduction on what

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,160
the block chain is from the technical point of view

77
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,430
on what smart contracts are and then

78
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,720
continue

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,250
going to see what the

80
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,900
risks are because they were different risks

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,060
from those that are perhaps

82
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,280
normal web applications and then  we will also

83
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,360
analyze in practice

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,860
some real attacks and other attacks,

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,760
let's say more demos but which were

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,989
useful because they were  we

87
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,280
are also representative of the real real attacks

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,820


89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,730
ok so let's start talking about

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,238
what the dinner blog is and then let

91
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,029
's see what ablation is in dt rome ok and then

92
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,350
we will also see some differences with

93
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,330
the bitcoin world that maybe some of you

94
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,820
he is a little bit more he knows it a little

95
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,000
better

96
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,840
ok let's start right away with this graph

97
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,540
here don't get scared after there is one

98
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,000
even maybe a little bit more

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,140
naughty but let's try to explain it

100
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,690
then in the meantime what is a

101
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,400
block chain dinner as the name implies  itself is

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,130
a chain of blocks

103
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,110
is a chain of blocks and each block

104
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,640
contains data these data

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,680
are let's say mainly transactions

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,300
bars are also a whole other series of

107
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,750
fields that can come in handy

108
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,330
if you see at the top it has been written

109
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,970
longest proof awards nod let's see  a

110
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,820
moment to explain

111
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,230
first let's talk about the prof.sa work then

112
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,920
let's see what is meant by longest

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,180
practically how this

114
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,830
system works in general after the shots but

115
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,300
some small  the difference but just the

116
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
system in general which is that we have

117
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,260
a chain of blocks and why a

118
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,650
chain is a chain because each block is

119
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,490
linked to the previous block

120
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,680
because inside the block is ver we have an

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,390
eder and a body just like

122
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,760
http protocol let's say

123
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
we have

124
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,180
the reference to the lecce of the

125
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,550
previous block as well as curiosity this

126
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,930
comes out is the algorithm but it is called that kakà

127
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,760
256 which I imagine many of you

128
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,870
have never heard is similar to a3 and it is

129
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,810
an exit of a whole series of fields

130
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,160
that we will then see  better when we have to

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,690
see what is in the blocks so the

132
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,110
chain is formed like this here

133
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,540
and then what happens then we have this

134
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,640
block chain but being that the

135
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,890
system is decentralized ok so

136
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,200
we have all the peer nodes there is no

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,050
node  more important than the others it is

138
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,970
necessary to solve the famous problem

139
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,100
of Byzantine generals or it is a

140
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,380
problem in which there must be a bit of

141
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,450
a way to make sure that

142
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,040
d  and the messages in a

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,730
system that could have some beautiful

144
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,760
failures son that could be in

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,530
good faith let's also say someone who

146
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,400
inside tries to ruin this system

147
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,190
so the

148
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,710
so-called consensus algorithms are needed of which the prof a

149
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,200
work is one of these to make sure  that the

150
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,640
nodes of the network reach a consensus on

151
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,010
which the brussels is the

152
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,850
reference block chain ok longest prof awards

153
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,090
chain because because the one

154
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,100
with the greatest chain work is used it is said that is

155
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,650
with the greatest number of ash made in

156
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,640
this chain

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,020
this to avoid that in the case  in which they

158
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,940
are mined now then we explain

159
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,500
what determined two blocks at the

160
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,530
same time the nodes of the network that

161
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,020
validate these blocks know which

162
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,680
is the reference chain to take

163
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,330
because within the network we have

164
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,850
normal ok nodes that validate

165
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,070
the blocks  and then we have miners instead of

166
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,560
what they do what the meyer

167
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,840
is they deal with solving

168
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,850
mathematical problems and  they

169
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,090
compete with each other and whoever wins

170
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,910
in this challenge

171
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,060
has the privilege of being able to add a

172
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,590
block to the chain and receive a

173
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,590
concern ok clearly since there

174
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,060
are nodes that do not have these blocks

175
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,220
the  miner has no interest in

176
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,130
wasting high computational power

177
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,170
to create invalid blocks and

178
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,150
therefore we create this system in which there is

179
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,650
a collective interest to do the best thing

180
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,620


181
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,470
is inside these eders of

182
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,150
these blocks we also have

183
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,640
structures  which are merkle 3 in

184
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,260
reality the myths are not patricia but

185
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,970
apple trees which are something a little

186
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,410
more particular but let's say that for

187
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,730
what interests us they are

188
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,340
binary trees only that can be read

189
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,140
let's say from the bottom up then

190
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,650
we open in  low of transactions is

191
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,930
done leaves chain at 22

192
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,420
up to the routh brand which we say

193
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,890
represents a push firmware of

194
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,870
all transactions

195
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,030
this system because  é is useful because

196
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,490
in case someone wants to know if

197
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,200
there is a transaction in a block it is

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,299
simply necessary to supply the mer

199
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,610
with ruth it is a merkle pad

200
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,990
ok this merckle pad so

201
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,520
simply a part of this tree

202
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,640
at much less computational effort

203
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,230
respect to go and look for it in a

204
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,260
classic structure

205
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,760
there is also goals and you also see that there is

206
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,280
a notation of a no this no

207
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,680
what is related to the difficulty because

208
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,680
these 20 mined blocks with a certain

209
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
cadence and after we will see how

210
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
often they are mined but  to maintain, let's say,

211
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
a target of a certain number of seconds in

212
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
which blocks are mined which is more or

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,070
less the same as I would leave it

214
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,380
could

215
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,579
increase or decrease over

216
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,070
time it is necessary to adjust this

217
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,839
difficulty as it is not related precisely

218
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,040
to the difficulty and to find a

219
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,149
solve that first magno mathematician

220
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,540
we were talking about well

221
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,829
here to go into a little detail

222
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,750
we will not see all this is a little

223
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,300
more in the d  I detail how

224
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,279
the indie tearoom biopsy works what we are

225
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,930
interested in knowing what it is that

226
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,880
inside the headers there are

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,260
precisely a trio of marco others in which one is

228
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,310
the world state re which represents a

229
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,010
meeting between

230
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,740
addresses and a series of values  of

231
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,180
these belonging to this address,

232
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,310
as you can imagine, we have the

233
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,949
balance ok which contains the amount

234
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:02,190
of heather ittiri contained for that

235
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,350
address and then after that it is something that

236
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,579
interests us we have some

237
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,660
very part storage and ruth which

238
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,940
contains the memory storage of our

239
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,319
smartphone  3 that interests us for

240
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,779
our smart contrast ok then we

241
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,790
also have transaction trite contains all

242
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,130
the transactions and returns 3 which contains

243
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,319
the out camp of these transactions

244
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,149
ok just more or less to make it clear

245
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,600
just briefly let's see for a moment the

246
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,940
difference between the bitcoin tyrants  now

247
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,769
first of all the team what

248
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,620
basically so is a machine

249
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,579
then we will see deterministic and it is a

250
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,959
machine that tries to  find a

251
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,940
consensus around the state of a

252
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,250
computer while bitcoin served to

253
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,069
obtain an agreement on the vice state of

254
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,810
a spreadsheet ok so they are two

255
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,079
slightly different things

256
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,940
we have a block every 12 seconds

257
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,250
while bitcoin and every 10 minutes

258
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,800
this on average

259
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,690
bitcoin at the site of the  block fixed one

260
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,839
megabyte while tir hume has a limit

261
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,040
given by gas limit then we will talk about the gas

262
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,500
exactly

263
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,540
and we have the creation of units of bit

264
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,699
cody and shot while we have 21 million

265
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:17,920
maximum bitcoins

266
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,779
each transaction includes a fip

267
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,639
only that while in bitcoin it is

268
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,980
independent of the  mount the fis with

269
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,370
irium depends on there on the

270
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,529
computational complexity of the smart contrast for

271
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,410
example that we are going to run both

272
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,120
using the prof work

273
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,649
interesting thing that interests us when

274
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,839
we will then talk about the virtual machine

275
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,420
or this computer that is used

276
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,670
by the shots is that the virtual machine  dei

277
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,160
tir is almost after we will see why tour

278
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,230
incomplete what tour

279
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,880
incom means  pleti practically that allows you to

280
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,329
execute

281
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,130
program transaction commands that are not necessarily

282
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,949
going to end ok this

283
00:11:57,949 --> 00:11:59,089
as you imagine can be a problem

284
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,589
in the sense that as we will see after the

285
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,449
shooting virtual machine and also single

286
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,250
thread and therefore it would block

287
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,680
everything for  this is the concept of the

288
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,420
gas

289
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,980
for what is the gas and what is that

290
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,990
block limits ligas limit because

291
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,399
within a block the limit of the

292
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,740
block given by things is given by the maximum

293
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,190
number of gases where the gas is a '

294
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,810
particular unit that depends on the shots a

295
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,569
cost however is therefore that the

296
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,709
maximum that we say limits the amount

297
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:30,589
of computation that is inside the

298
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:32,060
block for the transactions must be

299
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,388
followed

300
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,560
ok let's get to the point of

301
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,760
actually seeing how smart contrast also works

302
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,100


303
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,139
so first of all

304
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,730
what it is and shot in fundamentally

305
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,930
we can give different explanations

306
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,660
but it is shot but it is a

307
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,269
deterministic machine a machine state ok

308
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,399
machine  states then we will see what is

309
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,380
meant deterministic what does it

310
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,970
mean it means that since it is a

311
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,500
distributed system on which everyone must

312
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,990
agree it is necessary that there are no

313
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,939
differences between what

314
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,560
one car performs and another at the

315
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,750
bus level  so it's all about giving me nistic

316
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,310
and this also potentially involves

317
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,590
problems

318
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,600
from a slightly more

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,510
practical and shooting perspective but obviously open source

320
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,670
and it's like a huge

321
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,070
distributed computer ok and what are always live

322
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,380
applications are applications that

323
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,170
are usually based for  most

324
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,900
on the tir hume network and they are a set of

325
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,790
these smart contrast smartphones 3

326
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,740
what they are as we will see better

327
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,570
are programs that are deplored on

328
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,520
some addresses of brussels and that

329
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,270
are run

330
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,580
let's see for a moment how this

331
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,030
machine works so we have

332
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,590
basically  we have the state of

333
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,880
this machine of this virtual

334
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,950
machine that its storage and then have  mo

335
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,960
of the transactions that bring this

336
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,030
state to a subsequent state

337
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,020
obviously as seen before these

338
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,290
transactions are not single but are

339
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,100
grouped within a single

340
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,890
block so we will actually have that you

341
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,170
pass from one state to another because there

342
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,490
are more internal transactions than  a

343
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,560
block these are all executed and

344
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,870
bring the state from a state and once there

345
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,800
was a time tp1

346
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
so basically I shoot but it can

347
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,730
be seen as a chain of states and

348
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,530
each node must seek consensus

349
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,750
with respect to this world state one of

350
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,280
those marco others  that we have seen before

351
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,550
the clarification those 3 mar coltri that

352
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,160
we have seen before are not saved

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,740
on the brussels but are saved

354
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,550
locally by the individual nodes

355
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,620
and are basically saved in

356
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,070
databases

357
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,960
ok

358
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,910
which are the objects engines that we

359
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,250
are most important

360
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,180
in  this global status are the accounts

361
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,530
if you remember earlier we talked about

362
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,350
the world of the world day trip these

363
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,470
accounts can  be of two types

364
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,750
we have the so-called external omd

365
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,160
account

366
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,700
eva and we have the contract account what is

367
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,030
the difference is that these are now

368
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,430
controlled by a private key and

369
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,310
have no code associated with them

370
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,130
jehovah are the ones you use when

371
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,340
you want to mentally send some value  to

372
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,750
another address on the csen dt room

373
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,380
while we also counterattacks him a

374
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,360
tea the contract accounts

375
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,900
there are addresses that are also

376
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,020
the same always have the same

377
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,370
shape on brussels in which, however, as

378
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,440
we said before they also have a

379
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
part let's say of memory and  they have the

380
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,510
difference that these contrada accounts

381
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,830
are not controlled by a

382
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,410
private key but are controlled by this

383
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,810
code of this contract

384
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,990
another important aspect what it is is that

385
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,790
the smartphone 3 of the let's say

386
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,450
contract code is not executed by itself

387
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,830
maybe you can imagine that there  are all

388
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,180
these smartphones from on blondett

389
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,120
irium and these smart contrasts continue

390
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
to run  ito one after the other

391
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,220
continuously

392
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,070
no the smart contri that are executed

393
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,670
only if there is a transaction that

394
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,700
must basically start from one or

395
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,580
that trigger a let's say the code that

396
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,300
is executed ok basic otherwise

397
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,800
the smartphone three is not executed by

398
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,069
only

399
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,180
then do we have this global computer

400
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,770
we were talking about before

401
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,630
what is a virtual machine a virtual

402
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,760
machine that can be assimilated maybe

403
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,010
many of you already know how

404
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,780
java works or that there is a virtual

405
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,920
machine and it is necessary to feed

406
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,390
this virtual machine  of the code that is

407
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,490
able to understand

408
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,750
the smart cons and then we will see they are

409
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,520
written in an object-oriented language that

410
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,220
is called solidity is not the only place

411
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,020
we will also see others but let's say 90

412
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,839
percent 95 percent and this solidity that

413
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,900
is compiled by a compiler of

414
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,200
usually to the members a bytecode who is the

415
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,940
one most interpreted by this i throws

416
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,459
a virtual machine

417
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,569
so basically these

418
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,399
transactions what they do

419
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,640
ways  ficano make us run on the tir and a

420
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,260
virtual machine of

421
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,230
smart contract transactions and

422
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,030
we say the associated storage is updated this

423
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,670
huge computer ok

424
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,650
as I said before this virtual

425
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,470
machine is almost incomplete because in

426
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,370
reality to prevent these

427
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,980
smartcontrols run indefinitely there

428
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,380
it is a concept that you love gas as

429
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,380
I told you before that it is not a currency that

430
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,420
you can buy but it is associated with

431
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,640
teams you buy it with and you pull a when you make

432
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,770
a transaction

433
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,380
and for each command that is executed at

434
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,060
low level by the virtual machine there is

435
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,649
an associated  cost in gas

436
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,970
what happens that when there

437
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,070
is also an infinite loop or something

438
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,310
that does not end because at each command

439
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,140
executed it is lowered let's say the

440
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,080
number of this gas gas has a cost you

441
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,150
understand well that at a certain moment

442
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,770
this gas ends also because  then

443
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,820
inside the block we have a

444
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,740
maximum gas and so what happens in that

445
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,690
case that the transition the transaction

446
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,180
does a revert  this is an

447
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,650
interesting concept because if it comes in handy

448
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,110
later for an attack that happened

449
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,150
then in fact we could go on

450
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,710
up to a certain point by point there is a

451
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,450
loop the transaction goes back as

452
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,200
if it were not executed

453
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,910
and this is the reason why we say

454
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,040
the  machine sufficient says almost turin

455
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,370
complete

456
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,230
what is a decentralized application

457
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,600
said before basically what it is is

458
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,010
a set of smart contracts

459
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,170
year are applications these agreements

460
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,330
application maybe someone is already you

461
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,370
know it for example have you ever heard

462
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,830
unisu hoc or that it is a platform

463
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,280
of  decentralized exchange or

464
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,660
another that you have probably heard

465
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,340
that an application and open

466
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,810
city open to enter is used for the

467
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,210
dnf marketplace you are these so-called non-fungible touches

468
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,250


469
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,260
but they are let's say on the appearance of

470
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,840
normal applications ok they have a front

471
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,180
end is a backhand cos  'is the peculiarity

472
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,490
that the back end, however, are these

473
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,840
smartphones because we do not have the

474
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,190
usual ar  chitettura conservero me we have

475
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,340
these smart contracts

476
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,960
and

477
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,820
we interact on these decentralized

478
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,730
applications through transactions

479
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,200
that are executed as I

480
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,200
said before by these and or in practice

481
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,930
what happens that at least at

482
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,950
present there are browser plugins

483
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,020
of which the  more famous is called meta mask

484
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,970
which are a sort of wallet that

485
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,100
contain private keys and that

486
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,980
allow you to send to sign

487
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,440
transactions and then to launch

488
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,730
transactions to these existing to the

489
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,760
application then we also have

490
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,600
javascript libraries such as web 3.6 s et  to

491
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,490
point gs that are used by

492
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,280
our front end that allow us

493
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,570
this instead of interacting directly

494
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,600
with the blog chain of e tir youm ok

495
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,340
then these two libraries interact

496
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,410
with the burn in dt rom and how they do it

497
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,530
with the support of a role that  wants

498
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,970
are nothing more than a collection of

499
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,590
private and public keys but with the private ones you

500
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,990
stop the transactions  and then

501
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,070
the transactions are performed in this way

502
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,610


503
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,810
this just to give an idea of the diffe

504
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,830
ence between web2 web 3 we have front end a

505
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,510
d the particularity, if anything, of the centr

506
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,770
l application which is not essen

507
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,980
ial but often this is the case is that 

508
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,840
lso the front end and i

509
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,150
centralized you see them that I have

510
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,550
inserted something called ip fs which

511
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,310
would stand for interplanetary file system

512
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,550
and is a platform that allows it to

513
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,740
load resources anyway apart from the

514
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,940
front end in a decentralized way

515
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,340
too

516
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,540
or for example, for example, the

517
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,460
images you find  the nfp

518
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,530
are typically loaded in these ways in this

519
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,630
way here they are not loaded on a vs for

520
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,030
example

521
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,590
the match then true what is

522
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,940
the back end part or that the back

523
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,370
end part we have smart contracts

524
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,840
instead of the server architecture  and this

525
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,750
changes the game a lot on our part too

526
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,950
that we are going to test this

527
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,100
application

528
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,950
this is a nice

529
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,570
diagram that I found at the site you

530
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,920
see in  low that practically

531
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,990
shows what the flow of a

532
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,370
transaction is now the ice

533
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,280
application enters from the moment you click

534
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,620
command is what happens let's try to

535
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,510
see it I had to split it in two so

536
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,890
the part below ends up there

537
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,260
this is a  example of an application

538
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,260
that trivially allows you to vote

539
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,840
via blog there is

540
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,130
so what happens

541
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,540
we click on the vote on

542
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,960
the web page there is a javascript that

543
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,040
uses heather js you can point gs

544
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,960
generates a transaction that is signed

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,540
by  our wallet as usually for

546
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,360
example is half born

547
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,910
this transaction

548
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,350
arrives via the internet to a local full nov

549
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,500
because it happens we must be able to

550
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,270
talk to at least one node of the network

551
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,990
then that single node of the network

552
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,780
what does there are gossip protocols

553
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,430
that allow  to distribute this

554
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,770
message to other known people on the network but

555
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,910
at the beginning we are able to talk

556
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,990
to someone

557
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,390
the cases are or you have one locally

558
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,580
on the dt room case it is very onerous or

559
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,020
otherwise we rely on some services

560
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,120
such as for example alchemy measure that

561
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,139
make this passage here

562
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
validated transaction is propagated to a

563
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,980
pind sooner or later arrives at a

564
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,150
northern mining that decides to collect it the

565
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,650
mine then after it comes  distributed to

566
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,550
other full north that validate it ok and

567
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,340
when it is validated there are these

568
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,840
the central and application that with

569
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,150
javascript are listening for eventer

570
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,550
the events that are launched if you

571
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,930
remember from the beginning we saw that

572
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,970
there was a re  sit 3 who takes care of the

573
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,010
car with the transaction are

574
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,840
these decentralized applications that

575
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,100
are waiting for these lenses and

576
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,090
then respond by saying ok you have voted for

577
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,379
the ride to this type

578
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,870
ok finally we arrive as a

579
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,780
smart contract actually

580
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,100
first of all the language used for 90

581
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,400
for one hundred this solidity an object

582
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,390
formation language there are also

583
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,360
others or less used some even a little

584
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,590
more one more  low level, however, in the meantime

585
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,750
we allow ourselves on the usual that 95

586
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,390
percent of smart contact

587
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,560
we see for a moment as the fact you see

588
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,000
that there is a keyword contract which is

589
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,640
the equivalent of a keyword class ok

590
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,770
began

591
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,810
and then we have modifiers that go to

592
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,150
modify  possibly the

593
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,210
behavior of the functions

594
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,529
we have some classic functions an

595
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,809
interesting thing maybe you don't know that

596
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,130
there is the one that now together with peia ball

597
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,110
what Europeans fly means that

598
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,740
that method

599
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,299
accepts them some money

600
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,890
ok can actually receive

601
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,750
hetero this to a whole series  of

602
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,929
implications

603
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,409
one of the reasons why this is a

604
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:43,940
very interesting sector also from

605
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,450
our side of security is because

606
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,940
as you can imagine there is

607
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,200
a lot of money and therefore

608
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
any security problem is not

609
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,409
a trivial matter but can result in

610
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:00,889
several millions lost one of the sectors

611
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,120
so they are the most popular of

612
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,470
smartphones among is that of define

613
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,760
perhaps you have never already heard it  o

614
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,179
de fayed and central light finance takes

615
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:09,409
care we take a sector that

616
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,750
practically deals with moving the web

617
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,480
3 on the blue china here all those services

618
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,279
that would be banking so for example

619
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,590
the

620
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,850
loan stacking borrow

621
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,190
etc.

622
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,090
here they are fundamental of

623
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,450
recent 3d smartphones  you see that

624
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,549
value locke cake and it has reached 74

625
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:31,340
billion dollars it means that at this

626
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,490
moment about 74 billion dollars are stuck in these

627
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,510
smart contracts

628
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,399
so you can imagine

629
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,289
the damage and then we will see some that

630
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,789
can cause these 3

631
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,029
misused smartphones or if  you go put some

632
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:48,679
apple de fi money without

633
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,760
actually knowing what you are doing

634
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,080
you have analyzed the code

635
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,720
ok now we see the risks of ismar

636
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
contact actually

637
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,799
we have very peculiar characteristics

638
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,350
in smart contracts that

639
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,510
therefore require a

640
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,980
totally different approach than the classic one

641
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,690


642
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,169
first of all  the code

643
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,090
of these smartp is important  hone ter is public or

644
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,100
semi-public and I remind you that the

645
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,510
smartphone three are the back end of

646
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,490
your applications and therefore this

647
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,070
is already very different this because because the

648
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,559
code is on the blog chain and

649
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,049
some blogs in explorer of with a

650
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,529
famous is never resist  'tres cannes where you

651
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:32,390
can go and see if nothing else

652
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,500
ecodem which can be as you imagine

653
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,670
reported to the original code at least more

654
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,550
or less or very often for smartphones

655
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,650
among those that require more trust

656
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,450
we have the real code this

657
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,740
because because they are

658
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,530
verification modes that make

659
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,320
me tell you that my smartcontrol is

660
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,150
that bytecode I also put the code

661
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,620
next to you to say look that the two things

662
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,320
match many do so and

663
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,060
basically it makes sense to do so so keep in mind

664
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,040
that the code your smartphones  3 and

665
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,020
public another aspect that of

666
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,470
immutability once you have

667
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,190
deplored the breach in a

668
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,990
smartphone trek you can no longer

669
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,870
change things c  he you can do is

670
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,900
rock it or possibly make an upgrade

671
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,900
but you understand that it is however this series of

672
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,670
operations have an increasingly

673
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,990
higher cost depending on how

674
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,460
complex the smartphone break is also

675
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,770
so you also understand the criticality from

676
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,050
a company point of view also from

677
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,580
point of view of the money precisely that

678
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,130
are at stake for operations of this type

679
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,980
in addition many smart contracts

680
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,300
allow access by other smartphones

681
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,310
including this perhaps even in the web world but it

682
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,370
is particularly common and this brings

683
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,479
a whole series of problems

684
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,170
this is a  nice site that I treat

685
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,060
ancona nice and we are at the rack news point

686
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,990
this is a site that collects in order

687
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,240
of lost money most of the

688
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,400
attacks that have been there so far

689
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,900
in the world let's say smart contract

690
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,640
as you see first this is also

691
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,410
quite recent ronin network that

692
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,790
belongs to a game called xvi

693
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,110
infiniti because there is also a whole world

694
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,720
of gaming on the blog chain lost states

695
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
eq  equivalent to 624 million for oneself what

696
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,160
is meant could be either lost

697
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,050
because they were stolen or as often

698
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,030
happens they are blocked in smart

699
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,860
contracts and there is no way to

700
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,810
unlock these funds that

701
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,250
actually remain there are nobody's but

702
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,310
cannot be obtained

703
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,270
you see  also next to it that there is written to

704
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,480
nodes and some cases or tickets because

705
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,070
many of these contracts of or someone

706
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,440
else not many were also or of

707
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,110
tati ok I said it means stepping on

708
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,980
these smartcontrols more than therefore also

709
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,510
doing the tests of this kind of

710
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,370
application is a considerable risk

711
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,630
because it could turn out that you have it

712
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,010
or data and 600 million have been lost

713
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,419
here are other very famous attack of a

714
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,370
few years ago in which someone

715
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,280
posted on kitab saying to iasi den 3

716
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,809
dec the deet is there  someone who

717
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,059
practically to whom side a smart

718
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,640
contract

719
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,530
by blocking a total of 513 thousand heather

720
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,059
that now you do the math but a

721
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,400
heather is worth

722
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,580
just under 2,000 dollars and how is it c  he it

723
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,960
happened this happened because

724
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,230
there was a library used by

725
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,450
many wallets

726
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,610
this person here he says he bit

727
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,010
fiddling managed to be and

728
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,360
become loughner of this smart

729
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,160
contrast and at that point he decided

730
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,860
well to call it a killer function this

731
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,910
gem function that  he

732
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,760
destroys everything and the smartphone because he

733
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,840
does not transfer

734
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,030
these funds anywhere and therefore that money has

735
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,360
remained blocked

736
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,059
ok so to tell you how much all this is at the

737
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,770
beginning and this is a

738
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,520
project among other things parity wallet

739
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,200
founded in collaboration with Dr.

740
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,880
greenwood who is one of the two or three

741
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,320
inventors of the peaks of and you pull one

742
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,450
together with bute ring ok so not the

743
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,240
first come

744
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,970
ok now let's see some

745
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,720
actual attack that happened against the

746
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,370
smart compact here are real cases

747
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,700
this represents in april 2022 c  It

748
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,760
was a so-called Dutch auction are

749
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,730
these

750
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,410
Dutch auctions that work a particular way

751
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,059
a little particular because there is a ba  if

752
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,450
at auction in this case it was if I remember

753
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,850
correctly it was 5 shots one thing also a little

754
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,250
high room and over time

755
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,630
this was down

756
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,500
and this tender thing a bit particular

757
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,309
because practically what it said said

758
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,750
that the lower price then  it stops and

759
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,480
what will be true for everyone if you want to

760
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,650
lie here it was a question of mounting

761
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,460
ftp years and in the meantime, however, all of

762
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,830
you have to bid, let's say a bid an offer and

763
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,799
then in case they will be returned to you if

764
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,810
then in the end you have not won you

765
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,610
will be returned to you  these these

766
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,560
offers

767
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,170
what is it that actually

768
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,000
11,500 teams have been leased

769
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,590
now let's see exactly what

770
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,730
happened

771
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,190
so much I anticipate that this here was

772
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,560
a so-called griffin gattaca griffin

773
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,510
guetta what they are are attacks

774
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,400
that are a kind of denial  of service

775
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,100
in the sense that they are attacks in which

776
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,710
the attacker has no advantage but

777
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,210
the disadvantage is that all the

778
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,400
others have the leased funds ok so a

779
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,480
disturbance  rather heavy

780
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,800
we have a function next to being fans

781
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,090
that takes care of this re fund

782
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,810
and you see inside that we have a

783
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,680
cycle four that deals in progression

784
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,330
to go and do the re fund of the

785
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,000
offers made

786
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,090
and I put a heather scan site point in

787
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,200
which at that address you can

788
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,970
actually then go and see the

789
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,820
code that was actually there this is

790
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,200
a blog jane explorer of what

791
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I was talking about before

792
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,400
what is the problem the problem

793
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,160
within that for loop

794
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,650
why why if you used this

795
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,310
smartcontrol was a neo a unique

796
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,200
external a from cannes we were talking about

797
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,450
before there would be no problem the

798
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,850
first what is it that in this case here they

799
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,650
could also offer

800
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:20,040
smart contracts and what happens

801
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,150
let's go for a moment to see this cycle

802
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,070
for this  for loop goes through

803
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,280
one offer after another

804
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,810
then you see towards a goal that you find

805
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,520
that big data point bitter point with the

806
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,130
old re fund that is the call that is

807
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,550
effective  mind does the re fund

808
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,780
ok we see the attacker's contract

809
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,950
what happens that when

810
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,230
the re fund is made so

811
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,340


812
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,560
ater is actually sent all the attacker is the attacker

813
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,240
represented by a contract the

814
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,890
contract can receive money as

815
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,930
who receives this money are full

816
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,300
backs in which in this case trouble the

817
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,010
rest that you see you see that pay hubble

818
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,130
because he can receive money

819
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,630
that as implemented implemented in

820
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,460
such a way that there is practically an infinite loop

821
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,710


822
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,490
ok

823
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,980
so what is it that happens  I ca

824
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,140
n't go back it

825
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,240
happens that this attacker has made

826
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,160
this offer with his smart contract

827
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,280
after about ninety minutes and

828
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,600
therefore all those who have made

829
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
an offer after him

830
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,650
have never received their money back

831
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,170
because because at the moment in which

832
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,510
the king fund was made to

833
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,320
the attacker the attacker with his ford who

834
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,809
received the money

835
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,750
but sent in the loop against the

836
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,120
original contract which  and the so-

837
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,520
called out off gas was therefore the

838
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,260
concept I was talking about before and therefore practically

839
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,570
this money is leased because no one

840
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,360
could then after going carli the thing

841
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,800
between really funny what is that

842
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,260
this attacker here was actually an

843
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,600
ethical hacker wanted to demonstrate this

844
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,760
vulnerability here  but as you can see there was

845
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,170
also let's say a block is equal to true

846
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,580
that could be set perhaps to

847
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,770
free this money what we say

848
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,240
funny thing is that when

849
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,770
he tried to do it the original smart contract

850
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,380
was written so badly that in

851
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,580
reality there is  there were other problems for which

852
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,199
I was not able to return

853
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,800
this money anyway and this one to which these aq

854
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,168
dreams of this action here have

855
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,300
collected millions of money for it

856
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,949
have effects so we have a lot of

857
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,830
funds there were in short not the first

858
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,340
arrived ok and they found  a

859
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,770
big problem of this type

860
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,000
now we see the other attacks which

861
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,590
are two attacks that are mostly

862
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,359
traits  from demo exercises

863
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,710
but we talk about how to say even

864
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,879
real attacks also refer to

865
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,668
real attacks example the first is so

866
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:43,199
to the so-called re-enter in attacks

867
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,690
this is a famous attack is a

868
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,369
famous type of attack because

869
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:50,210
because in 2016 it is the one that caused

870
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,219
the famous forks between the trucks and the shots a

871
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,080
classic was

872
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,480
60 million dollars but present at the

873
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,670
time but there were many more the two

874
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,200
practically what it is that is made it is

875
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,940
made a fort of the original chain

876
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,650
to return the money they had been

877
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,600
lost due to this hack that used

878
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,460
this technique

879
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,810
what is the technique of the interested king

880
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,310
which technique is that we have a contract a

881
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,310
which typically in the way of money and after

882
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,620
newspapers balances its balance which

883
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,990
goes to call a contract b and how is it that

884
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,330
it  calls calls him because when

885
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,610
the money is sent the money is sent

886
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,590
to the attacker the attacker

887
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,260
uses this fall back function

888
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,560
to do what to return

889
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,450
to the  calling function that withdraws the

890
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,670
money before the balance is updated

891
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,390
trivially

892
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,180
so this is an example of a

893
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,760
vulnerable contract you see below that we have

894
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,880
the wii draw in which if we have enough

895
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,130
balance what happens that the

896
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,800
one with the first is sent that the

897
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,800
money is sent  that you want the user would like to

898
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,010
withdraw and then at the end he sees the

899
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,720
balance message point sander fine-

900
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,450
tuning sander who actually effects

901
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,310
the transaction who calls this smart

902
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,770
contract that decreases its

903
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,270
balance the program that this does it

904
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,790
after and therefore that  what happens what happens

905
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,620
we can the

906
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,300
attacker's contract we have this

907
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,000
function attack that first deposit

908
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,160
money

909
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,220
and then what we do until

910
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,960
after he calls the cole he finds with the book

911
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,970
what he does it says as long as there is some

912
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,930
balance in the  contract the original one

913
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,510
I do the wii draw of my funds

914
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,920
that I donated before so surely

915
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,830
I have them but then if you see  the rest

916
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,180
we have the shape that draws again

917
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,220
with him draw so every time the

918
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,470
first time he sends me the money I

919
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,150
call and my shape arrives and he

920
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,190
calls me back with the glass so

921
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,020
what is it that happens that balance

922
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,060
marshall  sander minus equal to mount

923
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,760
is only done at the end and in

924
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,440
this way I manage to plunder spreads

925
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,780
the original contract

926
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,760
because this this thing is done

927
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,650
at the end trivial fix of something

928
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,200
like that what is it to put that

929
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,410
subtraction before

930
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,759
the call is actually made  of woodrow

931
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,780
here we have a small video that we see

932
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,570
that first we fill out

933
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,370
the contract the original one this is

934
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:32,200
remix which is an ide web

935
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,460
then what happens we put 4 hectares

936
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,869
on the original contract which then will be the

937
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,430
ones we are going to steal in

938
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,869
quotes we deploy on the

939
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,099
block chain this is all done the

940
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,730
club we catch the

941
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,609
smartphone thief 38 original we

942
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:49,740
deplore the attacker's contract

943
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,940
and praise we try co  n a connection

944
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,250
with respect to the original one

945
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,750
at this point what do we do we go to

946
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,650
donate to call it tac donating it for

947
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,849
what happens that for what has been

948
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,609
said before

949
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,200
we see how the current balance of the

950
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,000
attacker is 5 then four plus

951
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,119
one he had given and the bar instead  the

952
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,190
original contract is zero so

953
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,589
by doing so we took all the funds

954
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:16,690
from the original contract on this

955
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,420
what happened in 2016 which led to

956
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,210
this much discussed hard folk dt room to

957
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,460
somehow return the funds to those

958
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,930
who had lost them this happened because it

959
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,280
was  at the beginning then after it no longer

960
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,079
happened so keep in mind that

961
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,910
this operation

962
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,509
will hardly be redone

963
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,810
another attack that interesting to

964
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,180
see concerns

965
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,420
overflow and underfloor

966
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,950
solidity is a low-level language

967
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,140
and also clashes with the fact that this

968
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,569
and virtual machine pull

969
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:54,040
to limited sky storage ok to

970
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,490
memory slots that are usually 32 bytes

971
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,380
supports sound and unsigned

972
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,869
inte  gra and then what is it that happens

973
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:02,760
trivially

974
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,579
happens this is an example with 28

975
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,750
that when we are at

976
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:15,069
255 a plus 1 brings it back 0 ok and this

977
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,960
imagine that it also happens with

978
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,359
an inter 256 256 1 return to zero and

979
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,670
vice versa  what interests us most

980
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,170
of the time what in this case are

981
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,060
underfloor problems or the

982
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,560
opposite from zero maybe it goes to 255 or

983
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,700
from zero if it reaches from two to 256

984
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,130
let's see a concrete case

985
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,490
this is a vulnerable contract

986
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,710
these last two are taken  examples from

987
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,330
an application of exercises that you can

988
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,550
find online both never for nout this

989
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,780
case to the objective what it was that

990
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,430
this original contract had 20

991
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,350
tokens let's say 20 shots

992
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,790
you have to find a way to

993
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,700
get even more

994
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,040
how it works we have  this

995
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,320
transfer and you see the first line which is

996
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,360
that king quark what it is like it

997
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,190
was a block that says ok to go

998
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,450
on this condition must be

999
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,850
respected

1000
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,619
bance majesty cue sander less is valid

1001
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,490
it must be greater than zero

1002
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:28,330
what the point is the point is that if the

1003
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,220
balance of the month point if it will go events

1004
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,880
for example and we our value that

1005
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,470
we then go to call from the attacker and

1006
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:39,220
21 20 minus 21 of sodium would be negative

1007
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,440
in this case  here he would like a number

1008
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,810
let's say two to 256 that clearly

1009
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,000
greater than or equal to zero and then passes

1010
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,450
that first line there

1011
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,859
the problem what is that in addition to changing

1012
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:52,270
that rigali and also changes the

1013
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,850
next banas tuning sander

1014
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,260
less equal to mount becomes a

1015
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,030
very value  high lasts 256

1016
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,880
so we have this actually not

1017
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,050
met the attacker this is

1018
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,490
another way I had solved

1019
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,130
the exercise in the sense that we have seen

1020
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,470
before remix which is an idea that

1021
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,500
allows you to automate and simplify

1022
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,460
these tests

1023
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,310
otherwise this is  another system

1024
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,570
we are hard app that allows you to

1025
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,160
carry out tests to simulate these

1026
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,780
transactions these are in time script

1027
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,619
but basically what is it what happens it

1028
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,340
happens that I who  i love la transfer with

1029
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,869
21 tokens and as said before

1030
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:38,590
20 minus 21 under flow becomes 2 to 256 the

1031
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,660
king quar passes and plus i can

1032
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,960
get a lot of tok hun

1033
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,410
this a little

1034
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,900
video where i simply launch this dar

1035
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,680
test date

1036
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,550
see attacker  point balance this

1037
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,920
infinite number practically all

1038
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,380
this because because there was a before

1039
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,420
going flow

1040
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,530
I see I miss two minutes so I

1041
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,540
take advantage of it the slides would be over but

1042
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,970
I tell you another one

1043
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,960
that is particular that can be

1044
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,570
interesting is the fact that the shots  but

1045
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,849
a deterministic machine this

1046
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:20,740
entails problems of what kind for

1047
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,230
example if we were to create

1048
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,690
applications that need to

1049
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,890
have some random cites me it

1050
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,690
is a huge problem that

1051
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,089
of getting random cites me in a

1052
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:37,030
deterministic system and many bugs happen

1053
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,060
precisely for this  reason

1054
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,390
why because usually at least the

1055
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,490
past times not so past

1056
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,930
used primitives that are

1057
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,270
for example the times tempo il blo  cco

1058
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,270
etcetera which however could be

1059
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,950
somehow modified by a

1060
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,470
malevolent miner ok so they were used

1061
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,910
in reality it would not be used

1062
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,310
because they could be modified

1063
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,570
so this what it is that implies that

1064
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,460
many of the solutions involve the use

1065
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,849
of the so-called oracles oracles which are

1066
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,589
of the systems that somehow

1067
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:11,040
provide data of chen

1068
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,119
to the stage block otherwise it

1069
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,220
would not have as you can imagine

1070
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,109
something you also have a chain is that

1071
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:19,150
these same oracles if there is a problem

1072
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,250
on these oracles here we could have

1073
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,290
data that smash the rest of the

1074
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,660
transactions and here we say

1075
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,900
a whole other interesting world opens

1076
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,400
I hope it was interesting thanks for your

1077
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,900
attention

1078
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:38,880
