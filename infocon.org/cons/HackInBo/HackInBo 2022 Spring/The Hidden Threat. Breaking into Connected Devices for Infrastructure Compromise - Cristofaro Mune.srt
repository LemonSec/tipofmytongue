1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,590
I have to say what you do ok no

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,720
well

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,370
here first of all thank you for

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,290
the patience for waiting then I

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,550
am cristoforo I am with the bottom the

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,090
slide today we will have fun talking about

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,759
what threads that can

8
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,780
bring the devices within

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,730
any infrastructure  and how they can

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,010
be used for the compromise

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,500
of the entire structure itself

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,650
so before his return tuckson

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,610
substantially who I am in reality I

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,220
have been working in the

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,690
security field for 15 years I have been dealing with

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,880
dialysis of safety devices so

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,410
everything  it concerns hardware

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,630
actually i am a co founder relizane

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,600
a company based in holland

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,860
specializes in devices the experts what

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,069
we take care of everything i wanted

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,080
if the boot class are in byron mint

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,909
we make strong injection attacks we

24
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,159
have fun doing some  things of a

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,219
low level so today we will take a

26
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,399
trip precisely more than anything else on how the

27
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:18,810
vulnerabilities of the various of various it

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,899
can  be used in

29
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,210
a slightly different context if you want to know more

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,289
than our research

31
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,569
you have to go to the site there is a lot of

32
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,670
stuff in short, I hope today's purposes will be of

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,319
interest

34
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,060
but

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,100
we would like to discuss the security

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,649
of today's modern devices for the

37
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,590
simple fact  that devices

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,990
are often not often seen as

39
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,880
endpoints instead I believe that at the end of

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,770
this talk I hope so at least we will begin

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,579
to consider them as endpoints

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,789
above all I would like to show some

43
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,439
traits that they could introduce at

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,170
this point of course I would also like to

45
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,149
evaluate the impact and us  are two scenarios

46
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,219
of critical importance in my opinion at

47
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,200
the moment which are security interfaces

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,959
and critical infrastructures

49
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,729
obviously for reasons

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,430
that are also well understood that go beyond

51
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,140
the normal concern to

52
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,459
introduce criticisms present in this

53
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,290
historical period

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,450
obviously seen in short, no of

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,730
something  different from the usual pc servers

56
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,329
and network security it

57
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,230
would also be the case to

58
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,500
verify our practices of hg seacure.it

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,409
then they are effective in this area and

60
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,569
therefore basically I would like to

61
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,000
share some observations

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
that come from my

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,900
background my word experience seacure.it

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,489
where we deal with  holy to

65
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,260
improve the devices before they

66
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,169
are even placed on the market or

67
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,700
even later when you are there

68
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,280
charlie I think that some of these

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,079
observations can actually

70
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,930
help to use these devices

71
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,169
in real

72
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:59,010
enterprise areas and also the inter on

73
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,919
criticism at the end of this talk

74
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,590
that I would like there to be substantially more

75
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,569
ernest more awareness of what

76
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,459
these risks may be

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,319
then basically if at the end of

78
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,730
this talk you come out only somehow

79
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,620
amazed ok I'm happy but if

80
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,120
we all go out a little more

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,979
careful  then we are all happier

82
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,359
from this point of view then prim  or it was

83
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,760
a comparison between that the current

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,620
certain status of the hit the data on the uti with

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,959
what is instead the current state

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,090
of the vice seacure.it so

87
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,530
we will try to address

88
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,669
some differences between these two worlds

89
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,769
obviously I will explain two scenarios point

90
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,569
that  of the inter play gentlemen of the former

91
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,849
studio criticism and above all we will go to

92
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,680
perform some attacks that is that I will

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,340
show them live praying the famous goiter

94
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,430
and in any case they help us in all this is

95
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,799
what I will demonstrate they will only be of

96
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,739
vice based tags so in essence for

97
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,290
this  in fact I tried brought a couple

98
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,670
of us with me

99
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,160
I would like to show you some attacks or

100
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,200
at least evaluate them together

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,819
because I think there are opportunities

102
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,239
for reflection on these on what

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,910
I hope to show you these

104
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,079
appropriate reflections that

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,089
will normally be for prevention

106
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,149
revelations detection  mitigation

107
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,380
response are these famous four

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,290
points on which usually one sure of

109
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,110
places ran to  article

110
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,180
obviously we will not stop only at

111
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,440
this part here because in reality we will

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
scrutinize in this journey that the

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,100
gaps are much more complex

114
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,810
than what is often

115
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,169
considered and in my opinion there is

116
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,210
actually room for quite

117
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,580
particular attacks is

118
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,660
like saying  of yours at the end of the

119
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,820
talk maybe

120
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,750
obviously we will close with some

121
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,060
recommendations for observations some

122
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,250
considerations let's first make a

123
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,600
quick recapitalization and

124
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
basically of what was

125
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,310
some passages of the elect certain of

126
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,680
some important events I say them in no particular

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,389
order in reality because not

128
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,919
because they are more  important than others

129
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,140
simply because it cannot mark the

130
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,750
history and imagination of everyone

131
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,280
in reality we say proceeds the first

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,510
time we started talking

133
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,270
about safe computers summer to say at least

134
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,460
at the media level in some way it

135
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,070
was re-action  from morris swarm i

136
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,260
think a good part of the audience is

137
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,400
too young to re  cordarcelo it

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,699
was 1988 but let's say maybe an ep

139
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,520
moments in history in which the computer

140
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,720
sure of becomes a topic discuss

141
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,830
another important thing another

142
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,720
important event that the awareness

143
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,449
of security and began to grow a

144
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,860
certain point of view therefore also from the

145
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,680
side  defensive of some things for

146
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,539
example at 92 there was what will be

147
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,940
the first prototype the firewall vis bene

148
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,789
but substantially with its you

149
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,820
will live for has substantially proposed and

150
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,270
ways to be able to find packages directed

151
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,979
to the services

152
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:00,820
if only the  exposure

153
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,530
begins to become a little

154
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,690
more accessible phenomenon I think that all but

155
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,120
those who have made this type of

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,289
path

157
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,090
have at least taken a look at this

158
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,120
article and if you have not done it

159
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,970
obviously but the expenses shaun has

160
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,090
evolved to lead to which  precisely the

161
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,610
birth of some rules that turned the

162
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,699
internet upside down in 2001 I had the

163
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,110
luck and misfortune of being on the

164
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,060
defensive side was effects  vamente in the know that

165
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,210
we have immediately reality I have seen of a

166
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,520
verse a queue and riddles from all those

167
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,770
close so in short some

168
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,260
white hair there is another important step

169
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,110
in security and being when in 2002

170
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,039
microsoft that I will vote them anyway a

171
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,560
software giant as relevance

172
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,510
perhaps it was even more so than today in reality

173
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,060
in proportion that is there was windows point

174
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,880
is not that there was the other at that

175
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,280
moment

176
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
bill gates appropriation said that from

177
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,300
today we do seacure.it before the

178
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,550
features this is  it was a famous thousand

179
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,440
there are links the performance we are there

180
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,699
from going to see the sources the

181
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,979
information resources

182
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,690
usually after this journey of

183
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,789
the last 35 years and today we

184
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,500
find that light gentlemen

185
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,270
generally focuses on software

186
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,460
already basically we talk about

187
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,100
the  software aspects of

188
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,310
safety has evolved in all

189
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,750
these years in the context of the entire

190
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,090
principals now we are going to

191
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,849
see some of the fireplaces c  he reminds us

192
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,699
are linked to that to this story

193
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,410
and most

194
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,610
of the safety practices of ships were born in that area

195
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,319
we have acquired them we have acquired them in

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,080
this environment we have learned them

197
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,130
traveling and making mistakes in this

198
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,340
environment obviously we can talk there

199
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,580
are

200
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,410
possibilities in  various possible improvements have been made

201
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,810
for which the

202
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,099
software development has understood that it is necessary to

203
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,169
apply a group mode la secure

204
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,199
est different the concepts of fancy in depth

205
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,229
were born in these 35 years also

206
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,270
testing benevento roll out gay testing

207
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,909
all this to do  with the

208
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:09,979
prévention basically all these

209
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,380
things are there to avoid that

210
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,419
vulnerabilities may have been

211
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,430
exploited in the first case

212
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,960
we try to get them to avoid

213
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,699
giving them development and while the

214
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,740
underlying part tries to exploit them,

215
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,229
however it is always a discourse of

216
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,570
provence the next next

217
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,580
obviously by the friend seacure.it and beth

218
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,430
action  and here perhaps we have

219
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,010
many acronyms perhaps present more than

220
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,059
what we could find in many

221
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,729
songs.

222
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,679


223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,510


224
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,520


225
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,690
happens

226
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,180
after an attack has been successful

227
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,700
we have measures that reduce

228
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,100
the impact of this attack from

229
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,350
then we have learned a lot the

230
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,450
segregation in the networks the reduction of

231
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,790
privileges the sandboxing ladispoli

232

jackson

233
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,149
we have the vm scapes we have a lot of

234
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,800
these are  only examples in reality we

235
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,930
could cite present other 15 20 for

236
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,120
each single of these boxes is

237
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,850
precisely that the response appropriately being

238
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,110
software usually a patch first and

239
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,730
then maybe we think about the rest so

240
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,459
peace must be available

241
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,260
even bridge dreams do not have a

242
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,470
single  actually and there is a whole

243
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,029
series of other things that depend on the

244
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,880
context that is every context of the companies  oni

245
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,770
of the response that can make sense in

246
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,180
that context this is more or less what

247
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,720
we have learned in general

248
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,860
especially then there is the concept of

249
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,870
perimeters and diem point that has

250
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,399
accompanied us and accompanies us more and

251
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,350
more we have the safety factor of betim is

252
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,730
among  the first fifteen years

253
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,440
probably then began to think about the

254
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,170
endpoints which are these in points today

255
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,450
but today we are already beginning to reason

256
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,640
that routers can be big points and

257
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,410
routers at least the infrastructure the

258
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,149
firewalls themselves would like to be the

259
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,670
end points ok own sign  in

260
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,220
point also

261
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,950
its infrastructural and obviously

262
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,250
high security sony servers

263
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,600
are certainly very

264
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,640
important endpoints as well as possibly reserves

265
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,880
of summer operation in an area of lymph struc

266

ure many do precisely velotti netwo

267
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,589
k is even more important in quota

268
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,600
ion marks than the part  dt I wrote

269
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,610
operation in general to give an idea

270
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,040
that there is where it happens is gen  ered the

271
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,050
value or there is still the value to

272
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,820
be protected there are obviously the

273
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,980
clients we have the guests all these even

274
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,600
if these sony networks are

275
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,580
different security levels from which colors it

276
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,980
is more or less an idea that these

277
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,690
are the  end point we have to

278
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,120
discuss and all of us think we

279
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,730
agree enough only that in

280
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,850
my vision I think that some are missing

281
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,459
to date they

282
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,839
are missing in a deputy file usually

283
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,180
we can still do little

284
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,740
lack of teams that we add in

285
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,079
addition to the part  entire structural is a

286
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,420
neo device in the point you were missing

287
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,190
access all the wifi coverage area

288
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,740
are precisely the rivals in general the

289
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,700
printers the various Belgians laugh biometric

290
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,160
as well as webcam access control system ag

291
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,260
powerline control because maybe you

292
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,900
let the network pass on the lines of  current

293
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,150
and also goes to repeat itself

294
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,060
I believe that a good part of this audience I do not say

295
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,430
but

296
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,020
maybe a little more polite but

297
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,240
when it comes to adi point you think

298
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,190
to the first slide rather than this one

299
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,280
and therefore in my opinion, however, I think that

300
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,380
these realities can have their

301
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,690
merit in general

302
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,250
normally we or this stuff

303
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,880
we call it hardware in practice and

304
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,650
therefore you buy it a lot by the kilo you throw it a

305
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,990
lot by the kilo and the  it turns a lot by the

306
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,030
kilo

307
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,050
we call them weiss which are

308
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,760
complex because

309
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,310
software stalling don't come on that they are hard for

310
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,810
everything we love hardware reality

311
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,070
there is some small problem

312
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,930
probably like what loved me

313
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,370
hard for example the dvd

314
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,460
xbox player and we're talking about

315
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,370
i think 15 20 years ago

316
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,360
memories a little fuzzy

317
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,290
we have 5 million lines of code

318
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,010
they linux 3 1 that is found in many

319
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,650
of today's jars runs around 25

320
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,870
million lines of code

321
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,180
today a car a  about 100 million

322
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,640
lines of code to make you understand the

323
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,840
genome of a mouse has about 120

324
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,690
we are the complexity of lines of

325
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,440
code and almost those of an

326
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,750
animal genome so I challenge anyone to

327
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,480
call this  you hardware objects

328
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,700
basically a nice challenge of

329
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,140
course I try to remember it

330
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,050
throughout my experience

331
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,670
obviously there are those who say that we must

332
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,310
implicitly avoid being between stars and it is

333
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,050
also necessary to avoid calling it

334
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,480
hardware when it is not and this thing

335
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,700
that historically I am only  saying

336
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,930
that it is not the first time is the only one today

337
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,950
there are records around so

338
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,360
basically what many

339
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,010
call hardware could have more

340
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,839
lines of code than

341
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
someone expects in practice they are not

342
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,370
these devices besides having a lot of

343
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,260
software year in  some very

344
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,540
complex hardware and also very powerful if you

345
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,390
wanted to look at the top right

346
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,029
there are cortex a7 that are

347
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,800
much more powerful disabled you want than

348
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,950
what could be

349
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,350
I don't know a device of about 10 years ago

350
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,570
and so complex  this part here at

351
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,040
the hardware level and it is all increases

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,500
on the c comb here if you can open one of

353
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,410
these so inside it will have one of

354
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,209
these sy  stem on chip and then there is also

355
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,430
another thing that is important when I

356
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,110
bought a gap on this of who's vice

357
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,810
and

358
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,250
when I buy a pc it is usually yours

359
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,200
you have the hardware and the software

360
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,660
usually licensed but the  hardware is yours

361
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,180
when you buy a

362
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,700
phone asked for hardware and someone says about the

363
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,329
vendor I would say which vendola

364
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,399
someone had very

365
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,380
precise ideas even decided that he was the ceo of

366
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,480
bit fi and therefore that stuff his in short

367
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,140
so this is my wallet well but

368
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,300
if  can't look temple the components of the

369
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,279
iphone ex of the iphone 10 you

370
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,050
look at that acs ellero month the ex

371
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,579
limit the basement pro sixth the

372
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,620
chip batteries are all made this

373
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,420
is the apple iphone i

374
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,520
think no one argues that the  'iphone

375
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,410
is from apple

376
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,570
in reality the iphone from apple to components

377
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,810
by all vendors not only to

378
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,820
show you the apple suppliers and

379
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,570
2018 were 200

380
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,620
this means that to make a

381
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,980
device inside there are 200 sells or

382
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,480
software or hardware

383
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,449
then  i is true the mentors I tell you I ask

384
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:54,960
who is the wind the vendor of what if

385
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,980
you find a vulnerability is a

386
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,680
component to those who have ratified it

387
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,670
this to make it clear that in reality

388
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,380
this world is much more

389
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,210
complex than you might think  you

390
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,340
buy microsoft windows it is clear it is

391
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,380
clear that it must fix it you buy

392
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,680
adobe pdf it is clear to fix there then the

393
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,990
firewall is clear of pixar and buy a

394
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,300
phone you find vulnerabilities this is not

395
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,490


396
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,420
said to make you understand that in reality

397
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,600
nobody really  alone owns a

398
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,550
device because the device is the

399
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,800
result of an ecosystem in an effort

400
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,710
I say system in general

401
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,930
then the interesting thing how

402
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,460
we deal with it is how we choose them

403
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,020
these devices are actually so

404
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,170
complex or in general we buy them for

405
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,180
two

406
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,090
price factors  without what it costs it is not even

407
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,100
what the equal features are

408
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,520
these two features and the reasons

409
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,740
therefore basically

410
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,470
these are generic reasons.

411
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,600
but it is that security is usually

412
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,810
not a parameter that is not anti and if we want to

413
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,940
buy a device that is safer than

414
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,740
another, we suppose that we are part of

415
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,730
this wonderful

416
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,610
perspective, in short, not having the

417
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,770
tools to choose it, that is, there is no

418
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,200
way you do not have indicators, they say

419
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,080
this is not better than this the

420
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,820
market basically does not offer

421
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,770
discriminators to make you understand what is

422
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,180
better things get worse than

423
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,520
comparing obviously you can ask

424
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,410
an expert what he thinks maybe but the

425
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,420
fact is that today while the

426
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,460
price is  can ask is it true they say

427
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,440
while the features publish them in

428
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,910
security no one knows how to say anything

429
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,950
so even wanting to choose

430
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,180
more secure exposure in another it becomes difficult

431
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,410
so in essence we are in a

432
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,840
situation where the devices know a

433
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,400
lot about that software and we know and

434
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,110
software a in  generally vulnerable and

435
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,850
I say I also add the rab coeli to

436
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,470
any device at bonn and speed

437
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,540
but here  there is so much there is much

438
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,050
more than what is often thought

439
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,450
of very powerful hardware today we

440
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,030
are no longer talking about

441
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,260
20 makers of but the controllers we are

442
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,000
talking about chips go easily 1

443
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,059
2 gillet and there are at least  8 12 inside

444
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,520
there is therefore something that in any case is

445
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
comparable to a PC from years ago without

446
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,369
any problem and are the result of

447
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,470
an effort of game system that

448
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,819
is in any case large and risks to see precisely

449
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,459
several of different flaws and in general we

450
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,849
do not buy them without cheating security

451
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,390
I ask you and what can go wrong

452
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,160
basically everything actually

453
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,100
now let's go and find out together

454
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,030
actually we do not recommend yes

455
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,920
missionary ok so whatever I

456
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,870
will show you you are looking for to mentally bring it

457
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,100
to a situation

458
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,600
of enter unity taken in common

459
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,220
attacker tries to access

460
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,040
confidential data  or a situation in

461
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,340
which an attacker tries to

462
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,660
encrypt the control

463
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,950
of the entire structure, let's say these

464
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,720
are the two assets  more important these

465
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,300
in these two scenarios

466
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,380
to reason we will have an example

467
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,870
precisely a a text scenario

468
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,210
to show you right about some things

469
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,980
we will start with we cisco r b 34

470
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,660
340 that nat does and roll etcetera

471
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,960
etcetera and that its router a small

472
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,550
office

473
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,530
c  'it is a vin 10 in a data server and that

474
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,910
contains the information we do

475
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,530
n't have it here it is not important that

476
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,510
because I wanted to have thought only about the

477
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,290
device pretend that it is there and we have

478
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,350
an old access point also because it

479
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,270
is in the network  mount one 200 is

480
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,550
finally a mobile device connected to

481
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,020
that network that is basically this here

482
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,630
to see both here and

483
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,700
then now, however, do some things

484
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,770
obviously the cisco is connected to the

485
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,350
internet

486
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,780
if all goes well it should yes

487
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,179
we will have to be able to navigate I am

488
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,440
checking  if everything is in place

489
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,850
ok and then basically the

490
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,549
exposed on the wan and on they have access

491
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,470
to a service from puppets n is a

492
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,770
fairly normal thing for a for a route  r

493
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,750
that or in any case for a fire what

494
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,549
this service offers is TV connect

495
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,320
to a

496
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,700
remote office it is normal that

497
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,400
in some situations there may be an active vpn and

498
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,020
obviously there is the

499
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,809
attacker and I do it who was on the

500
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,030
internet for convenience is  in the

501
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,580
pleasant network but it does not change much the

502
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,710
fact is that obviously the attacker

503
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,230
cannot can not speak to any of the

504
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,850
other components because there is a

505
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,590
firewalling component so

506
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,659
in any case that man there

507
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:35,580
cannot contact directly in the other

508
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,679
objects in  then practice the only way

509
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,010
to get to that server and try

510
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,090
to find ways to get there ok

511
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,010
so socially all the attacks to

512
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,480
provide will all be vice

513
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
based I will not do anything against which windows

514
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,260
server that is when I get to be able to

515
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,640
do it and I will not  because we would not have the

516
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,159
time but the message will be clear so we will

517
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,900
probably use all of them

518
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,000
powerful from public and some

519
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,669
I implement it  and we will

520
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,230
work in many stages in multiples

521
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,750
basically so we will do the demo is

522
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,480
that the demo sends it to us good

523
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,419
then connoisseur let's go to we enter

524
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,770
the main door

525
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,289
our cisco in considering 40 a

526
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:19,440
small router of cisco was a target

527
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,850
at the pantheon 2021 let's say a cpu  albi

528
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,360
seven to third parties if 32 bits and bytes sexy and the

529
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,640
trains we say aida calls it that and

530
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,890
therefore useless we too are

531
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,669
basically this

532
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,010
device this vpn listening on the

533
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,250
door 48 44 3 the outside this the

534
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,289
gentleman I present it to you and right let's go

535
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,750
to look a little less better if you look at

536
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,120
this seville it was found

537
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,410
in the pon pon

538
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,800
by the flash back team for a free e dom

539
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,550
and I don't remember the surname sorry the

540
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,990
source kidnapped in the code of the

541
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,600
vpn server listening allows edf to

542
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,270
essentially get

543
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,650
root privileges directly as

544
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,010
code

545
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,810
the patch was released in

546
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,300
February 2, 2022 the then there was

547
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,400
destroy and the esprit chords was

548
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
released to  others present now in

549
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,670
metasploit and therefore what I

550
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,740
will show you now that we try it

551
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,080
together and see precisely what happens

552
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,540
we see it in action what

553
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,010
we are going to do is precisely to take

554
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,740
possession of the mister we scroll dumb and 40

555
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,010
and we will do it substantially  directly

556
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,020
from the

557
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,300
attacker who sees the outside let's see

558
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,169
a bit then first of all

559
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,159
my mouse

560
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,240
still

561
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,580
good now it should say too

562
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,810
it takes courage it's true it

563
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,570
's starting

564
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,580
so basically you are

565
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,830
actually seeing live the first thing

566
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,149
I do I look for the esprit

567
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,830
is obviously if the  'we immediately

568
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,300
at the beginning you see that there is an exploit

569
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,510
then we simply do 10

570
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,420
let's say we want to use colors

571
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,960
there is a feedback during the day thanks

572
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,140
let's see who it is

573
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,720
then to be sure

574
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,000
let me do something for a moment I want to

575
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,650
make an emblem then  just to see if

576
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,880
the active force

577
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,330
here it is

578
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,400
and in the maps if all is well if I

579
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,410
connected serious like how I

580
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,790
should connect it  i should tell you that

581
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,680
the perfect open door mediates an

582
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,810
open door so we have it we do

583
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,360
not know if

584
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,800
if I point if it will be bonera b and if we

585
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,560
spend it well at a percentage let's say

586
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,830
between 90 95 100 of success so

587
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,180
let's try to be patient if not

588
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,890
should it go then

589
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,230
first of all we think about the options then we

590
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,370
hear our remover soon to

591
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,770
attack there is this the victim who is

592
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,720
precisely at an address 2.1 ok just

593
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
to check

594
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,180
lowe's has also here

595
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,680
this the port in which I want the shell

596
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,660
to return the  port 10,000 arrives

597
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,320
and this is precisely the

598
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,750
here it should be here and this

599
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,600
is basically I am saying we

600
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,050
attack the device 2.1 and the

601
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,270
return shell will be a river shell and

602
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,180
it will connect to me who are the 2.70

603
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,430
on ports 10,000

604
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,800
let's see some last verification  before

605
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,610
everything is in

606
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,070
perfect order and a share pour l well

607
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,380
then

608
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,810
you expo and jewish as they say

609
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,690
go

610
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,200
give me the shell

611
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:23,389
here is the session an open I have not done  or

612
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:24,589
nothing in particular actually I

613
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,719
launched a tool anyone could do it

614
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,789
basically the

615
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:30,829
important thing however is that we are inside and

616
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,979
how we are cruz because I did

617
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,989
this thing here in reality this will serve

618
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:38,569
to reflect reality but it is a

619
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,279
very simple thing so basically

620
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,369
we have done in short in a moment

621
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:44,779
everything that in reality in some

622
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,279
situations can take weeks and

623
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,949
months this to tell you that to get to

624
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:50,929
this simple situation from here and

625
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,019
practice foiling promises spent

626
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,779
several weeks of research however and

627
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,279
this to make it clear that now

628
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,629
let's put the session in the background it can

629
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,569
come back anyway after let's

630
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,269
think for a moment about this one on

631
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,669
why it

632
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,579
is actually important

633
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,649
the observations I would like to make that now

634
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:15,049
you have seen attack I ask you but

635
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,239
this attack we must do detention

636
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:20,440
nice ok how do we see shawn

637
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,119
levy a bit us  we are the experts of

638
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,769
election we are full of

639
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,859
stable tulle the things I would like to ave  re ideas on

640
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,669
how you on how we can catch her

641
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:32,749
because basically I see her an

642
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:35,269
audition tough to catch this thing here

643
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,279
before the full service in

644
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,619
authorized and read here it is not that you can

645
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,659
put a file or to block it at this

646
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:44,419
point turn it off is the same

647
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,940
the service is encrypted it is also the first

648
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,549
connection in https so all

649
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,419
the signature based we have on the

650
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,399
attacks we do absolutely

651
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,129
nothing there are no dr agents on

652
00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:03,549
cisco rauter so you have suggestions

653
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,690
lobbia tender this this is a good is

654
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,079
a good suggestion

655
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:16,509
assuming  that the stars vpn

656
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,279
logging service of this type here I understand

657
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,599
that it does not have any, however the suggestion

658
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,549
was good so it was already a

659
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,899
definitely good idea others

660
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,658
a little higher the voice sorry

661
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,720
yes then I suggest that maybe

662
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,049
this type attack is done in

663
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:42,299
in an hourly period that is not perfect, therefore

664
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,830
allocations apply some

665
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,710
correct behavior analysis assuming that

666
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,570
line one is under the  his control

667
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,230
that is correct but I mine on

668
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,720
purpose here and make you think about the

669
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,789
direction agreed the comments is not

670
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,299
really trivial in this case right

671
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:02,009
I hope so

672
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,899
there is still to check this

673
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:07,489
thing sorry

674
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,279
there is another thing like  my name is not you this

675
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,929
stuff here we are on the

676
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,720
border router that we make to you

677
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,549
that is he who basically has secrets

678
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,879
to the various networks the guests from the vpn from

679
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:22,440
data servers and everything else a holter

680
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,090
take possession of that center is no longer there

681
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,250


682
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,360
and cannot  not even do the corse

683
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,789
passion me and the orange lire maybe

684
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,200
think about it because we don't have

685
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,759
the time maybe it answers everything but I think it

686
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,389
is an important question

687
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,279
what is the response here ben phillips is

688
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,389
available so basically

689
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:41,700
the only sensible thing to say pecci pecci

690
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,769
patch with  networks hurry up and put it

691
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:46,200
directly to hear true agreement on

692
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,070
this thing I guess ok well but I have

693
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,409
some problem or some question for

694
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:53,399
you

695
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,190
to actually

696
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,779
reject every device where  to know that

697
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,419
there is the network you know in your

698
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,639
company how many devices

699
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,850
you have before you have an inventory

700
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,529
you know what the artifacts are for the

701
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:10,139
models the firmware versions of the webcams

702
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:12,919
that you have installed security

703
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,049
if someone does these things raise your

704
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,519
hand  because for me it would be

705
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,879
really one one

706
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:23,700
all you all know them very well excellent

707
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,460
we have some hope then

708
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,629
obviously this means that

709
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:29,070
once you have recognized that you have

710
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,809
these devices it is that they are at that

711
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,190
level of summer version even

712
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,409
following if you close bulletin

713
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:37,639
assuming that the wind them  releases

714
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:40,360
because it is not said that it is so simple

715
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,250
then at this point you must also

716
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,080
follow up on getting informed becomes a

717
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,090
flow of information that parallels

718
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,740
everything that you security and that is

719
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,130
usually not understood

720
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,360
how do you know that he had to

721
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,340
apply a patch  as I said

722
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,870
normally the sign of a good

723
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,790
microsoft team arrives, something arrives and you know

724
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,929
that you have to act  but maybe there isn't here that is,

725
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,490
it doesn't exist we have never seen a

726
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,200
bulletin video for a powerline

727
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,179
controller sent by the bands please

728
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,640
patch you love

729
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,080
maybe we'll get there but it's still not there

730
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,080
so in essence it is true that it was worth it

731
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,240
I can have a  an entry point

732
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,820
in your infrastructure could

733
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,610
be difficult to make an action buy

734
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,710
a compromise

735
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,730
obviously but to start

736
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,470
working on it we have to start immediately

737
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,020
putting on processes it is not only

738
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,630
special because maybe we have to

739
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,760
respond in a different way this

740
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,080
is similar but to what we already have

741
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,540
in them for other assets in the company for

742
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,280
pc and server is a whole series of things

743
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,929
we also believe right or

744
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,850
something like that I am no longer aligned on

745
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,309
which at the time it was so for the problem

746
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:49,720
that these gentle devices are twenty

747
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,460
are they too are  endpoints

748
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,020
instead we usually call you hardware we

749
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,690
forget about them so it is also a single

750
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,580
hand raised and a good starting point

751
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,100
if  condo me then this point but

752
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,559
let's say okay store it's easy it's caught

753
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,740
a rare vulnerability it's certainly

754
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,080
very present how much there must be I

755
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,360
say fair rightly so now

756
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,460
let's go to think in another of

757
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,370
another object in another direction

758
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,190
obviously the device fans are there  there

759
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,559
are a lot of them and they can be unsafe and

760
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,970
you could always have them in your

761
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,720
network for the simple fact that maybe

762
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,950
we bought them for the functionality

763
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,960
and we have not even really dealt

764
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,660
with the security part so

765
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,610
their feeling of security is likely

766
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,390
to be  it is no longer considered

767
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,000
so unless I see a power process it

768
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,340


769
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,179
often happens that reality often happens to

770
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,000
forget about it let's give an example

771
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,220
a situation comes in which someone because

772
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,110
they lack the cover jesi port the access

773
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,270
point at home they are all who have

774
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,780
200 802.11 yes  we agree, however, not

775
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,840
all companies have this not all

776
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,549
have this type of speech while there

777
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:01,740
will always be  and someone who maybe for

778
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,980
some reason because he has coverage to

779
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,179
fully apply will use what

780
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,360
he has available

781
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,799
this gentleman was quite ancient is

782
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,169
quite ancient and was very common in

783
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,090
his time many times have been

784
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,940
published and

785
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,140
stands out there are many like this

786
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,520
device but there are only to yes

787
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,630
assigned here at the time it was not custom and

788
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,520
therefore there is not even a fix or rather

789
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,770
I do not know if there is a third

790
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,419
better still I can no longer find the

791
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,100
firmware this object here they are no longer

792
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,520
lens then finally this is the point

793
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,710
obviously a cpu mips of the 200 meters

794
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,380
nothing particular has very little

795
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,350
flash memory of dear struggled a lot

796
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,809
to

797
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,040
do xplore of really on this

798
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,600
object in reality the vulnerability is

799
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,770
trivial

800
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,340
there are default credentials that

801
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,960
allow it arrives  a page that

802
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,790
inside a buffer overflow this is the

803
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,320
essence basically nothing

804
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,970
really particular

805
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,630
the vulnerability of the http server but

806
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,440
what is the pu  nto here http is

807
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,120
inside my company that is I cannot

808
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
reach it directly

809
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,650
but some http server vulnerabilities I

810
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,120
allow you to do what is called

811
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,820
browser pivot tint that is I can

812
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,100
ask a browser of another le

813
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,950
vice please do this for me  in

814
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,179
practice

815
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,390
now we are going to see

816
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,460
this part together p because in reality

817
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,210
we would have remote code execution as root

818
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,990
on the internet on the

819
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,230
ethernet interface which is not reachable

820
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,669
but we can bounce on a connected device

821
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:39,780


822
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,940
so in this case we see this

823
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,690
explode

824
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,179
there will be a  dm twitter sent to my

825
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:48,429
phone here in reality it has already arrived

826
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:51,460
I just have to click it there will be a short

827
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,809
url a short as I will show it is

828
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,730
cyclical and must solve so but it will go

829
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,919
to solve so I do not know what

830
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,230
is in there

831
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,789
solve it comes back to me  to an address that

832
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:05,409
will be automatically opened by the new

833
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:07,240


834
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,789
browser my browser will go to the destination and

835
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,190
it will actually read the page to the

836
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,980
page  di from a javascript code that

837
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,320
runs in the browser and then

838
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,850
my phone will make a request to the

839
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,450
access point by completing it when it

840
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,629
explodes it will throw a payload that

841
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,299
will be shell universe above this is

842
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,879
what I will show you now

843
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:33,419
always our demigods  ok

844
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,789
so first thing i will show you the

845
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,070
unborn phone i have to start a

846
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,970
few things excuse me

847
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,550
ok

848
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,649
assuming that everything is fine

849
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,540
all if all goes well here you should

850
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,929
shell

851
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,520
let me open the phone now

852
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,619
last that is

853
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,790
but this phone book

854
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,359
of m my company and  we see that it happens

855
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,130
very well

856
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,270
you should see

857
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,300
ok we have it here

858
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,530
and we have a choice on that

859
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,150
page everything worked it

860
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,740
was a little complex as a demo but

861
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,660
basically you have seen that

862
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,830
the phone opened with the page

863
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,720
basically went to explore the

864
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,640
device  ok this device and we keep it

865
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,730
good here I need this

866
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,560
choice because after that in reality I will do

867
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,960
another another thing with this  This choice

868
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,030
so I keep it here well aside but

869
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,830
we have reflected on this on this

870
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,650
attack here the demo we have made a

871
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,900
series of observations

872
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,550
such as the face detection of this attack

873
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,770
because there is still a

874
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,880
personal question from detention of this

875
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,100
substantially  you receive a dm from on the

876
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,680
phone as you obviously receive it

877
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,840
via the voice stay theme that you tps

878
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,550
on the phones hand on twitter it is not

879
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,650
strange such a thing at least I think

880
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,100
and then there is the resolution of the scream here

881
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,590
maybe the phone goes on that  site

882
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,140
is so it could say something this yes

883
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,500
this can be strange but in my opinion

884
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,210
the strangest thing is that an

885
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,850
access point goes on the internet

886
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,490
what is the reason for a vice to go

887
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,230
on the internet unless it is to

888
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,720
update us this is a

889
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,360
polis problem in my opinion that is in my opinion

890
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,070
once you have identified the device and where

891
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,170
if day and how they update the thing

892
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,990
to do you are there you do not go out you have no

893
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,590
reason to succeed so here the detax yes

894
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,440
can do by applying this reason

895
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,789
but 1 apply this reasoning

896
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:51,049
when I have spent the time to

897
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:54,109
think about it for a moment then the

898
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:56,329
medication can be there you can

899
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:58,609
also do the detection but in general

900
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:00,170
everything else the movement for example of the

901
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,319
phone towards the access point

902
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,859
I think they are easily identifiable in short

903
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,480
, agreed or I lose

904
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,720
something

905
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,279
ok the person in charge and that there is a

906
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:19,520
problem however that there is no patch it

907
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,160
does not exist I have not made anyone because the

908
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,779
device becomes life

909
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:25,490
the device in the online it means  it will be

910
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,490
vulnerable forever this means

911
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,619
the only possible answer and to throw it

912
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,829
away there is no other

913
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:35,900
possibility but there is a problem that this end of

914
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,880
life is not a problem that goes away with the

915
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,309
router it remains there basically because it

916
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:43,369
poses  of the problems quite serious because

917
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,539
the problems in some

918
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:46,339
security communities cannot be

919
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:49,309
solved precisely how it works in the ten

920
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,839
best of you know when

921
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,849
your license expires  when you stop the contract

922
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:56,180
when windows goes into the end of life more

923
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,670
years mentioned years before or months before if

924
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,049
you are lucky years otherwise they are the

925
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:01,750
days

926
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,660
of the kind for files there is no such

927
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,150
thing because because when you buy a

928
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,670
device often no one me  he says how much to

929
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,279
laugh at the patches indeed none decisive

930
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:16,609
among the patches point the difference is that

931
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:18,380
when you buy the license from

932
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,049
microsoft you also bought the

933
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:21,849
support you

934
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,170
buy the level of security

935
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,089
maintained at the level in which you

936
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:27,740
bought it this thing of the devices does not

937
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,990
exist no c  'it is or not it is not that it

938
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,609
does not exist there should be there should

939
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,980
be but when we go to buy

940
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,140
these items we forget to ask it

941
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,200
or at least we do not ask it and this is

942
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,119
a big problem especially in

943
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,500
critical infrastructures in your

944
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,390
problems of which we have objects that

945
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,049
remain  service for 30 years

946
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:49,099
when we have set up these

947
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,020
infrastructures we have not asked these

948
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,240
questions usually then it is not  t some

949
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,400
cases we are aware of it in others I

950
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,599
am aware that they have not been

951
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,000
made as we are sure that in

952
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,290
ten years after we set up and

953
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,740
the plcs that control a dam that in

954
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,980
ten years the manufaktur will decide the

955
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,890
patches we must stay there  the contract

956
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,330
was the service contract it is necessary to

957
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,250
buy the pse enough it is useless

958
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,920
the problem is that we have to start

959
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,560
buying security not only a device

960
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,510
problem that also a system a

961
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,060
problem of ego level of ecosystem for

962
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,950
example an answer says that we have

963
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,720
found  a double of weiss that in reality

964
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,310
after six years

965
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,110
you say oh well he will be dead

966
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,210
no there were 14 thousand devices still on the

967
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,570
internet after six years

968
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,860
after six years

969
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,500
attention young man wore only two

970
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,570
we discovered chrome 14 thousand because

971
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,619
someone updated the malware to

972
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,600
use those devices  it makes no sense that

973
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,160
someone who makes money with malware a

974
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,900
day a malware for only two

975
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,420
devices in fact they were 14 thousand and only

976
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,970
therefore  ò from it he counted 2 then he counted a

977
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,580
thousand but always

978
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,290
the sportsmen this stuff here lasts

979
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,670
indefinitely

980
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,630
that is they do not go expire they have a

981
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,970
certain value at this moment those

982
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,040
subjects were actively defeated they

983
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,720
were part of a how to control and

984
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,090
together they were older for  how much

985
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,160
were 50 gigabits per second of

986
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,550
free bandwidth

987
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,010
explodes available

988
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,140
now my question in general someone

989
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,550
his problem is just asking or not

990
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,410
where does the rubbish we leave on the

991
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,119
internet end up and pass me the roman please

992
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,060
because it remains there and

993
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,520
we can not remove it

994
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,930
therefore substantially the  motorist the

995
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,030
devices should not be able to be sold

996
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,320
without there being a

997
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,109
safety contract or a patch or a way of saying

998
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:49,410
or it has expired point it no longer works even

999
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,180
if it continues to work so it is not

1000
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,530
pressing in short it must be done

1001
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,210
when since we buy it we have to

1002
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,070
ask the questions we have to say sorry but

1003
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,800
i buy this item for how much thousand

1004
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,420
and support for how much  give me the patches

1005
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,400
for example samsung started to

1006
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,100
say our phones have a support of

1007
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,900
these transit for five years there he

1008
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,910
knew it in advance you know that for five

1009
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,900
years you are covered then to me

1010
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,400
peel but at least you can plan

1011
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,809
no

1012
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:15,480
you should ask all  these things here

1013
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,640
when i have to basically i

1014
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,920
have communication to vulnerability in the

1015
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,869
community or not i get a following from the

1016
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:23,980
bulls

1017
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,390
how do i know i have to sin

1018
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,270
ap and the dark isis that you only know and it

1019
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,180
gets complicated so obviously

1020
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,059
all this has to become part of the

1021
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,410
your process of more care while

1022
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,270
acquisition because in any case you

1023
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,549
ask the vendor questions and make a market

1024
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,980
pressure if you say enough of

1025
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,299
these things sooner or later someone will

1026
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:46,270
answer you and if someone answers you the

1027
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,220
others are competitors who have been

1028
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,990
left behind so the first  who

1029
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,390
answers you generates a trend so if you

1030
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,760
start asking these things he knows

1031
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,559
only he will answer you for 1  2 years sooner or

1032
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,170
later someone will answer you however and when

1033
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,579
you answer the others are already behind

1034
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:02,829
so for me I think it is important to

1035
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:04,869
do these things because we are buying

1036
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,109
safety and not a device

1037
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:11,020
the last short little time

1038
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,640
but I would like to do a couple of

1039
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,069
quick touches then you protect from the

1040
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:16,809
devices because until now that you want

1041
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,289
to protect the devices

1042
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,279
this is a problem because in reality

1043
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:23,230
we would like to make the movement between the

1044
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,559
devices and when you catch them or rather

1045
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:28,380
the play they catch but for now

1046
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,819
I think that normally they are  you speak little and

1047
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:32,829
since little is said about it I wanted to

1048
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:35,770
see in practice so we always have

1049
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,599
our taxman this time but we are

1050
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,740
still in control of those access

1051
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,500
points you remember so now what

1052
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,539
I will do there are inter fa vulnerabilities

1053
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,460
interfaces lanna do not go into the details

1054
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,920
there  it is an http server problem what

1055
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,349
I am going to do now is I will go

1056
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:52,390
from the access point to the cisco I am already

1057
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,670
in the  network and we will go there

1058
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,319
substantially then use all

1059
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,750
access point with a pivot from outside

1060
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,960
bounce on the point and basically

1061
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,210
I will do nothing but build the

1062
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,170
tunnel I have to do it by hand because the

1063
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,589
device does not have an ing act but it

1064
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,329
does not even have netiquette  I had to

1065
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,099
compile it to him obviously at

1066
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,049
this point once he built

1067
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:17,760
these tunnels in a certain way semi

1068
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,150
able to interact with the

1069
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:24,269
internal cisco router interface as if

1070
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,130
I am still on the outside

1071
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,720
at that point I can basically

1072
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,269
send all of them  vulnerabilities

1073
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:32,010
can explode with a life as if he were

1074
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,819
inside

1075
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,490
and this is because his sponte was

1076
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,680
vulnerable before in reality all this

1077
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,779
entails once I can talk

1078
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:41,460
to the device and chaining three

1079
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,619
vulnerabilities two I need to then

1080
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,470
pass the ventilation and become

1081
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,450
user user execute as

1082
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,640
joseph says once i became user i

1083
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,220
jackson an

1084
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,839
ad session  min that is, I have to change a file

1085
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,579
substantially at that point I can

1086
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,440
talk to an innermost component

1087
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,359
that is also vulnerable to the third the

1088
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,640
vulnerability is that it makes me run the

1089
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,579
contained code so how does

1090
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,650
this thing work now first I have to do

1091
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,460
April 1st one an excuse me is second  just

1092
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,490
because I wanted to show it to you

1093
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,660
I have to remember the port

1094
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,599
ok

1095
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,160
we hope it works obviously

1096
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,680
ok this is mine if everything works

1097
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,989
we should have an interface as root

1098
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,150
in here now what I have to do is

1099
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,190
simply as the session

1100
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,440
still hangs on the other side  you remember

1101
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,160
not finished it

1102
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:14,299
therefore

1103
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:17,999
since I did not terminate it or a script

1104
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:21,569
that is this script of exploiting sites

1105
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,650
as soon as I close the shell as now

1106
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,690
you should where to do all the path

1107
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,119
that I just told you

1108
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,029
now it will work boh in short it is also

1109
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:34,160
quite

1110
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,650
particular as what  if everything goes

1111
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,829
well here they are broken so basically

1112
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:43,259
what you have seen now is that

1113
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:46,009
ef  Actually

1114
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,720
this is the cisco device

1115
00:45:54,799 --> 00:46:01,279
and this is its interfaces

1116
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,229
just to verify that they are

1117
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:05,910
actually him there is a net 10

1118
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,259
obviously this is here you should see precisely

1119
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:13,739
the 3.1 that lager faces internal and the 2.1

1120
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,170
here the ii that the external interface

1121
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,969
this coincides with  what i said

1122
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:20,089
so summer we are on the device now

1123
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:22,140
cuz i showed this

1124
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,119
thing i showed them this thing because

1125
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,619
this is what we did from there from the

1126
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,989
outside basically the

1127
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,150
device connected to me carrying out me so i

1128
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,529
did nothing of the album  and I went

1129
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:37,440
from the access point control or

1130
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,019
used this to explore the

1131
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:41,789
router and at that point in the network if with

1132
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:44,130
no different cells to me I stop here

1133
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,359
because I don't have the time but in reality

1134
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,219
having taken possession of that point was a

1135
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:48,869
widower and  attack the server but

1136
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:51,569
in short I think we say what

1137
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,039
we are talking about it should be clear

1138
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:54,730
how I stop here

1139
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,020
[Applause]

1140
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,970
thanks

1141
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,350
I still have two minutes to  re an

1142
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,320
important thing the other question to do in

1143
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,360
this situation concerns the door

1144
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,640
closes and not so much the support where to

1145
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,660
ask how this was done I

1146
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,580
rejected in the sense that it has passed the

1147
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,840
security certifications

1148
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,280
the code you use is tested and is

1149
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,650
subject to review  regular what is the

1150
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,270
development process so while the

1151
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,640
first part where to ask what is the

1152
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,310
support in the second part you have to

1153
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,200
ask here now how good

1154
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,480
this object is

1155
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,010
so again this part here in short

1156
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,260
there is another important thing that I would like to

1157
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,780
close the closes  fast

1158
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,740
actually saw these newlyweds are

1159
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,880
vulnerable for we have always done

1160
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,670
only traffic p ok but there are dragons

1161
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,000
interface and wifi inside

1162
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,740
i want to go fast and

1163
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,260
normally wifi functions are on a

1164
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,150
different socks universe system on chip

1165
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,400
than the application ok this  here

1166
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,130
the snapdragon then here above I will not show you

1167
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,160
demos on this but I would

1168
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,930
like you to think about it stand  because

1169
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,910
these objects I know that they run

1170
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,160
extremely complex firmware there is

1171
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,300
all the wifi staff and inside there is the

1172
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,950
so it is easy to think that this

1173
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,420
complex code may have

1174
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,280
vulnerabilities it has in fact been found,

1175
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,190
however, the pound 2017 go and see a

1176
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,990
little bit of  details there is a buffer

1177
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,300
overflow in the passing of the

1178
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,700
multimedia extension the vulnerability

1179
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,710
is precisely this in short there are various

1180
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,810
details this photograph in this

1181
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,080
single I know it is made by broadcom has

1182
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,900
resulted in this talk

1183
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,810
about vendors has made millions

1184
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,600
of mobiles vulnerable  phones and access points and

1185
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,290
let's talk about samsung htc lg nexus of

1186
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,180
google pixel from the time for example

1187
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,760
without counting all the routers the

1188
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,680
other exponents the other wifi objects

1189
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,110
that use this soc esprit was

1190
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,000
not trivial write it I did not write it

1191
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,950


1192
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,040
in short, however, they managed to write it,

1193
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,869
the interesting thing is that once it

1194
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:06,730
is in that soc it must go and migrate to

1195
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,349
the application  ation there becoming possession of the

1196
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:09,730
kernel well this too was done

1197
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,400
well this is not the point what I

1198
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,619
would like to tell you because the impact is important to us

1199
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,520


1200
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,960
because basically it means

1201
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,030
attacking a hundred meters away 50

1202
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,300
meters is not an object  a

1203
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,050
wifi device execute the code without ever making

1204
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,240
ip traffic

1205
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,510
there is no ip traffic there is radio traffic

1206
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,930
entered a wifi soc and attach the

1207
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,329
application part substantially then

1208
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:38,650
you have taken possession of those

1209
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,800
objects of the phone and or of the tris point

1210
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,150
without doing  no type of traffic p

1211
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,920
the wifi poor g then it is everywhere in

1212
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,750
general so I am and this will be

1213
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,329
another that will be vulnerable at this

1214
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:53,410
point but the problem is that the

1215
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,690
perimeter of 23 le manta rays becomes

1216
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,359
relevant because the concept of secure i

1217
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:00,040
board becomes ineffective  when we

1218
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,630
start thinking about things that

1219
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,730
are not the pious all those perimeters that

1220
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,290
we have built no longer exist they no longer

1221
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,800
make sense ok so this

1222
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,119
allows them to  i go attacking of various

1223
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:11,829
being alone in the network would like it if

1224
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:13,650
extremely sensitive and

1225
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,859
this does not depend substantially on

1226
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,420
the level of security there is no

1227
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,880
barrier here simply the best

1228
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,680
fi this is an example and it could be

1229
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,440
bluetooth it could be other in

1230
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,819
reality it can become still  worse

1231
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:29,650
because this being able to live in vorm

1232
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,839
hubble that is it means that it was not

1233
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,119
necessary to go attack the kernel

1234
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,210
you could stay in the software fi and

1235
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,920
attack in the next

1236
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,150
no one would have found us because it

1237
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,770
could never go to the

1238
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,780
application level of what we see

1239
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,060
remains closed in there is usually

1240
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,630
you want to attach a

1241
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:52,119
nearby device so the problem is that wifi

1242
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,000
covers and here in areas that are

1243
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,400
overlapping there is necessarily a signal that must be

1244
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,440
spread out there is a point

1245
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,329
where an access point hears another

1246
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:03,339
otherwise there is no coverage in  that

1247
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:05,050
area then all these

1248
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,060
dry situations for 1 1 with dynamo hubble forms

1249
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,950
of this of this og  cast here

1250
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,890
we have the possibility to migrate and

1251
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,779
attack the different devices without

1252
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:21,140
ever doing any type of ip traffic or being

1253
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,189
able to make the entire

1254
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:25,789
wifi infrastructure without ever being visible so

1255
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:28,160
basically it allows you to go and

1256
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,229
sell

1257
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:31,759
network rites that I therefore wanted to

1258
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:35,719
conclude at this point  I could hope

1259
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,699
that anyway device who is clear that they

1260
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,289
can have a significant role

1261
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:41,809
in the infrastructure structure

1262
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:44,089
you have to protect the missing devices you have to

1263
00:51:44,089 --> 00:51:46,880
protect yourself from devices in general it is

1264
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,739
because the attacks that can be done

1265
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,989
to date we may not have the tools

1266
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:53,419
to make detection easily Latin

1267
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:55,669
movement precisely also attack radio

1268
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:56,949
protocol

1269
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,239
safety experiment could be

1270
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:01,489
quietly hole must passed I

1271
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,769
think making a comment made you think a

1272
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:07,579
little is actually then you do not have

1273
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:08,959
control of the security of various

1274
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,519
reminders to the vendor so the only thing

1275
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,229
you can do is to support it in  a certain

1276
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,459
direction

1277
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:15,609
and quest  o there are recommendations

1278
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,049
establish processes try to understand

1279
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:20,299
how many there are and where they

1280
00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:21,890
are are you sure try to buy

1281
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,650
security and not just the device

1282
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,229
ask for security in general and

1283
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:29,809
above all have

1284
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,169
someone who knows them carry out safe testing

1285
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:33,730
thanks

1286
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,210
[Applause]

1287
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,820
thank you very much

1288
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,480
and  very nice
