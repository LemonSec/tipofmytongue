00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,459
these add up over time and then you get

this one pipe and this allows things to

community

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,979
and send control messages back and forth

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,860
but the complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this picture is</font>

it's a really big really big problem so

88

maybe a couple hands but not too many so

00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,849
it stands for controller area network

134
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,698
and the reason it exists is because it's

135
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:55,878
cheap everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the automotive world</font>

always make the feature work and then

138
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,819
make it as cheap as possible because

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:06,650
when you're making millions of something

<font color="#E5E5E5">costs really matters so can you can</font>

actually buy microcontrollers four

146
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:27,370
wire it up to a network of these devices

147
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:31,639
and suddenly you have fully full-fledged

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,050
broadcast networking its weight cheaper

149
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,750
and simpler than something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

look something like this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

simplified example unfortunately the

178
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,920
real ones tend to be proprietary and you

179
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,500
can't show them to people but you have a

180
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,899
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of control modules for engine body</font>

controls transmission anti-lock brakes

182
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,899
and these will be sharing messages all

183
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,750
the time and then this body control

184
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,459
module is acting as a gateway which you

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,410
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of as a router and</font>

186
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,140
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some messages and</font>

panel your door control modules and so

190
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,449
on and so forth again<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially up to</font>

a hundred different blue boxes and nine

194
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,680
it's really simple if you've ever dealt

195
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,990
with any protocols at like a bite level

196
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,479
you have a device<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this it's an engine</font>

of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all it consent that's the</font>

204
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,949
happens on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware side and there's</font>

some features<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one really uses</font>

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,930
ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of what you see looks</font>

00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,959
exactly like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so what will happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

208
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll have an engine control module and</font>

209
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,430
it will periodically let's say every 10

210
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,970
milliseconds be kicking out a frame like

211
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">this with some bytes in it and the</font>

212
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,310
instrument cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also sitting on</font>

213
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,329
the same can bus in this example so it

214
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,489
will listen for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ID which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 123 and</font>

215
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:30,250
it will when it receives that do

216
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">something with it and it needs to know</font>

217
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,520
what to do with it it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

218
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means and so that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we getting</font>

219
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,860
became databases these are files that

220
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:42,310
are rather proprietary you're not going

221
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,490
to find them to easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> though some</font>

222
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,579
people mostly the open garages folks so

223
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,620
open garages org are working on reverse

224
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,479
engineering these proprietary databases

225
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,700
and then publishing them which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

226
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,150
of cool but what these do is

227
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:01,240
they let you correlate just bites to be

228
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,430
real values with engineering units so

229
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,070
typically it will say here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the bites</font>

230
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,859
and you need to multiply by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number or</font>

231
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:11,380
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or add or subtract some number</font>

232
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,870
and whenever you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can go from</font>

233
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">just raw bytes on the can bus to</font>

234
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,750
actually revolutions per minute or

235
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,010
vehicle speed in kilometers per hour or

236
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,560
vehicle speed in miles per hour if

237
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're unfortunate depends on the</font>

238
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,079
country and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the instrument cluster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

239
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,500
have programmed into it at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

240
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,300
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually design this whole car that</font>

241
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay whenever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get one two three</font>

242
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,719
these first bites you take those put

243
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:43,209
them together you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get lx5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DC and that is</font>

244
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the number fifteen hundred with</font>

245
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,240
that information it can move the

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,370
tachometer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500 it's quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">flow of messages there's no real magic</font>

248
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:57,100
going on so the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can do</font>

249
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,710
to a can bus is inject messages and it's

250
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,320
a trusted network so everything is

251
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,630
broadcast you can anyone can send any

252
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,450
message if they're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus there's no</font>

253
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:10,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's no going on there's no</font>

254
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,060
way to resolve a port to an actual

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,180
device or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac none of that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font>

256
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,619
send a message everyone gets it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

257
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,750
you can do is stick your own controller

258
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,820
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bus because it's trusted you can</font>

259
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,700
just spray out whatever messages you

260
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,410
like and things will happen and one

261
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,080
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple example of doing this</font>

262
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be hey let's change our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rpm value</font>

263
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:37,680
to something bigger Oh x1<font color="#CCCCCC"> F 40 which</font>

264
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:39,790
happens to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8,000 whenever you do that</font>

266
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,000
a thousand now there is some you know

267
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,620
safety stuff that goes on it's not

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">always just as easy as switching the</font>

269
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,230
bites but it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it really is</font>

270
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,870
always obscurity and not security<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

271
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,000
maybe there's also a validity bit that

272
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,000
needs to be set to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one or there's a</font>

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,220
checksum somewhere but you can inject

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,630
these messages and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you get 8,000</font>

275
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">rpm on your techno matter which is</font>

276
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,720
cool this is obviously an example where

277
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,510
you're saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can move the</font>

278

dial whatever once you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex engine controls relying</font>

280
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,850
on can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do some much more serious</font>

281
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,040
things they protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a bit better</font>

282
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,800
they're checking for out of out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

283
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,959
bounds values but really once you're on

these periodic messages being shot out

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,820
introduced first in<font color="#CCCCCC"> california back in</font>

295
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,240
like 91 1996 it became mandatory in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">US it's in all vehicles everywhere</font>

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,310
basically including whatever you're

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,439
driving and it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some basic</font>

diagnostic functions over a variety of

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,720
protocols so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can but some other</font>

301
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,060
protocols as well and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

302
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,310
quite useful if you own a car and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,949
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why that check engine light</font>

blinking at you but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use</font>

308
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,180
this to figure out why it's on and

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually turn it off which is handy but</font>

310
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,260
it doesn't do much more than just what

311
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,950
are some fault codes basic fault codes

312

to the emissions side because all of

316
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,070
this came<font color="#CCCCCC"> along to regulate vehicle</font>

317

emissions and to test vehicles in

california it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really how it started</font>

319
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,200
there are also advanced diagnostic

320
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,730
features and these follow a standard

321
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:07,030
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iso which is iso 14 229 called</font>

unified diagnostic services this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

323
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,199
standard for making the requests and

324
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,810
getting responses but it does not

325
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,970
standardized what those requests mean or

326
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,768
what the response is

327
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,329
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's like an</font>

328
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,689
application layer thing but it's not the

329

full layout of what every<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet or what</font>

330
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:26,459
every payload will actually mean the

331
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:28,769
definitions of those like can databases

332
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,709
are proprietary and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

333
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,629
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diagnostics provide</font>

334
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,359
some really fun things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably</font>

335
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">never knew your car could do for example</font>

336
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can run arbitrary test routines on</font>

337
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,939
your car to do things like apply brakes

338
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:48,060
or you can modify parameters on your

339
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:50,610
vehicle in some cases things like VIN

340
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,579
numbers or odometers which is illegal

341
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">you shouldn't do it and you can also</font>

342
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:57,870
update firmware on some controllers you

343
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,599
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the code and</font>

344
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,639
run whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd like on there so</font>

345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's another another fun thing you can</font>

346
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,589
do fortunately they secure it

347
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,129
unfortunately they don't do a good job

348
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:14,129
typically so some security algorithms I

349
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:17,370
have seen on real vehicles you get a

350
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:21,329
seed value which is some number it looks

351
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,759
random ish but probably isn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

352
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:26,579
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply an algorithm and send back</font>

353
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,149
the valid response<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have seen that</font>

354
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:32,508
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> be subtract a number I've seen</font>

355
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:35,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that algorithm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be XOR with something</font>

356
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,600
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do a great job of it they're</font>

357
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting better though but there's a lot</font>

358
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,170
of vehicles out there where if you spend

359
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right tools you can</font>

360
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,269
actually totally break the security in

361
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:49,079
this but you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the campus</font>

362
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:52,079
and that's one place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've seen</font>

363
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,920
some more advanced attacks come into

364
00:16:52,079 --> 00:17:01,109
play so back in 2010 there were the auto

365
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,540
sec groups publications auto<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec org is</font>

366
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,039
a great website for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> they basically</font>

367
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,829
showed that you could do things like

368
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,439
call a vehicle and play a special song

369
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:14,220
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> data in it that would allow</font>

370
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:17,010
you to remotely send can messages that

371
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,829
attack actually did work more recently

372
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,879
there was the attack on fiat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well</font>

373
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:26,649
Chrysler's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeep that showed remotely you</font>

374
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,980
could connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open port that</font>

375
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:32,110
to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux d bus service that happen</font>

376
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,540
to use the nonnamous authentication and

377
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,459
from there they pivoted into being able

378
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,440
to send can messages and from there they

379
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,510
could do all the stuff injection

380
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">diagnostics whatever and that's where</font>

381
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,060
it's starting to get very interesting as

382
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,030
things are getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and more</font>

383
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,659
connected so you have some traditional

384
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:52,060
IT challenges of securing you know a

385
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,400
device not unlike your cell phone and if

386
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,070
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets compromised now you're</font>

387
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,840
potentially able to do some attacks that

388
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,840
would traditionally require you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

389
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,970
plugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the vehicle so we'll talk a</font>

390
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit about the tools that are out</font>

expensive vector is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> German company</font>

394
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:18,310
that makes some very nice canned tools

395
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:21,310
that cost just way too much money like

396
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,710
if your GM if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford whoever you can</font>

397
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:27,010
buy those and you can use them if you're

398
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,390
anybody else forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it like we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">plus trainings and subscriptions and all</font>

401
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,840
that so some companies have made some

some reverse engineering of this they

another decently popular one that's in

the hundreds of dollars range then

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a project called can't act which is</font>

432
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,400
really simply USB one on one side can

433
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,100
bus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other and it lets you talk</font>

434
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,770
there's also these elm327 knockoff tools

435
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,560
which do obd they will only do the

436
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Diagnostics obd stuff they won't do the</font>

437
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,169
periodic messages so you can hack them

438
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,600
do it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit but it doesn't work</font>

439
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,520
terribly well these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools are super</font>

440
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,490
cheap and if you own a car you might

441
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,410
consider buying one the reason is it

442
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,480
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably work on your car it will</font>

443
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">let you find out when that check engine</font>

444
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,800
light comes on why it's on you can try

445
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,140
to turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and see if it comes back</font>

446
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,120
on which is nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can save you a</font>

447
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,980
trip to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealership which is pretty</font>

448
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,679
handy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the average person driving</font>

449
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,020
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> there also about 10 euro on</font>

450
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,740
amazon but some of them are really of

451
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,360
questionable quality so read the reviews

452
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,870
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're available in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth and</font>

453
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,840
wired options the blue team well wired

454
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,030
is wired the Bluetooth option I actually

455
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,010
had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> evaluate one of these recently</font>

456
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,230
for somebody and they gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it came</font>

457
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:55,680
with a manual which said the Bluetooth

458
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:58,110
pin is 0000 you can't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so if</font>

459
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,630
you do use a bluetooth one you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

460
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,699
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it plugged in that being</font>

461
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:07,290
said if you're driving<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see a</font>

462
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,800
Bluetooth device called obd you be nice

463
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,800
that's

464
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,928
you can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things to someone's</font>

465
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:19,389
car at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point so can't act is sort</font>

466
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:21,309
of the thing I did the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> was there</font>

467
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:23,949
was no open source hardware firmware

468
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:26,379
tool and I like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source thing so</font>

469
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,379
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build something and it's</font>

470
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:31,869
just one canvas interface one USB

471
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:33,998
interface there's some jumpers on it to

472
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:36,189
select which pins are the pinouts to the

473
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:39,039
cable so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use different cables</font>

474
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,110
there's two standards because people

475
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,210
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not use the same standards for</font>

476
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the type of stuff and what's kind of</font>

477
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,739
cool is I did an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source hardware</font>

478
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,570
project I released all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the designs are</font>

479
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:52,809
all on github there'll be a link at the

480
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,668
end of this and some other people also

481
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:58,080
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ken tools that were a little</font>

482
00:21:54,669 --> 00:22:01,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">different so they forked it and one guy</font>

483
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,480
actually made the cannibal which is

484
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">another pun home and he wanted something</font>

485
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he could like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardwire his the</font>

486
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,259
connections into and it was small so he

487
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,289
built that and there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other ones</font>

488
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,609
for like isolated can and they don't

489
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">really show up as much but he actually</font>

490
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:22,418
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> sells the cannibal devices and on</font>

491
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:27,119
anything after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2008 sold in the US this</font>

492
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:29,859
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but the you i'm not sure but</font>

493
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,418
you need software and so on the software

494
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,480
side you have two options to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play with</font>

495
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,070
can for can't act for the other tools

496
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,359
they typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have proprietary software</font>

497
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:43,470
it's quite expensive some of it's not

498
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,389
expensive but also really not good and

499
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,669
on linux there's like some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

500
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:50,979
things there's a thing called socket can

501
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:54,059
and it makes a can device including

502
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:58,389
can't act look like an ethernet card

503
00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:01,418
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a total hack but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it works quite</font>

504
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:04,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually go if config can</font>

505
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:07,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero up enter and it brings up your can</font>

506
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:11,019
device and then you can connect to it

507
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,609
with things like Wireshark you probably

508
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:16,119
have used Wireshark have you dealt with

509
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:18,158
ethernet logging packets little did you

510
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,340
know that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a can mode</font>

511
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,549
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just hidden from the</font>

512
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,408
you unless you have a can<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices and it</font>

513
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:27,179
will do your typical you know log all

514
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:30,390
your frames you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort them filter</font>

515
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,950
them you can apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some protocols</font>

516
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,960
that are not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in automotive</font>

517
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,510
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply filters that are specific</font>

518
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,360
to the protocol and it will do all that

519
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:42,240
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can save a pcap file just like</font>

520
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,279
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet set of usenet packets but</font>

521
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,770
I've been working on this can't act app

522
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,230
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is shown kind of small here</font>

523
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,340
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools in</font>

524
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:55,380
one graphical application that is mac

525
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,730
windows linux compatible works with

526
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,620
can't act or the forks and it allows you

527
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,140
to do just you know show me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

528
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,449
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on the bus it also</font>

529
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,140
allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do a view where you're</font>

530
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:13,710
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every ID part of the</font>

531
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:18,090
message so every call are in the table

532
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">every row is just one ID and as the data</font>

533
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,049
changes so as the message is sent again

534
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,120
and again and again the data changes

535
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:26,370
that will change it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will highlight that</font>

536
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,229
it's changing in red and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

537
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:32,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually how you reverse engineer can</font>

538
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:35,789
buses for the most part you plug in a

539
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,580
tool like this you get in the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

540
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,529
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch York and traffic you'll see</font>

541
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,559
some things changing like counters going

542
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:45,059
up maybe some that other little values

543
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,700
changing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything sort of</font>

544
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,158
stabilizes then you do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

545
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,140
watch what changed and then you keep

546
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,049
doing it until you can reliably make

547
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,909
those bits change and after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

548
00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:01,940
just sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of write down okay well this</font>

549
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:04,890
is ken message with ID you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 012 and</font>

550
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,110
bites three and four whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I push the</font>

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,080
accelerator pedal go from zero zero zero

552
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,510
zero two ffff that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

553
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,370
accelerator pedal position it's really

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,190
elephant or elementary reverse

555
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:19,320
engineering it works quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the</font>

556
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,779
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can't act is able to do</font>

557
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,210
in limited amounts right now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

558
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,090
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on is the advanced</font>

559
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:30,059
diagnostics today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to do the non</font>

560
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,220
obd diagnostic stuff you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy</font>

561
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,350
expensive tools

562
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,990
and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun to be had with</font>

563
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,949
breaking you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security algorithms</font>

564
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,390
and that and also just attacking the

565
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it's an attack surface for those</font>

566
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,890
protocols so you can start to poke at

567
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,080
that so that's the other piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

568
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,260
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on and some links</font>

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,100
challenges today in the automotive

571
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,890
industry with all this stuff cars

572
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,480
they're getting more complex they're

573
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,620
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> more features things like a</font>

574
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,120
navigation was one that came<font color="#E5E5E5"> into every</font>

575
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,100
car but now you all can also receive

576
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,459
traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can install apps and all</font>

577
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,010
this stuff more automation your car can

578
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,600
maybe stay in its own lane which means

579
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can actually turn the steering</font>

580
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,219
wheel it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have cruise control</font>

581
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,459
which has been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for quite a while</font>

582
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,159
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has some way of</font>

583
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,669
moving the throttle some cars can break

584
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,740
on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own now so this leads to a</font>

585
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,080
greater damage potential of these sorts

586
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,179
of attacks and also more connectivity

587
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,850
again when you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting things on</font>

588
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:42,690
the internet they tend to show their

589
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:45,510
security problems a little clearer now

590
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,669
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an interesting trend</font>

591
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:50,850
whenever you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more dangerous</font>

592
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:53,520
things to compromise as well as a higher

593
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:56,399
likelihood or a higher attack surface to

594
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,289
poke at it's a trend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

595
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting as we see self-driving cars</font>

596
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,210
that you can hail from your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

597
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,950
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the other question is</font>

598
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,780
supply chain you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who make</font>

599
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,400
cars who have meet people who make car

600
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,408
parts you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who write software</font>

601
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who write software for</font>

602
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:14,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people who write the software and</font>

603
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,200
there's this whole stack there's

604
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,840
millions and millions of lines of code

605
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,380
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big problems that i'm</font>

606
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,199
talking with<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEMs about today is how do</font>

607
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">we figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's responsible and how</font>

608
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,360
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> test things the OEMs they would</font>

609
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,150
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write a specification saying I'm</font>

610
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,059
Ford I would like continental to make me

611
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,340
an engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> controller it shall you know</font>

612
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,860
control these cylinders do this it shall

613
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,830
allow it to rev up to this rpm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

614
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,320
and so forth but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't write in a</font>

615
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,860
specification it shall be secure and

616
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,010
expect that to happen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font>

617
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,469
and you need to actually put some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sup in</font>

618
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,360
place to allow for testing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

619
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole debate right now of who</font>

620
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,428
actually will do the be responsible for

621
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,260
testing and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get done and the</font>

622
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:06,720
last one is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked on with</font>

623
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,580
Tesla and some companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to</font>

624
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,330
do more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we</font>

625
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:15,570
patch cars so imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you installed</font>

626
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:18,720
windows when you bought your car and you

627
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,870
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> never update it it would probably</font>

628
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,880
have some issues today right and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

629
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,330
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases with cars the truth</font>

630
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,970
the only way that they can update it is

631
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,460
do it Jeep did and send everybody a USB

632
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:35,630
stick which has its own security

633
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,370
problems as you might imagine or

634
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,010
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> recall the cars and replace</font>

635
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,620
parts or update parts or call everyone

636
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,570
into dealerships it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feasible</font>

637
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,030
thing to do it but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to</font>

638
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,309
become real so a lot of cars now the

639
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:52,500
infotainment unit the head unit that can

640
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,780
update but the engine controller maybe

641
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the brakes maybe not so those are</font>

642
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,370
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current challenges I don't</font>

643
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,260
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am on time but thank you very</font>

644
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,178
much for being<font color="#E5E5E5"> here listening to this</font>

645
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,179
and thanks to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacking people</font>

646
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:22,750
thank you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can cut me off</font>

647
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,990
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at a time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> head of time</font>

648
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,990
now

649
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so i saw one first hand here do you</font>

650
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:49,260
guys want the microphones okay

651
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:51,750
he's fast I hope higher thanks for a

652
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,970
presentation it was really interesting I

653
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,890
was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> since I've been seeing</font>

654
00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:01,290
lately people people integrating

655
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:04,740
smartphones in within the infotainment

656
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:09,270
system of new vehicles do you think that

657
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:11,370
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to create</font>

658
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,180
further problems because you will also

659
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:17,790
have the smartphone security problems

660
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:20,280
imported into the vehicle yes so the

661
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">question was what problems are we going</font>

662
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,230
to see now that smartphones are getting

663
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,810
kind of connected into infotainment a

664
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,270
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so there's different ways of</font>

665
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,520
doing this some people have the

666
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,450
smartphone hit a web service that the

667
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,610
color also<font color="#CCCCCC"> can connect to that's one way</font>

668
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,250
of doing it we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really bad</font>

669
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,250
implementations namely Nissan's leaf if

670
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,470
you had somebody's VIN number you could

671
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,060
do whatever you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that the app</font>

672
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,560
could do all you needed was the VIN

673
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,639
number and that's printed on the front

674
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:56,190
of the car so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very secure as</font>

675
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,150
we see other implementations like what

676
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">rovol is talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have a</font>

677
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,500
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth right from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone</font>

678
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,300
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car now you end up with all the</font>

679
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,540
security problems that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

680
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,430
smartphone you know I'll especially on

681
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,460
Android like ninety percent of phones

682
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,250
out there can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooted with known</font>

683
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,870
vulnerabilities so if someone can get

684
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> secret's out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your phone that</font>

685
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:25,350
control your<font color="#E5E5E5"> car it really has become</font>

686
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,180
your your trust anchor and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

687
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust your smartphone for something as</font>

688
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,960
valuable as a car and something as

689
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,510
safety critical as a car is kind of yet

690
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be determined but I think it's going</font>

691
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to definitely go forward because they</font>

692
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,560
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be that oh you must</font>

693
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,910
have internet connectivity and your

694
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,129
vehicle must have internet connectivity

695
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,930
in order for this to work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

696
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,960
much nicer for you to just walk up to

697
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">your car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have that unlock and start</font>

698
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,760
the security of smartphones isn't really

699
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,680
right now though so it'll definitely be

700
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:01,360
a challenge going forward I hope they

701
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:01,360
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to opt out just back here</font>

702
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:11,960
thank you so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is um are the</font>

703
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,150
the frames going through the bus locked

704
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,610
somehow by any<font color="#CCCCCC"> band or by any cars are</font>

705
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:21,080
these so some words to allow forensic in

706
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:23,810
case something happens so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frames</font>

707
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,629
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bus logged I think we stored</font>

708
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:29,419
somewhere like in though um not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

709
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,790
in a production<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle in prototypes</font>

710
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,890
they stick particular like loggers in

711
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,379
there but to log every message is

712
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:39,770
actually kind of expensive you're

713
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,310
looking at like nine buses that up to

714
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:45,170
half a megabit a second and you drive

715
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,929
your car for hours a day it starts at up

716
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,790
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some talk about things like</font>

717
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:53,590
intrusion detection systems where you

718
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:56,210
can do some further analytics to say hey

719
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,070
this these were out of range values or

720
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,980
someone was probably trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mess with</font>

721
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:03,169
these bites but today you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't find</font>

722
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,030
anything that's really truly logging the

723
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,310
closest thing is there are fault codes

724
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get logged so you can end up</font>

725
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:12,440
in situations where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send some crazy</font>

726
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,260
value and it thinks that your engine has

727
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,860
blown up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a light comes on but you can</font>

728
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear those</font>

729
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:28,549
I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> how prevalent is like</font>

730
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,919
cars which are wireless connected like

731
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:33,260
the prideful surface year is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

732
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,510
like you think is certainly like a

733
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,610
problem right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now when it comes to</font>

734
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,370
wireless connected car or how many

735
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,899
wireless kinetic car do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see how many</font>

736
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,418
wireless connected cars are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road</font>

737
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,340
or yeah yeah when it can basically

738
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:50,450
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the campus via wireless hot</font>

739
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:52,370
blue tool for any<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour ok prodigal so</font>

740
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully none of them let you like</font>

741
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:58,539
connect right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the canvas via</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless</font>

742
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:02,629
but most cars today have<font color="#E5E5E5"> bluetooth or</font>

743
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:04,610
sell or Wi-Fi sometimes I'll often all

744
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,679
of them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems to be going that</font>

745
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,210
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> but most newer cars or they're</font>

746
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,700
sticking Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> and because it's cheap</font>

747
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,560
and that's an attack surface thing so

748
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that just allows you to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

749
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,099
traditional sort of embedded

750
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,109
vulnerabilities that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> find on</font>

751
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,149
any other system then once you can get

752
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:21,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like remote code execution you</font>

753
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:24,469
can get on the canvas in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

754
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,780
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing worth noting is</font>

755
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:29,959
that there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of products like</font>

756
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:32,109
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> obd dongles that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i showed that are</font>

757
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,480
meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be plugged into an obd port and</font>

758
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:38,210
if you're using one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these you're</font>

759
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,129
basically creating another link that has

760
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,310
not been audited by the people who make

761
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:45,830
the car and maybe really vulnerable

762
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:48,139
someone did<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently some research where</font>

763
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,319
they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on shodhan and they found a</font>

764
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:53,899
bunch of telematics devices for truck

765
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,080
the trucking industry that they could

766
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:58,580
remotely connect to with default credit

767
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,000
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even think there was a</font>

768
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,859
password you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tell net into it and</font>

769
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,859
it actually had functions that let you

770
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:08,509
send can messages so anytime things like

771
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:11,650
that get plugged in and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

772
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:14,420
more and more for insurance telematics

773
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,750
things like that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are</font>

774
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:21,050
becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular those present a new</font>

775
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:24,770
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack vectors so it's both the</font>

776
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,600
wireless features that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

777
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,700
infotainment as well as some of these

778
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,500
add-on devices and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

779
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,839
the day there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are attacks that people</font>

780
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,480
are doing where you cut a hole in a

781
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,400
window<font color="#CCCCCC"> or smash a taillight and then you</font>

782
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,860
can connect to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> canvas physically and</font>

783
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,500
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually were some vehicle theft</font>

784
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:46,460
rings that we're using that to reprogram

785
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,380
keys and then to drive the car away so

786
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,720
there's a whole range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack surfaces</font>

787
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,340
I guess I on them but i think it's

788
00:35:50,720 --> 00:36:01,609
growing whenever you see more wireless

789
00:35:52,340 --> 00:36:06,370
start to come in oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> dae q haces unity</font>

790
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,370
question answer thank you so much

791
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,350
you

792
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,950
you
