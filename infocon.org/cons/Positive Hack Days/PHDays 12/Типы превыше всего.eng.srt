[Music]

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,879
thank you

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,500
that is

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,300
Pablo please this is the time we will

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,420
welcome you on the stage thanks

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,960
yeah it's working yeah yeah so like that

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,020
started here so my my percentage car

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,539
types Beyond any but I mean kind of

9
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,920
approach here type type driven like

10
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,579
um

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,879
I'm really like uh

12
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,039
uh functional programming enthusiastic

13
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm on one of the dry python for

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,900
developers uh so if you don't know Drive

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
python pay us a visit there

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
so what's the type right when you when

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,780
you just start uh talking about typing

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,700
or when learning some a new language

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,759
like type just a type like just use it

20
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,820
you know uh but that's not wrong tips

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
important

22
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,900
let's talk about now tight as a promise

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,900
yeah

24
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,860
foreign

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,720
okay yeah so if I try yes a problem

26
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:20,659
first about functions and functions

27
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,860
foreign

28
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,778
[Music]

29
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,680
yeah the first approach will be like

30
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Alias

31
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,540
you can see here like non-zeroes

32
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,360
variable so here I just like this yeah

33
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,500
foreign

34
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,440
foreign

35
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,680
if statement we are going to have our

36
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,819
company statement

37
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,440
right now

38
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
um

39
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,400
you have just like non-zeroings and

40
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,299
everything will work

41
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,520
finest time

42
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,979
again because I can declare my

43
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,460
nonsurance

44
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,139
uh

45
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,779
I'm gonna say about I specific yeah

46
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,159
sometimes a phantom types library for

47
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,959
python uh yeah

48
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,899
uh exists on runtime Phantom time

49
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,440
basically I'm creating uh foreign

50
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,720
but for the type

51
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,519
checkered

52
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,640
additional information

53
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,620
so yeah that's the library I'm going to

54
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,480
use

55
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,220
disposite Phantom types and the way it's

56
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,760
work is

57
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,899
non-zero in functions Remains the Same

58
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,399
zero the type annotation returns

59
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,959
creating a new class and this is

60
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
respected

61
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,860
functions right remain the same no uh

62
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,860
is

63
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,519
a part of my predicates to see uh if

64
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,720
like every robot is

65
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,500
getting a more specific type you can uh

66
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,779
uh

67
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,540
give some addition and Y plus one

68
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,540
information

69
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,130

[Music]

72
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,680
okay so basically uh Titan versus new

73
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,380
type twist type in Sky verse Phantom

74
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,180
types like typing new types

75
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,709
[Music]

76
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,700
of project your instructor

77
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,000
so in case my string is nearby yes that

78
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
is easy and if my string is leverage

79
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,459
it's gonna print

80
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,199
imprint system how can ensure that our

81
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,180
function will always always works

82
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,180
foreign

84
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,199
type check uh

[Music]

86
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,220
and so let's talk about now

87
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,140
uh the example here is about ICC

88
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,320
Premiere uh and basically okay the uh

89
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,440
Haskell example speaker paper it's my

90
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,460
type name uh

91
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,580
speaker paper and speaker paper because

92
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,940
the the later is the my Constructor and

93
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,260
I have my converter parameters

94
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,720
my types I can use this syntax over here

95
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,259
[Music]

96
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,039
in Python and here I'm sorry

97
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,900
go check it out

98
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,020
uh okay but what about the illegal

99
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,100
states are talking about

100
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,100
yeah

101
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,320
let's say that an approved

102
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,880
I don't have a presentation date so it

103
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,720
shouldn't that because

104
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,919
I should have a presentation days no

105
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,640
yesterday speakers

106
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,760
but Saturday foreign

107
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,918
speaker paper

108
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,740
when it's approved

109
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,760
yo okay so yeah I just uh so I just

110
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,820
added the other approved paper case and

111
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,439
now everything are working

112
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,740
is done but

113
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,480
no you don't have like a way to have a

114
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,280
legal State because they have a lot of

115
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,940
us support

116
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,340
so yeah what do you have

117
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,159
a fire so don't remember

118
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
three conversions

119
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
um

120
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,880
true

121
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
um

122
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,500
and I can just have like uh if paper is

123
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,000
approved or it is

124
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,799
um

125
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:57,260
what about the things

126
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,440
API account

127
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,020
uh

128
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,000
yeah so what about the rest of the plane

129
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,980
world you have that doesn't know

130
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:20,480
so thinking about this extrater here uh

131
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,840
just using a dictionary so yeah now I

132
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,299
have my name in the same class I have

133
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,679
before that can be can happen

134
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,460
just just uh

135
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,700
the information the data

136
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
glasses

137
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,799
it's like an interface interface it's

138
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,720
like a protocol you're already knowing

139
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,500
python but it's not implemented by a

140
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,080
type but but it's implemented for a type

141
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,100
this class

142
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,100
uh just a basic use case here so yeah

143
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,158
I'm importing type classes yeah

144
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,940
um

145
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,670

146
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,449
[Music]

147
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,600
paper and for it's approved the

148
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,880
conjective if it is the instance of a

149
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,520
paper and to get my presentation date I

150
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,460
can just use the

151
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,460
gaps yeah

152
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,890
[Music]

153
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,179
things are using python uh the first I

154
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,340
think uh like it's most basically

155
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,740
example you have which literal string

156
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,980
no problem here

157
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,980
literally

158
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,740
[Music]

159
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,100

[Music]

161
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,419
and also you can track sensible data

162
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,260
using times

163
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,760
so basically

164
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,760
daily

165
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,539
so yeah

166
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,539
um

167
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,179
so everything here like it's all about

168
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,899
businesses

171
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,179

foreign

173
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,460
you're the first

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,859
thank you Pablo

175
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:17,820
this is the big difference between

00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,480
problems

we have um some questions partially um

181
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:56,460
I think is about current typing uh state

182
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,900
is Major enough to be

183
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,400
statically it's really cheaper which

184
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,760
like

185
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
resilience

186
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,880
okay the most like opinion I can have

187
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,520
here like you you don't you won't have

188
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,460
like typing things like Java because

189
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,060
like

190
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,180

221
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,119
even like my pie is from python software

222
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,440
foundation so I think it's like yeah

223
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,420
but I really recommend like my pie

224
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,680

225
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
