2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,639
so my dear friends let's redislocate

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
from the

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,639
replica we came to seoul area and right

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,119
now we're going to figure out who are

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,119
those people

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
which monitor informational security of

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
our standoff anton can you tell me

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,599
please

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,599
who are the main people

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
who work on this sock

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
first of all these are analytics

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,559
who

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,559
have the access to the infrastructure

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,120
and they have the list of uh unavailable

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
events which not should not happen in

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,280
the infrastructure and analytics they

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
should put these impossible events

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,399
developed they should make a list of

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,320
them then should develop some analytical

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,520
content

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
base which basically would be

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
transferred to monitoring

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,199
in other words our main objective was to

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
study the facility being protected by us

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,320
then we should forecast the options of

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,760
development and by this well this was

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,280
done by our analytics as for the period

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
of

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,520
this game

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,799
we've

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,080
selected

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
teams of monitoring

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,240
and for every area for every sector

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,520
we have selected a certain team which

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,520
analyzes

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,040
which analyzes and monitors of these

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
files

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
these positive results and we also have

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
analytics which work in three areas of

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
work

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
so analytics will verify them

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
three different groups i will tell you

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
what is the main difference

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
first analytics

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,360
they build chains these are people who

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
are standing here

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
they built risk chains

49
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,480
out there we have other guys before

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
behind

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,400
and all the visitors and our clients

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
are being told about this in real time

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
how the red team have realized that and

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
that threat the second group of people

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
works with blue reports reports of

56
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
defenders and these blue reports have to

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
be submitted from the point of view of

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,599
incident and risks that were implemented

59
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
so they know how these supposed to

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
happen and they check and they help to

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
correct something and say hey guys you

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,160
have not reflected this or this

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
but this involves full knowledge and how

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
it was happening how it is having

65
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,040
the group number three works with reds

66
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
we didn't uh cross it we didn't cross it

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
because the guys have been receiving

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,640
their experience so the red team also is

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,280
checking these they enter they verify

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,239
and they are asking us are you lying

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
or something has not been reflected and

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
blue team works uh separately they see

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
each other's reports plus there is a

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,599
some group of continuous monitoring

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,680
which is involved in these

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
detailed developments and transfer of

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
them to analytics okay anton modell

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
situation

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
you said that you work in 24x7 real-time

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
mode

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
and you speak about attack

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,000
vectors

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
so i came to you in a real time oh can

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
you select the attack chain and tell me

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,079
what happened here

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
can we do that okay right now in real

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
time we are going to be told about what

88
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
is the attack chain what it consists of

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
and most importantly how it looks like

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
on a monitor of real cyber security

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,439
specialist but for this we need anton

92
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
and monitor

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
okay anton have reached

94
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,759
anton is going to ask for help from his

95
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
colleagues he's going to put special

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,080
ammunition because without this

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
ammunition it's impossible to speak

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
about the attack chains

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
okay okay

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
okay i'm going to tell you about this

101
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
attack chain from the first team that

102
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,080
was realized and replacing the ticket

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,320
price for the railroad trains

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
so what do we see

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
we had a sight landing and

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
this is where

107
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
you could buy cigarettes especially as

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
you know

109
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,919
well you can see that these are

110
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,240
compromised the tickets uh there's a

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
train called sarca and there's a price

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
of this ticket which already well the

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,199
stark have changed them et cetera et

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
cetera so the main objective

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
the main objective uh for the red team

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
was to

117
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
the red landing

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
so

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
one could change the price of the ticket

120
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,000
you can save money so you could easily

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
put any

122
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
number uh under this cost position

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,960
price position

124
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
okay let's try to model this situation

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
how this uh landing has happened

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,400
and

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
that it can be broken and 12 teams

128
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
already broke it

129
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,440
well read as many times as you want

130
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,199
it's just an entertaining part for

131
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,160
example let's model a situation that

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,639
there's a logistical company which has

133
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
railroad trains

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
and uh

135
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,280
three it guys who are deeply involved in

136
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,160
operational objects et cetera

137
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,000
so the business comes to the a.t guy and

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
says that well i cannot

139
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
anymore uh work with

140
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,199
these people okay let's do something

141
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
digital and let's sell these tickets to

142
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
our people

143
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
and the i.t guy because he is very busy

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
he didn't invent anything new he didn't

145
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
start going into certain trends he just

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,919
took this landing put it into the google

147
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
and he said well i want to sell tickets

148
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,759
well following that name

149
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,160
buy it for me

150
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
we had 11 teams 11 teams moved upwards

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
down and this team moved this direction

152
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
well first of all i will speak about 11

153
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,720
teams

154
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
the first thing that has been done by

155
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
the red team

156
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
they take the name

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,759
so it exploded what's slower

158
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
so they put this exploit you should add

159
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
this word exploit so what is exploit

160
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
it's the complete setup complete theme

161
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,680
complete break in

162
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,360
so i think we'll give you the context

163
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,280
well the value can change

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
so point number four from the bottom

165
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,800
well the link number one is a remote

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
command execution it's the exploit

167
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,039
but it's very complicated

168
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,120
so there's an exploit to create account

169
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
admin account for this system

170
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,759
by just entering this resource for

171
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
example let's take any site

172
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,279
and by simply turning to this site you

173
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,599
can create administrator

174
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,559
no

175
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,519
it's there already

176
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,680
and i think it's directly searched

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
so if you open this google site there's

178
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
an initial code and you have to put this

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
initial code into the console and press

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,040
enter and in this place you should uh

181
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
write the address of the site that you

182
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,399
need

183
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
change the slide please change the slide

184
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,519
and here you should write login and

185
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,399
password

186
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,640
change it

187
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,730
so what do we see

188
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,160
[Music]

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
in 2010 minutes they realized the first

190
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
risk

191
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
this year it was two hours so the tt art

192
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,359
program

193
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,279
they take this team and they send it to

194
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
the internet site and on this site they

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
create a certain user

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,279
and on this side they create a user with

197
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,120
admin rights

198
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
what mostly

199
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,240
so after this what else do you need

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,320
[Music]

201
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
can you go back to the first slide

202
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,360
why do we need do the user needs it but

203
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
if you pay attention to this right

204
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,160
corner

205
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
login exchange

206
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,690
move back

207
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,120
[Music]

208
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,279
you see this form being opened but we

209
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,160
have created admin

210
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,160
account so you put this information here

211
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
let's do it without any confirmation so

212
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
yes we put this information here

213
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,240
we took the login password and what do

214
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
we get the result

215
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,199
yep here it is

216
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,800
and we get access to the site control

217
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
panel and we see here trade

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
trains and possibility of changing price

219
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
tickets as well everything's very simple

220
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
and understandable

221
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
and 11 teams they've done everything

222
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,640
like that the 12th one has a separate

223
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
approach later on i'm going to show you

224
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
and tell me about it

225
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,399
okay

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
i think

227
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,120
that everything that colleagues are

228
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
telling us a changing ticket price on

229
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
the side it's very easy it's so simple

230
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
it's you know impossible to live only in

231
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
the game okay only any game only in the

232
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
game

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
in real life it's much more complicated

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
but still i would like to ask you please

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,720
tell us

236
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
you've told us about the team but

237
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
you're not the only people you do have

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,720
certain tool set and i really do like

239
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,440
this screen because everything happens

240
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,839
on it there's some objectives

241
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,360
executed for example 6633

242
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
and the bigger is the number the more i

243
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
like it 30 000 122.

244
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
can you tell me please how did you

245
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
assemble your own salt how you work with

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
it in which direction should you look at

247
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
in so that we understand that

248
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
longer cable

249
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,279
well in our state

250
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,639
if you look out of the window

251
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
it's the number of security events

252
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
which has been generated by now it's the

253
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,320
cnn so on the top is the cm system

254
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
and the standoff of the second day was

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
us lunch and we see the peak of the

256
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,279
number of security events that

257
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,279
are being registered from all over the

258
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,480
infrastructure 40 000 per second believe

259
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
me 40 000 events per second

260
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,079
which come to this year if the there is

261
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,959
not for cm

262
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,240
security person could look in the eyes

263
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,040
but for this purpose

264
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,279
it's not just for the assembly of these

265
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,120
events but also the possibility of

266
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
bringing content

267
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
and that content that i was speaking

268
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
about

269
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,079
well we put here content which helps us

270
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,800
to follow the chain or maybe some

271
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
event which witnesses about realization

272
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,160
of the uh attack that i put in there

273
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,360
there's another type of even

274
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
it's so called tread hunting rules

275
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,360
and these trade hunting rules with a

276
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
good possibility is that they are false

277
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
well it was generated by a legitimate

278
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,880
process but there are 20

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,360
25

280
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,320
[Music]

281
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
this one says legitimate access this one

282
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,360
says

283
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
illegitimate and by the level of threat

284
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,839
these are already those threats which

285
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,399
already has worked the low level it's

286
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,240
the blue one

287
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
so basically speaking these are not

288
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
incidents

289
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,519
it's scanning

290
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,800
maybe

291
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
a tenth of engines

292
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
things that we do not accept as simple

293
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
incidents because there are millions of

294
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
them

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,959
yellow ones it's those straight running

296
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,959
rules to which you shouldn't pay

297
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
attention to from the point of view of

298
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,000
their multiplicity because they have

299
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,800
both

300
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
legitimate

301
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
rio factory and you have to follow them

302
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,040
but

303
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,440
it has to follow up on the malicious

304
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
code because you know the the

305
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
uh red

306
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
positive examples are used and there are

307
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
good teams which are have the red ones

308
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
so the critical is something critical

309
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,319
that happens

310
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
which allows to attack infrastructure

311
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,399
and or related infrastructure well what

312
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,070
it consists of

313
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,240
[Music]

314
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,399
and also with integration with the cm

315
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
event and probability of realization

316
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
this event also is overlaid on it

317
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
so icm is here

318
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,720
it's too empty nobody has reached

319
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,839
technological segments

320
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,480
big number with the story about symbols

321
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
analysis of the files which are being

322
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,360
delivered through the mail to traffic

323
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,800
somebody being traced to the mail he

324
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,519
pushes the veil and he enters here

325
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,839
well speaking about fission we have more

326
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,759
than 4 000 in the course of the day

327
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
these are files which continuously are

328
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,360
being sent by the red one who is this a

329
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,920
red guy

330
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,120
we don't have red attribution but i have

331
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
it in paper

332
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
unfortunately we have not been doing

333
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,850
[Music]

334
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
look at red dynamics or wide dynamics

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
and do data it's wide dynamics

336
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
wide dynamics it's about the story that

337
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
on a regular basis something happens in

338
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,720
the internet there are bolts google both

339
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
or some other boats which regularly scan

340
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,759
web applications

341
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
which is not a problem

342
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,759
but you still have to pay attention to

343
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,600
them

344
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
the red ones is about vulnerability and

345
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
attempt of uh

346
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
vulnerability attempt of loading some

347
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,638
malicious code into the web application

348
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,839
[Music]

349
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,639
so we do see that these attacks have

350
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,519
been well prepared you know scanners

351
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,279
these are well prepared attacks whether

352
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,680
it's right

353
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,320
they discover new services new

354
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
vulnerabilities and the

355
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,199
analysis

356
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,319
traffic analysis

357
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,280
two

358
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,679
million of events that has been

359
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,160
registered today because

360
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,599
the network uh scanning and brute force

361
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,439
everything's considered as a separate

362
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,840
125 000 it's not a factor that is going

363
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
to fund we see this in the internet

364
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,240
traffic but it did go in the traffic and

365
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,520
for the home it's been uh

366
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
considered as the heavy danger

367
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
okay and we also think about visual

368
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,400
vulnerabilities will be used which teams

369
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,320
what should be there and what shouldn't

370
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,879
be there
