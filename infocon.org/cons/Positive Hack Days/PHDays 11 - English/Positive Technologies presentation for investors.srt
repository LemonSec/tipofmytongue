cities

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,600
companies

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,679
cyber security is the only tool that

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,599
helps us

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,480
to ensure stability and predictability

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,039
of the digital world

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,840
what is cyber security

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,359
and

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
how to earn the money on it we are going

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
to talk with key people from positive

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,840
technologies you will see the people

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,719
who

13

actually with their own hands develop

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,399
the products and services

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,320
who investigate hacker as attacks

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
and who develop business

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,680

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
we are online

19

listeners who have a qr code that will

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,239
help you to ask your questions during

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,438
the presentation please scan the code

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,000
the questions will be collected and

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
after the presentation we are going to

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,280
answer

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,479
them

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,759
will have microphones in the in the hall

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,320
and you can ask your questions from the

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,520
audience

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,759
so let's begin

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,680
let's begin

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
with

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
what is happening in cyber security

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
area

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,560
what are the what kind of attacks we see

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
and this is the person who with his own

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
hands

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,840
takes parts in forensic activities

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
for example he helped us recently to

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,600
investigate the event

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
in root tube alexey novikov

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
welcome

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
good afternoon

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
uh really

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,119
the last three months

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
i sat down and calculated how many days

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
did they have

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
when they didn't work one day in three

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,280
months

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,080
the num amount of sleep is about three

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
to four hours

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,959
a day

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
and this is the same story with all the

56
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,480
people who together with me deals with

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,959
monitoring

58
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,520
investigations who help our customers

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
to make this world more

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
more secure

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,440
the number of applications

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
uh grew by three times

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
uh in comparison to the similar period

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
of the previous year yeah yes

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,959
and i would like to tell you about what

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
is an incident

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
when

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
penetrations happen and

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
how they can

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
influence us all

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,400
in 2014

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
2014

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
we decided to build a new service the

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
analog of google analytics

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
the government agencies published that

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,200
analog at their website

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
it was long ago 2014

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,200
and the service was actually forgotten

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,080
now the hackers found it

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,239
and broke through

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,200
as

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,959
and this picture

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
appeared in all the sites who used that

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
counter this is an example of how

85
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
digital security

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
and digital recklessness

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,159
produce

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
such results the next

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
incident kind of incident can affect any

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
of us for many years

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
we have been talking about smart

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
things

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
smart devices

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,560
refrigerators

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,519
controlled by internet or through the

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
internet and now imagine the same kind

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
of

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
refrigerator

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
with the size of a football field and it

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,358
can be attacked by hackers it happened a

101
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
few months ago the hackers broke

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
through this

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,720
refrigerator

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,919
with 40 tons of food stuff the hackers

105
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,040
found it and from -25

106
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,560
raised the temperature to plus 30 a bit

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
more and in a certain region

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,720
we could have

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,270
um

110
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,840
[Music]

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
food collapse

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
because our

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
cream

114
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,159
would be

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
because someone

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,479
neglected cyber security right now

117
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,479
any ip address

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
which belongs to russia is a potential

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
target

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
uh availability of the iap address in

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,039
the russian territory makes it a

122
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,080
lucrative target for attacks

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
right now

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,240
all those attacks successful attacks

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
published

126
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
to the maximum effect that company was

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,720
um

128
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,199
so leaks are published of ministries

129
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
government agencies companies

130
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
to prove that there was a compromise

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
there that their i.t system was

132
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
compromised a lot of data was leaked out

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,479
of the company including

134
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
the mails

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
of the

136
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
users

137
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,680
including telegram messages

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
from their

139
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
desktops and notebooks

140
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,039
we as a company

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,080
investigate such incidents to understand

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
how hackers attack the companies what

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
are the attack vectors and why they are

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
successful only in real life when

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
counter

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
acting such hackers in real life you can

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
build a product that would help others

148
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
to

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,639
rebuff

150
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
attacks

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,479
vulnerability manager was low and we say

152
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
please install the patch

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,880
you didn't have the patch you have an

154
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
incident in another case

155
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,479
uh

156
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
logs were

157
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,720
not

158
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
collected and

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
hacker

160
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,639
traces were not monitors we have such a

161
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
solution in the third case traffic

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,319
analysis

163
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,440
and the analysis of what is happening in

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
infrastructure wasn't uh didn't take

165
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
place when uh someone downloaded 20

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,360
terabytes of your traffic

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,560
we can discover such attacks we know all

168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
the vectors used by cyber criminals and

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
we have our

170
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
experience of

171
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
dealing with each and every vector of

172
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,680
this kind to help the customers to

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,440
disclose hackers on time but products is

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
not everything

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
apart from products you must have

176
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,840
appropriate

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,919
processes and people

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
who can use

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
our products in the right way who

180
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
understand what the products are about

181
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
and here we see the greatest problem

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
the key to success

183
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
uh

184
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
include two factors first the products

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
capable of covering all the attack

186
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
vectors and second

187
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
the people and we have the problem with

188
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
the people and my colleague is going to

189
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,080
tell you about that

190
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,919
part of the problem

191
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
he is developing

192
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
the o2 product

193
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,199
hi

194
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
hi everyone

195
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
alexa told us about recent incidents we

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,039
all agree that they are not

197
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,399
acceptable and to make them impossible

198
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,479
we need a team of at least 25

199
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,080
skilled cybersex specialists

200
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,640
the first layer of defense the second

201
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,320
layer of defense forensic specialists

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,200
for such companies as burbank has

203
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
more than 20

204
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,320
cyber security specialists

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
in russia we have about 2 000 large

206
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
companies

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,839
telecom i.t manufacturing government

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,680
agencies and each

209
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
company has it

210
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
needs a team

211
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
like 2 000 people in spurbank so

212
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,279
overall we need 50 000 cyber security

213
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
specialists in the market

214
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
unfortunately

215
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
we have much

216
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
fewer

217
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
we have only 1 000 instead of

218
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
50 000

219
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
we have we can cover only 40 companies

220
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
out of 2000

221
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
and the cyber security is an acute

222
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,120
problem right now we in positive

223
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
technologies

224
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
have an ambitious goal

225
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
to build a principally new product

226
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
absolutely new product who could uh

227
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
eliminate

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
unacceptable

229
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
attacks

230
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,720
who could work with all our products

231
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,279
with the same efficiency but

232
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,360
operated by one person

233
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,120
it could work automatically

234
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
it's an automatic cyber sec

235
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,240
product and we have everything we need

236
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,880
for that we have the best hacker team

237
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
thanks to which we know how to

238
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,160
uh compromise the companies what kind of

239
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
tools i use what kind of actions are

240
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
taken and

241
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,839
why they act this way in not the other

242
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,399
way we have an excellent team for

243
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,920
monitoring and forensic

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
research

245
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,760
which helps us to develop the right

246
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,079
technologies to disclose hackers which

247
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,640
we use in our products

248
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,680
plus

249
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
besides

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
we have a powerful developer team

251
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
and we already created a number of

252
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
successful products max battle ocm is

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,760
the leader in russia

254
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,720
in 2015 when we entered the market

255
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
it was highly competitive and mature

256
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
market according to idc

257
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,519
it's one of the top 20 worldwide cm

258
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,560
solutions where one of the three leaders

259
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,519
with the most impressive dynamic of

260
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
sales growth

261
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
another product application firewall

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
from release one became

263
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
a gartner visionary in the gartner

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
quadrant network attack discovery

265
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,399
when we developed it

266
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
there were no such solutions at all

267
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
today it's a mainstream according to the

268
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
gardner and the main technology for any

269
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,079
monitoring center

270
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
o2 is located now uh let me uh tell you

271
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
about automatic pilots so first proof of

272
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,200
concept engine

273
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
uh when we can stop

274
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,880
on time then a long

275
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,920
and

276
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
story a long

277
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,560
process with a lot of data then we go to

278
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
the street

279
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,440
it was late

280
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
short route

281
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,360
and then longer routes and then you can

282
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
order pilot a pilotless taxi 02

283
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,120
a year ago at our

284
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,440
10th positive hack days

285
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
we presented our concept

286
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
of max o2 we used it

287
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
for a year collected data

288
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
deployed different algorithms change

289
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
some modules

290
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,000
now

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,959
we are carrying out cyber

292
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,200
exercises with an external team

293
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,360
where we use o2

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
and you can

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
get acquainted with the exercises in the

296
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
main hall

297
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
the next step

298
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
that we are approaching is

299
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,639
first pilots

300
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
with the customers

301
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,199
with our assistance and to conclude

302
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,680
another

303
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
step would be

304
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
cyber exercises

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
on infrastructure of the customer by the

306
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,839
infrastructure why do we need

307
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,199
cyber

308
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,839
exercises yaroslav is going to tell you

309
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,240
about that

310
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,800
sorry something is wrong

311
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
look for example

312
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,160
business

313
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,199
bought

314
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,240
products

315
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
deployed them tuned all the cybersec

316
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,760
processes

317
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,720
has

318
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
hired

319
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
forensic specialists

320
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,040
but how to be sure

321
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
that by using all those things the

322
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,360
company

323
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
cannot be

324
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
penetrated that hackers

325
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,399
cannot

326
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
deploy unacceptable scenarios

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
so

328
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
the first

329
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
way is to wait until the first attack

330
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,079
takes place and see what happens

331
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
in real life

332
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,560
second way is

333
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
to carry out cyber exercises call the

334
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
hackers

335
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
who will demonstrate whether your

336
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,560
business is protected or not can it

337
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,160
repulse hacker attacks you can call 10

338
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,320
hackers you can call 20 50 hackers

339
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
but the

340
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
uh

341
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
each hacker has his own

342
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,800
tools his background his ways

343
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,519
on how to approach the system to break

344
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
through

345
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
and that is why

346
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,399
you don't need 50 hackers

347
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,839
but a thousand or better 2 000.

348
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,680
but how to collect them how to find them

349
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
people who

350
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
will come and demonstrate your

351
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
vulnerability without telling anybody

352
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:52,959
else

353
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
about them

354
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
if they will say well you have such and

355
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,959
such vulnerabilities we got access to

356
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,680
such and such data please close the gaps

357
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,000
and you close that how to collect this

358
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
kind of community we are a hacker

359
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,680
company

360
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
we carry out this uh positive hectares

361
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,839
from 2008 we carry out exercises from

362
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,040
2016 we had nine of them and the targets

363
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
of the hackers

364
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,279
during the exercises is to demonstrate

365
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,839
how unstable the cyber world is

366
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,320
they come and they break

367
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
banks

368
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
manufacturing enterprises government

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,199
agencies

370
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
hackers

371
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
are not are capable not only to find

372
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,839
some minor errors but they can stop

373
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,160
industrial processes and put your

374
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
business to an end to an end now we have

375
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
standoff right now in the main hall

376
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,399
you have hacker teams there

377
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,680
and we have about

378
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,320
160 ethical hackers cyber security

379
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
specialists it's better to say this way

380
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,599
but we want to go on and make another

381
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,480
step

382
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,559
we developed and today

383
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,079
we present the back bounty platform

384
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,439
which

385
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
makes it possible

386
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,359
for the business to ask hackers to come

387
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,160
and demonstrate how

388
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
protected or unprotected the

389
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,079
infrastructure is

390
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,520
but

391
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
that is why

392
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,919
the cybersecurity way is

393
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,280
goes through

394
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,559
cyber exercises and cyber

395
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,600
hackers

396
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,640
taking part in those exercises

397
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,679
look

398
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,880
in a technological company

399
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,679
like positive technologies people are

400
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
the main asset

401
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
the people who

402
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,799
carry out research and development of

403
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
the products that are successful in the

404
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,320
market as alexis said the modern world

405
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
is very vulnerable

406
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
and even refrigerators

407
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,640
can be attacked

408
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,679
and the whole region may suffer

409
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,039
so that's why it's important to have

410
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,919
people in every company people capable

411
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,640
of protecting the infrastructure against

412
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,960
such

413
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
potentially dangerous penetrations

414
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,559
what is the word what does the world of

415
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,360
cyber security now web application

416
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,559
firewalls anti-viruses cms a lot of

417
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
things

418
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,640
but

419
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
what is next

420
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,960
next

421
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,520
automation

422
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
of uh

423
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
dealing with hacker attacks imagine what

424
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
kind of

425
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,960
flood we have now and the russian

426
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
economy uh is very interesting for

427
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,559
international hackers how can we deal

428
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,080
with that through automation alone

429
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,400
and we don't have any examples of such

430
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
automation it's a revolutionary step

431
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,760
that

432
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,559
happened with the motor car

433
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,080
so we had to know how to deal with the

434
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,200
engine

435
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
how to

436
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
run it

437
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,280
now we just press the button and we have

438
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,679
the driverless cars it's a true

439
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,679
revolution max petro02 is our

440
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,360
revolutionary product o2 it means

441
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
disclose and stop

442
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
the attack before it causes you an

443
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,960
unacceptable damage

444
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
it's a principle revolutionary step

445
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,520
how to check

446
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,799
even if you have an automatic

447
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,840
cyber security product how to check

448
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,160
whether your infrastructure is really

449
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,559
protected only through

450
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,679
real cyber exercises

451
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,640
based on your infrastructure

452
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
and that's why

453
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,120
we carry out our standoffs

454
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,760
and announce the back bounty program

455
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
it's a platform for the company

456
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
which helps everyone to come

457
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
to be to install their product on that

458
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
platform

459
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,960
and

460
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,640
break your product

461
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,200
for your benefit for your good for you

462
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,080
to learn and to make your product more

463
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,120
secure what do we do with all our

464
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
expertise technologies and products how

465
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,600
successful are we maxim philippe he is a

466
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,559
person

467
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,919
who feels every ruble in the market of

468
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
cyber security

469
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
hello

470
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,640
when i was listening to the speakers i

471
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
saw they are

472
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,000
technical people but now i'll give

473
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
i'll have a more difficult presentation

474
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,840
than theirs look last year

475
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
our business strategy the previous one

476
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
came to an end we wanted to

477
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,080
have double growth every two years

478
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,280
we started when our revenues were about

479
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,039
2 billion

480
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,440
in 3 years

481
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,600
we implemented that strategy

482
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,520
so we have to adopt a new one

483
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,039
so we doubled in three years we want to

484
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,559
double in one year

485
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
we need to build the business in such a

486
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,559
way

487
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,640
we need such technologies that would

488
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,559
help us to double

489
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
every year

490
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
they said max

491
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
your target is to come

492
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
and explain why

493
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,120
uh

494
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
we're going to achieve that goal we

495
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,760
achieve by dividing if a person

496
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,720
is

497
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
sincere and he is going to do his job

498
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,440
we shall reach the target

499
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,840
sales

500
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,559
be still

501
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
took the responsibility and we are going

502
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,480
to

503
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,760
be successful so at this point i could

504
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,559
have ended my presentation but this is

505
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,000
too little we have to tell you what are

506
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
the main drivers of

507
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
our business success

508
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,760
i sat down and put them down on paper we

509
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
have more than

510
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
20 i have only 10 minutes

511
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,280
so i prepared top five

512
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,760
for my expert opinion they are the main

513
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,200
drivers that are going to

514
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,919
help us succeed

515
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
see in the market now what alexey

516
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,200
novikov

517
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,440
said in the last three months

518
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
they he didn't sleep or he didn't work

519
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,880
for one day only and he sleep

520
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,919
three to four hours a day

521
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
uh our hackers do the same demacia

522
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,039
branikov and all the others

523
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,159
we see growing demand in q1

524
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,799
you can see

525
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,919
protection analysis by two times

526
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,640
forensic activities by three times

527
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
risk

528
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
oriented projects by five times what do

529
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
i mean by risk oriented for example the

530
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,279
customer feels bad

531
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
as certain

532
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
critical business process is down he

533
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,720
says please do something i want to leave

534
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,279
oh he comes before

535
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,720
her hand

536
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
i am attacked

537
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,279
i am afraid of unacceptable law says

538
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
please help me

539
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,840
it's a good driver for us the main one

540
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
why historically

541
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
positive technologies at such points

542
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,960
when something unacceptable happens with

543
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
the customer

544
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,760
we're not talking about the money

545
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,080
we're not saying that we're going to

546
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,200
help you but you have to pay this much

547
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
we just help him

548
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,080
on the one hand because yes we are

549
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
greedy

550
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
we understand

551
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,039
it you understand new kinds of cracker

552
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,840
attacks new vulnerabilities that we use

553
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,400
in our products and capitalize

554
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,120
but

555
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,880
due to the fact that customers are happy

556
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
and alexey and dima are skilled once

557
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,720
and they say

558
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,679
the customers say

559
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,120
thank you

560
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,600
but then we commercialize that thank you

561
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,159
through selling our products and

562
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,600
services

563
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
and we get a lot of revenues as a result

564
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760
and we see the

565
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
the growing demand

566
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
on our experts and it means

567
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,440
better capitalization this is trend

568
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,640
number one second

569
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,720
security focus on result on may 1

570
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,400
we saw the presidential decree about

571
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
digital security historically

572
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
cyber sec

573
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,919
industry

574
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,440
so the main driver was normative basis

575
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,320
unless we have a law unless we are held

576
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
responsible we are not going to do

577
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,559
anything now the situation is different

578
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,120
everyone is working without waiting for

579
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
this decree because there is no other

580
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,080
way

581
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,039
look by 2000 by january 1 2025

582
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
any

583
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,720
security solutions of non-friendly

584
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
countries must be

585
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,120
prohibited

586
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
yes

587
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
somebody hasn't got the products others

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,799
have lost their licenses

589
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,120
yet others have no support for us

590
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,679
this story is more important than just

591
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,960
regulation why because as you know we've

592
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,159
heard a message from the market

593
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,559
that people are not happy with uh

594
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,440
information secure cyber security

595
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
and uh about three years ago

596
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,760
uh we had this concept uh born in our

597
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,279
company that we called information

598
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,799
security 2.0 let me remind you if you're

599
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,240
hearing about this for the first time

600
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
firstly

601
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,200
make

602
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,279
the goal of your cyber security to make

603
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,360
uh inadmissible business events

604
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
impossible this should be the goal of

605
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
cyber security it's not about

606
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
implementing projects or technologies

607
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,440
just call an inadmissible event

608
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,400
and make it impossible

609
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,279
it's impossible to

610
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
name these events without being in

611
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,480
dialogue over the number one in the

612
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,200
company and this degree uh in our

613
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,799
opinion is a movement in this direction

614
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,919
uh is

615
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,960
about the industry has partly moved

616
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,559
in the direction

617
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,600
of the philosophy that we have proposed

618
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,480
it says that in all companies uh

619
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
deputy

620
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,440
ceos should

621
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,320
appear responsible for incidents

622
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,520
and

623
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,720
in addition to that the list of

624
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,080
companies

625
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,440
to which the decree applies

626
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
are measured in hundreds of thousands

627
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,120
as to the deadline uh first of january

628
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
2025 a lot of people are saying uh come

629
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,840
i mean

630
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,760
uh there's a lot of time uh why so

631
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,960
long

632
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,360
implementing a system

633
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,520
in information security or a separate

634
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,320
technology is quite a lengthy process so

635
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,919
in our opinion

636
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,000
the year 2025

637
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,200
is a very

638
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,600
short time

639
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,520
information security 2.0 and the

640
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
president decree and the regulations

641
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,399
that turn towards practical security are

642
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
the drivers are

643
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,480
the drivers for our business number two

644
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,799
the driver number three

645
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,679
it's about a metaproduct concept there's

646
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,919
a certain methodology and philosophy in

647
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,919
admissible events

648
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,279
making them impossible and there's some

649
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,279
technical solution

650
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,440
that allows

651
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,159
making uh this methodology work in real

652
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,120
life you've seen the status

653
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
of readiness

654
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,360
of the auto release where we are

655
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,240
we

656
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,039
myself personally i'm expecting

657
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,159
the

658
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,000
technical release by the end of this

659
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,880
year

660
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
so far this

661
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,840
story is collected from uh

662
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
well collected manually but we need to

663
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,919
have a commercial release why are you

664
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,320
drawing up o2 here if you don't even

665
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
have a commercial release of this

666
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,559
project

667
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,120
product let me explain

668
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,000
look

669
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,279
the positive technology is sales people

670
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,200
are not people who sell products they

671
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,240
sell ideas and meanings

672
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
they are bringing ideas to the industry

673
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
they are selling these ideas and

674
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,039
meanings to customers and then there's a

675
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,120
question where to move we are prepared

676
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,600
to take up this guidance

677
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,080
this is right but uh what to do next and

678
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
we're saying yes

679
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,159
yes and they say uh well okay uh where's

680
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
the technical release you're drawing or

681
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,320
two for us but it's not yet in existence

682
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
in order

683
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,360
that the o2 products should correctly

684
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,919
function in the customer infrastructure

685
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,960
it needs to have an enriched

686
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,919
context that is

687
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,960
uploaded

688
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,559
from other products that we have at the

689
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,200
bottom and so we found the script let's

690
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,159
start

691
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,320
by putting sensors and other uh positive

692
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,799
products in your infrastructure and it's

693
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,919
also

694
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,240
a process that takes quite a lot of time

695
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,360
so

696
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,760
basically we're preparing the customer's

697
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
infrastructure

698
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
for the

699
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,039
emergence of this meta product and this

700
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,000
is

701
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,760
the driver that you know pushes

702
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
our business even now

703
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,039
number four

704
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,519
is is not going away it's about our new

705
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,000
products uh that

706
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,559
we launch quite regularly

707
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,600
help

708
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
uh three and the last the latest three

709
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,200
vm was released last year

710
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,960
we already have more than ten

711
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,399
implementations uh the xdr was released

712
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,880
uh earlier this year or late last year

713
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,360
last year and the first pilots this year

714
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,080
and bug bounty is being announced today

715
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,159
we already have customers in the current

716
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,600
situation

717
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,399
they

718
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,000
got

719
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
hooked

720
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,880
to

721
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,360
the hacker one service but because of

722
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,519
the current event they can no longer use

723
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,960
the service and they came to positive

724
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
they don't stay positive can you do

725
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,600
something uh we need that

726
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
okay you're welcome tomorrow we are

727
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,240
launching the bug biology platform and

728
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,559
all customers will be able to use it

729
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,519
why

730
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,519
all these new products are so important

731
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
why am i saying that it's one of the

732
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,200
top five drivers for positive because

733
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,159
talking

734
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,559
from the business perspective

735
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,559
we are entering a technology segment

736
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,399
where uh we had not existed earlier and

737
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,840
looking forward we're only going to

738
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,480
expand so all the technology segments

739
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
that uh positive has been playing in the

740
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,360
next two or three years we are either to

741
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,120
become a business leader in this segment

742
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,240
or

743
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,679
we are becoming uh one of other such

744
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,960
leaders

745
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,640
so the story of new products for

746
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,679
positive

747
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
is extremely important it was driver

748
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,880
number four

749
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,840
driver number five

750
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,240
my expert assessment

751
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,200
i

752
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,320
assess

753
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,880
the total information security markets

754
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,039
of 2021

755
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,519
at the level of 200 billion rupees

756
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,919
the list of companies that left the

757
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,640
russian market

758
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,760
is

759
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
on the right and by the way it's one

760
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,039
third i think is going to be longer

761
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,760
if you take the information as of today

762
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,120
i

763
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,159
assess

764
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,919
the released market size at 80 million

765
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,440
what's going to happen

766
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,080
frankly i'm not sure whether the market

767
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
is going to grow or go down and the

768
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
challenge is not there

769
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,200
so the

770
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,679
uh fights will not be about the growth

771
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,360
of the total addressable markets but

772
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,799
the uh

773
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,480
segment released

774
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,120
accounts for 40 of total market and now

775
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
the fight

776
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,279
is going to happen in the segment of

777
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,279
that used to be controlled by western

778
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,399
vendors

779
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,080
that left the russian market and this

780
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,399
trend

781
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,320
top five how has it impacted

782
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,799
the positive business so this is the

783
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,039
freshest data the results of q1 2022.

784
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,480
our business

785
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,200
year and year has grown three times this

786
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,360
is the sales volume the revenue what

787
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,840
we've already

788
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,640
sold

789
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
you're going to ask me what's going to

790
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,639
come next is it going to

791
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,560
grow as fast no

792
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,480
i will say the peak

793
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,520
is

794
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
has been passed

795
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
from april and may we already see a

796
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,800
certain decline

797
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,599
against this growth of course but on the

798
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,639
whole

799
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
our forecasts today

800
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,560
are at the level of x2 that's why

801
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,918
doubling the

802
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,839
result of the previous calendar year

803
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,599
my story would probably not to be honest

804
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,760
enough and not complete enough

805
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,280
had i concentrated your opinion

806
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,839
only on these five

807
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,520
drivers because you

808
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,320
might

809
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,679
get an impression

810
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,639
that

811
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,560
we are you know

812
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,440
uh champions of cyber security

813
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
everything is going itself into our

814
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,320
hands and the only thing is to catch all

815
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
these new opportunities

816
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
i

817
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,560
honestly

818
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,520
believe

819
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
that the main factor

820
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,760
to achieve

821
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
success

822
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,640
is in internal changes we

823
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,920
as a company are changing

824
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,040
within ourselves to address a

825
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
next level

826
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
objective

827
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,599
so

828
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,320
we need to change to grow twice on the

829
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,960
previous year this slide is not totally

830
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,000
true

831
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
this slide is about numbers

832
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,960
but we need to see meanings and

833
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,839
approaches changed we are changing them

834
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,599
we're changing ourselves see but we have

835
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,520
new roles in our company for instance

836
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,359
there are product business leaders

837
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,720
appearing in the company now we have

838
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
eight people like that who are these

839
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,200
people these are people who are

840
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
responsible for the commercial success

841
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
of separate products

842
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,119
if

843
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
the positive sales force is responsible

844
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,359
for the happiness of the end user

845
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,400
and

846
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,560
the financial results from the customer

847
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,680
and these guys they are responsible

848
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,960
for

849
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,119
the

850
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,800
product

851
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,720
financial response

852
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,359
and by the way

853
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,640
frankly

854
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,680
positive

855
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,280
has

856
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,640
now become

857
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,400
a very

858
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,280
touted employer in the cyber security

859
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,760

861
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,640
attract strong people over the past

proficient guide from them

it's not a full list by the way we as a

870
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,520
positive have become a very attractive

871
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,880

we can take the best

873
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
from the labor market

874
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,119
and

875
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,160
we

876
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,399
can

877
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,320
make them

878
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,599
believe in our

879
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,400
goals and values and then how we can

880
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,960
make sure that we achieve the results

881
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,119
and so you can ask you may ask her why

882
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,119
do we need such a great growth in head

883
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,040
count for instance so we've got twice as

884
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,280
many sales people now look the answer is

885
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
quite simple

886
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
several years ago we only had one

887
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,560
product for the enterprise market and

888
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,920
there were up to 1 000 customers per one

889
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,880
sales per salesperson well the product

890
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,520
was simple you only need to do the

891
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,400
paperwork now we have set a task for

892
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
every positive salesperson

893
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
not only to sell a product to the

894
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,560
customer but also to achieve the goals

895
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,640
for this uh you need to sell the idea

896
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,200
and the goal uh set the idea

897
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,320
set the goal

898
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
to create to make inadmissible events

899
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
impossible

900
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
you have 15 products in the market

901
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,520
and to do such

902
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,760
a thorough work in a single

903
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,359
customer

904
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,800
if you have to work with a thousand

905
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,160
customers is just impossible so our main

906
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,000
concept is that

907
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,880
either we have one sales person or for

908
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,920
one customer or even we have cases where

909
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,760
we have several sales people

910
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,480
for one customer because that requires a

911
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
lot of thorough work

912
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,720
because you need to implement new ideas

913
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,759
so in my opinion

914
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
achieving the result is only possible

915
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,800
through

916
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,400
and i think

917
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,920
that it's

918
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,000
making people with another company

919
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
believe uh in our goals and values and

920
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
so this is the main driver for our

921
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
business strategy so our business

922
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,240
strategy is x2

923
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,400
thank you that's it all i want all i

924
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,599
have to say thank you max

925
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,160
it's uh quite curious

926
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,320
in my understanding

927
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,760
of a person responsible for sales

928
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,440
and commerce

929
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,760
quite often these are

930
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
people with

931
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,680
no principles at all so who would do

932
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,359
anything to grab the money from the

933
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,480
market but as you've noticed maxim

934
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,800
talks a lot about

935
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
making people share

936
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
the goals and values that they're

937
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,480
working for which makes this approach

938
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,400
very different because if you as a

939
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,720
person responsible for development of

940
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,400
sales if you have shining eyes then your

941
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,119
uh

942
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,680
attitude to the customer will be

943
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,200
absolutely different and the customer's

944
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,280
attitude to you will also be different

945
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,359
maxim told us

946
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,160
what kind of money uh we are getting

947
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
from the market and ala mccarroll our

948
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,880
cfo will tell you

949
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,560
how

950
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,800
within positive

951
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,040
financial component is structured thank

952
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,440
you hello

953
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,599
uh happy to greet you all here my name

954
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,839
is ali makarova i'm responsible for

955
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,800
finance in positive and let's continue

956
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,079
uh

957
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,160
talking on the in the language of

958
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,119
numbers i think max has set a very good

959
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,319
direction for our today's presentation

960
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,319
i'd like to continue i'd like to show

961
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,119
you

962
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,680
uh in a bit more detail

963
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,839
in numbers how all these

964
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,400
developments

965
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,359
directions will be converted into the

966
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,880
growth of financial indicators of

967
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,040
possible and there's a result in the

968
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
growth of the market capitalization once

969
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,599
again about fails max told a lot but i

970
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,000
would like to focus because indeed

971
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,839
perhaps it's the key factor of our

972
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,319
success is something that drives

973
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,119
uh all of our development and it's

974
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,920
important that the direction that we're

975
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
setting

976
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,200
should be implemented doubling our

977
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,400
business

978
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,200
uh

979
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,839
3 6 4 8 12 and you can easily

980
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,960
continue this mathematical sequence

981
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,800
suppose that

982
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,839
this trend stays these dynamics stays

983
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,680
and so we're

984
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,960
hoping for that a lot

985
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,960
the ambition that

986
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,079
we are setting for ourselves to

987
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,440
achieve

988
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
the

989
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,599
market share in the addressable market

990
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,280
so 50

991
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,760
it does not seem too

992
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,560
high

993
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
it

994
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,920
seems to be quite

995
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,079
achievable and we're going there the

996
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,760
successful results of q1 confirm uh the

997
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,119
positive forecasts and we're hoping that

998
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,839
this year our sales will be between 12

999
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,800
and 15 billion rubles which will help

1000
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
help us

1001
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,119
to

1002
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,800
grow the revenue

1003
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,960
so what's important for us regarding

1004
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,000
revenue historically

1005
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,200
we

1006
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,960
have been

1007
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,079
developing

1008
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,280
as a vendor

1009
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,480
we were focusing on

1010
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,040
the sales of licensees

1011
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,119
and if you take a previous period like

1012
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,800
for instance 2018

1013
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,359
the share of our product the licensing

1014
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,440
revenue was about 82 percent

1015
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,119
of our portfolio

1016
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,480
and then it has greatly grown last year

1017
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,200
it was 85 this year

1018
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,240
we are setting a target of making it 90

1019
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,440
it doesn't mean

1020
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,240
that the revenue from services is going

1021
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,200
down

1022
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,760
in absolute terms it is growing

1023
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,440
because

1024
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,240
our services

1025
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
in information security

1026
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,400
and monitoring

1027
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,960
that alexei talked about

1028
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,240
uh pen test services extended support

1029
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
uh developing uh hardware and software

1030
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,000
solutions they're all part of our

1031
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,839
business and of course they are all

1032
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,480
needed for the development our products

1033
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
in the first place we're doing it

1034
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,359
to

1035
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,280
improve our expertise and to bring this

1036
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,520
expertise into our products but still as

1037
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,800
a vendor we are setting a strategy of

1038
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,720
growing

1039
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,520
the sales of our products because

1040
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,400
this

1041
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,319
is a higher margin

1042
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,359
business and it will give us a growth of

1043
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,119
a gross

1044
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,280
income up to 90 percent looking forward

1045
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,599
an important factor of positives

1046
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,000
financial success is that we are an

1047
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,040
operationally efficient company

1048
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,400
we

1049
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,720
always

1050
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,319
controlled our

1051
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,520
costs

1052
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,160
and for us it's important that

1053
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,920
the rate of growth of our costs has have

1054
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,560
not uh been uh over

1055
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,880
stepping the growth of revenues

1056
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,040
uh they said we have been developing

1057
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,839
quite fast we have been adding the head

1058
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,040
head count

1059
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
this year we have a record-breaking

1060
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,119
number of vacancies about 300

1061
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,599
in the past year we've been in actively

1062
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,960
investing in marketing pre-sale

1063
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,079
activities sales support pr but it's

1064
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,560
important that with this we have

1065
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,440
maintained a high uh operating uh

1066
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,960
profitability the operating income uh

1067
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,119
before ebitda

1068
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,480
in the previous year i was 2.9 billion

1069
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,599
rubles

1070
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,079
and the profitability on this indicator

1071
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,240
achieved 41 percent

1072
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,599
so

1073
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,599
uh considering our strategy

1074
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,359
and the plans for this year

1075
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,480
we expect uh the ebitda

1076
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,599
will

1077
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,800
achieve

1078
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,319
uh four to six billion uh we are

1079
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,880
planning we're hoping uh to

1080
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,800
bring the profitability up to forty to

1081
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,760
forty five percent and in the mid-term

1082
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,960
horizon

1083
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,560
we

1084
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,359
set an aim uh to bring profitability to

1085
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,319
50

1086
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,599
it all makes

1087
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,920
uh positive one of the most successful

1088
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,920
companies not only in russia

1089
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,960
but uh also among

1090
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,720
western uh

1091
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,560
cyber security

1092
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,119
companies

1093
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,960
it is important

1094
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,880
that we

1095
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,960
maintaining quite a high level of

1096
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,040
investment in product development

1097
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,560
based on the results

1098
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,359
of

1099
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,480
the year 2021 our capital investments

1100
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,040
and r d investment

1101
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,759
comprised

1102
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,599
1.3 billion rubles and this year we're

1103
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,880
planning to grow it by 30 to 35 percent

1104
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
we believe it's important so we uh are

1105
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,800
going to keep developing our

1106
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,160
technologies

1107
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,319
the products uh that

1108
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,680
will uh form parts of the holistic cyber

1109
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,839
security

1110
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,240
what is the solution

1111
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,720
but they said we also maintained the

1112
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,200
free cash flow the in q1 this year the

1113
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,520
cash flow has grown by

1114
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,440
70 percent

1115
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,720
and we're expecting it to uh maintain

1116
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,000
this way until yes this year uh we also

1117
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,560
do that uh the uh

1118
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,640
keeping uh the debt

1119
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
uh quite low

1120
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,599
so the

1121
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,040
net debt

1122
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,880
is

1123
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,640
has gone down to 0.2 0.3

1124
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,040
so it all allowed us to pay out the

1125
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,640
dividend for the previous year the

1126
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,759
dividend was paid last week

1127
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,839
and considering uh the interim dividends

1128
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,160
that were paid last year the total

1129
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,520
uh payout was 1.3 billion

1130
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,240
in conclusion i would also unlike

1131
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
to sum up what my colleagues have said

1132
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,800
earlier what's important

1133
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
to understand the main factors of a

1134
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,440
positive success and why we

1135
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,680
are and are going to remain and attract

1136
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,520
investment attractive company

1137
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,720
positive

1138

1139
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,160
information security we have a huge

1140
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,720
product lineup we have unique expertise

1141
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,319
and our meta products

1142
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,280
exactly the response to

1143
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,160
the ask the demands that are being

1144
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,640
shaped in the current realities

1145
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,359
in the world where threats are growing

1146
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,720
and requirements for information

1147
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,760

1149
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,599
competitive position we work with a lot

1150
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,920

1151
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,200
we keep transforming our sales system

1152
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,280
we keep investing in growth

we also have a huge potential for

1154
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,160
growing even more

1155
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,800

russia i'm hoping is one of the most

1159
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,000
dynamic today and we are hoping that

1160
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,640
this dynamic will

1161
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,760
stay

1162
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,079

as an iit company from the government in

1168
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,119
terms of tax

1169
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,319

preferences for our employees it all

1171
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,680
allows us

to invest more and more dynamically in r

1173

importantly we are a public company and

1177
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,640

1178
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,559
shareholders uh

1179

um

1186
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,200
it's a very

1187
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,920
these are a very clear and exciting

1188
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,240
investment attractiveness factors but i

1189
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,359
would also be interested how uh these

1190
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,839
factors

1191
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,160
impact the interest of investors to

1192
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,280
positive shares how it looks in practice

1193
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,079
uh maxim poster void you see oh well

1194
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359

so my part of the presentation is almost

1197
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,240
the last one it's about how positive uh

1198
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,880
feels itself and will feel itself

1199
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,119
as a public company

1200
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,079

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,920
that we've got listed yes i have some

1203
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,400
numbers some graphs some indicators i

1204

could start with that showing how great

1205
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,440
we are but i would uh rather make a step

1206
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,400
back to december 2021

1207
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,920
to recall

1208
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,960
why we at positive decided to

1209
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,440
get listed in the exchange because

1210
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,400

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,800
experts about our financial indicators

1213
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,559
it would all have been the same

1214
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,960
had we been a public company or had we

1215
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,839
not

1216
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,280
there are two

1217
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,720
reasons why we decided to go to the

1218
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,839
market well they were like this we want

1219
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,200
positive

1220
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,359
to

1221
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,000
turn from a company of 12 to 1300 people

1222
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,119
but we wanted to become a company a part

1223
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,520
of which which uh could be purchased by

1224
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,720
any investor in russia or even worldwide

1225
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,319
we want to have co-investors

1226
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:36,960
co-participants

1227
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,960
in the broadest range of people who

1228
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,839
understand that i.t the id industry and

1229
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,119
more than that

1230
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,359
more narrow segments cyber security is

1231
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,400
exciting

1232
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,480
it's exciting in essence it's exciting

1233
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,559
in terms of investment and they would

1234
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,599
like to be part of it we were wanted

1235
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,359
that positive

1236
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,040
uh should

1237
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,720
uh

1238
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,079
expand uh from a company having

1239
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,280
1200 or 1300 people that

1240
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,440
expand to encompass anyone who would

1241
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,599
like to be part of it that was the first

1242
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,599
goal and the second goal

1243
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,440
was to make it so that positive and its

1244
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,559
shares

1245
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,079
should be

1246
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,359
liquid should be

1247
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,440
justly evaluated so that positive shares

1248
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,680
uh could be used to reward people who

1249
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,079
are bringing value uh to improve the

1250
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,079
company capitalization

1251
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,200
but the world has not invented another

1252
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,520
mechanism to achieve these two goals

1253
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,760
rather than going uh to the stock

1254
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,800
exchange

1255
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,200
so coming back to the first goal

1256
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,400
have we been able to grow our family

1257
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,319
to extend the

1258
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,400
positive perimeter i remind you that at

1259
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,240
the moment of the trading starts

1260
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,559
the owners of shares that got

1261
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,559
to the exchange were our employees at

1262
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,839
that time and about 200 former employees

1263
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,000
that took part in the development of

1264
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,920
positive so in total about 1400 people

1265
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,960
but what happened next

1266
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,160
so this is the point that we started at

1267
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,040
and actually every month

1268
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,240
uh of course we have to deduct the month

1269
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,319
uh where the exchange in work the number

1270
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,640
of our shareholders was growing uh by

1271
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,720
ten thousand people ten thousand people

1272
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,960
a month

1273
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,000
as of the uh as of the middle of april

1274
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,359
we had 44 000. we don't have exact data

1275
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,040
as of today but i think it's more than

1276
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,440
50 000. today positive is one of the

1277
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,319
uh most so diverse in terms of public

1278
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,079
over private investment companies in

1279
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,880
russia and this only in six months

1280
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,480
somebody at the beginning of the story

1281
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,720
told us look 100 000

1282
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,559
is

1283
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,359
kind of a cosmic number you're going to

1284
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,880
have a hundred thousand shareholders uh

1285
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,880
you can believe yourself to be part uh

1286
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,599
of the very utmost leaders i don't see

1287
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,839
it as a very aggressive uh

1288
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,079
goal this is not the goal that we are

1289
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,920
prepared uh to

1290
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,160
uh look forward to of course we'll break

1291
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,760
through this level and go forward how

1292
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,359
many private investors are there in

1293
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,680
russia i think it's about several

1294
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,920
million i think that right

1295
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,680
two or three million

1296
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,359
well there's a difference active or

1297
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,000
not active so a million is a noble

1298
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,800
normal measure how many investors we

1299
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
want to have

1300
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,680
and so what about valuation is it uh

1301
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,880
just

1302
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,839
is it fair has the market

1303
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,280
valued positive here you see two graphs

1304
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,520
first the first is the cost of shares

1305
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,240
the price of shares is dynamic the low

1306
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,599
one is the

1307
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,319
overall index of moscow exchange so how

1308
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,200
most

1309
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,800
companies

1310
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,720
operating in the moscow exchange is in

1311
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,559
moscow exchange

1312
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,559
operating you see there's a single point

1313
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,960
where everything went down it's clear

1314
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,119
it's the end of february

1315
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,319
but after that positive share have not

1316
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,040
only uh recovered their value but we

1317
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,680
actually entered the price of 700 rubles

1318
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,160
that was the first part of the draft of

1319
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,960
the graph they grew today

1320
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,640
i think the 950 960 rubles yes the

1321
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,880
market

1322
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,760
has appreciated positive i don't know if

1323
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,880
the price

1324
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,720
is fair

1325
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,760
but

1326
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,359
what we see is that the market is

1327
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,119
valuing positive

1328
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,599
shares better than that of those of

1329
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,400
other companies working the market and

1330
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,000
there's a clear rationale for that

1331
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,559
positive is the only public company

1332
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,040
from cyber security that's traded in the

1333
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,599
exchange the market is growing

1334
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,440
and the market is not really growing

1335
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,119
above the political event it's been

1336
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,599
growing for several years

1337
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,799
faster

1338
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:01,599
than

1339
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,640
the overall i.t market growth

1340
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,599
yes

1341
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,520
we see

1342
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,359
a growth a huge growth of demands for

1343
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,599
cyber security tools and services from

1344
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,599
all companies large and small

1345
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,480
and

1346
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,480
specifically from our customers large

1347
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,440
enterprises yes we've already said that

1348
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,839
foreign vendors have left the russian

1349
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:24,799
market

1350
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,280
and this is not yet the end of the story

1351
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,720
uh this

1352
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,960
uh outflow is going on it will end

1353
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,880
somewhere and of course positive is one

1354
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,240
of the biggest

1355
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,640
beneficiaries there because it's product

1356
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,240
companies that are leaving and not

1357
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,480
service companies because main business

1358
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,880
for positive is to sell products

1359
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,440
we see an unprecedented supports of the

1360
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,160
government for i.t companies and not all

1361
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,680
i.t companies

1362
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,160
have such preferences as positive has

1363
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,799
it's not enough uh to be an 80 company

1364
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,960
to be entitled to all the

1365
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,200
benefits you have to be a company and

1366
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,599
most parts of who the revenue of which

1367
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,000
are product sales a service company is

1368
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,319
not getting all the preferences

1369
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,240
that the government provides

1370
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,640
positive is one of the few

1371
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,598
main beneficiaries here

1372
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,000
we talked at the previous session that

1373
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,280
positive ambitions are not limited to

1374
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,280
russia and cis the world has is divided

1375
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,960
into three geopolitical blocks the west

1376
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,920
with its cyber security china

1377
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,160
and the rest of the world

1378
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,400
the rest of the world is

1379
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,920
our ambition where we are going to grow

1380
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,880
and sell our solutions

1381
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,240
for governments for industries for

1382
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,799
nations as a whole

1383
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,799
the temporary problem

1384
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:53,839
uh

1385
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,799
is that among our customers we don't

1386
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:00,480
have foreign investments investors many

1387
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,160
russian

1388
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,119
companies have falling

1389
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,359
market shares because

1390
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,400
uh foreign investors were leaving

1391
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,119
we didn't have foreign investors and as

1392
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,359
a result our market

1393
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,520
price uh stock price didn't fall down

1394
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,240
and we continue we're continuously in

1395
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,640
dialogue with investors we work in

1396
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,920
different channels in social media among

1397
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,960
brokers and banks or wherever we can

1398
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,160
talk to investors

1399
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,760
launch q and a sessions online sessions

1400
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,839
and such meetings as today

1401
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,280
in our point of view this is a factor of

1402
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,200
success

1403
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,520
that is going to push our

1404
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,480
stock

1405
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,480
market

1406
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,040
our market price higher and higher

1407
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,880
dividends

1408
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,400
so

1409
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,160
from the moment of ipo

1410
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,359
we are

1411
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,520
tortured about dividends why dividends

1412
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,400
our dividend policy is published in the

1413
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,720
website and we

1414
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,400
committed to

1415
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,839
pay

1416
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,440
most part of their

1417
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,319
net

1418
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,720
profit

1419
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,280
the what has dividends

1420
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,440
we don't need it

1421
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,680
the

1422
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
share price goes up and that is their

1423
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,960
main interest but from our point of view

1424
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,520
uh we have a vicious circle when we have

1425
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,960
a lot of companies i.t companies who are

1426
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,440
growing fast

1427
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,410
and

1428
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,079
[Music]

1429
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,400
they work in debt

1430
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,280
and

1431
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,720
whether the debt is going to be paid for

1432
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,440
or not we know what is happening at the

1433
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,319
stock market

1434
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,760
and we shall see

1435
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,680
who is going to

1436
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,160
survive and who is not

1437
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,400
the company is successful and it

1438
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,799
shouldn't be fast growing only it should

1439
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,400
be profitable as soon as we have profits

1440
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,960
we want to share profits with the

1441

after all the marketing activities we

1445
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,599
have good net profits and we're going to

1446
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,079
share that net profit with the

1447
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,720

in the top league of the public company

invite here a person

1485
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,960
who was hired more than 10 years ago

1486
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,359
he started as a white ethical hacker

1487
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,000
then developed a lot of products now he

1488
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,480
is a general director janice sparanov

1489
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,599
hi everyone thank you for sitting until

1490
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,280
the very end i think it wasn't uh

1491
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,799
very boring

1492
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:48,240
uh we took more than an hour of your

1493
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,440
time i would like to tell you about two

1494
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,440
points point one

1495
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,920
such companies like positive

1496
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,039
uh are done by the team and we wanted to

1497
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,680
present our team

1498
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,920
but we need we have more technical

1499
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,880
specialists standoff specialists

1500
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
developers you could see them in the

1501
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,160
whole but

1502
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,880
the second point why do you need all

1503
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,599
that because in the investment track we

1504
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,359
could have a different

1505
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,319
a whole without torturing you with all

1506
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,599
our abbreviations cdms and

1507
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,799
blah blah blah but the idea was

1508
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,119
as we announced

1509
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,799
a year ago

1510
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,440
when we talked about

1511
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,079
our ipo

1512
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,599

1513
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,920

in our community

1515
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,119
most of the technical people that you

1516
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,520
saw from

chat

1614
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,640
i am going to ask two of them and then

1615
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,960
you'll be able to ask your questions we

1616
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,720
have a group of questions about

1617
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,839
licensing policy

1618
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,640
what is the licensing model of the

1619
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,039
company

1620
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,839
in

1621
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,240
indefinite or definite

1622
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,640
what is the average

1623
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,839
term of the license

1624
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,680
let me ask

1625
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,920
let me answer quickly

1626
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,920
what is the licensing model of the

1627
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,400
company

1628
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,680
there is another question

1629
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,200
please read the next question

1630
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,839
do please the next question is about the

1631
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,680
licensing policy

1632
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,160
yes

1633
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,319
[Music]

1634
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,799
licensing uh indefinite

1635
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,280
so we sell a license for a certain term

1636
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,399
and after a certain term it becomes

1637
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,439
nothing

1638
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,158
so the customer has to stop to use the

1639
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,479
product

1640
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,600
what is the average term

1641
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,640
90

1642
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,000
of licenses are for one year

1643
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,440
about

1644
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,040
and the remaining 2

1645
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:47,759
are

1646
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,040
flexible

1647
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,439
some people say 13 months others say six

1648
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,399
months

1649
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,600
so we satisfy them

1650
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,600
floating term

1651
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,839
now

1652
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,960
how are the sales related to msfo

1653
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:14,319
i told you uh about the share about msfo

1654
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,000
uh let allah say licenses

1655
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,560
in msfo

1656
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,439
are reflected when the license term

1657
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,198
starts

1658
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,439
and

1659
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,040
it is not the sales date

1660
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,960
because some

1661
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,759
products

1662
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,120
are deployed for a long time

1663
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,439
it's it may be a long

1664
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,198
project uh

1665
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,000
it may take several months

1666
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,839
and

1667
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:50,560
uh sales may take place this year and

1668
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,640
the license

1669
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,960
and the right to use our product the

1670
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,679
start of the licensing period can start

1671
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,560
with the lag of several months that is

1672
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,080
why we have this uh time gap

1673
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,239
when you see our

1674
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,239
sales it's higher

1675
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:12,159
from five to ten percent of sales uh

1676
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:16,000
moving to the next period and some sales

1677
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,800
are recognized

1678
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,960
gradually

1679
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,440
along the entire

1680
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,440
term

1681
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,520
it was interesting to listen to the

1682
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,800
presentation but as an investor

1683
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,440
i am interested in risks

1684
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,840
the

1685
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,800
growth driver was only one

1686
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,360
government

1687
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,520
sanctions

1688
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,640
against

1689
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,760
unfriendly country trees and regulatory

1690
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,280
and you cannot buy foreign

1691
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,679
cybersec tools but

1692
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,640
i believe in the future i believe that

1693
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,440
the current situation is temporary what

1694
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,080
is happening what is going to happen

1695
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,520
next let's

1696
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,800
imagine that positive will work for

1697
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,400
many years

1698
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,280
and the situation is going to change

1699
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,000
and competition will come back what are

1700
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,400
you going to do then

1701
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,280
and

1702
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,480
the product without competition usually

1703
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,800
becomes weaker

1704
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,120
correct me if i'm wrong

1705
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:42,320
now positive is expensive it costs 29

1706
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,360
a year

1707
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,719
revenues

1708
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,800
the average price for russia is 4.5 and

1709
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,400
imagine that all the sanctions will go

1710
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,960
at once

1711
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,080
what will happen to your company of

1712
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,120
course

1713
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,000
revenues are there

1714
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,360
cybersec

1715
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,440
market is

1716
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,040
has a lot of inertia but what about

1717
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,719
share prices

1718
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,600
it's a good question i

1719
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,640
was thinking about risks

1720
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,840
let me answer your

1721
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,719
questions i see two main risks the first

1722
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,960
one

1723
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,159
budgets of the customers

1724
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,280
budgets

1725
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,640
will be confiscated they will wouldn't

1726
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,800
have the money to spend on cybersec

1727
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,840
and

1728
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,440
this risk can be

1729
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,560
mitigated by

1730
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,960
the

1731
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,320
presidential decree because it

1732
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,400
demonstrates the vector

1733
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,520
we need responsibility we're going to

1734
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,120
invest

1735
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:02,080
and you have to have special roles

1736
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:02,960
and

1737
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,600
one of the rules is about incident

1738
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,280
response

1739
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,199
so i think

1740
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,600
the customers will have budgets and the

1741
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,560
second risk is about hardware

1742
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,640
as you know

1743
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,000
now we have lack of hardware new

1744
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,239
logistical channels are yet to be

1745
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,000
developed

1746
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
our software

1747
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,120
needs

1748
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,719
uh hardware

1749
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:29,840
basis

1750
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,199
on the one hand

1751
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,199
we have some hardware reserves

1752
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,520
and that is true

1753
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,520
we have enough hardware

1754
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,960
for several more months

1755
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:51,520
we want to adapt our products and sell

1756
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,239
our products

1757
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,678
through services

1758
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,400
we have a lot of companies who say we

1759
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,120
want to sell services on the basis of

1760
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,040
your products please

1761
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,920
uh

1762
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,560
we need special licenses we are not

1763
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,960
going to sell licenses we are going to

1764
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,880
sell services then our products may be

1765
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,600
in the cloud and the customer wouldn't

1766
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,199
think about installing new hardware he

1767
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,960
gets service

1768
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,760
from

1769
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,480
the cloud

1770
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,520
through that we're going to mitigate the

1771
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,400
second risk your third question was

1772
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,520
about

1773
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,719
the future what is going to happen if

1774
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,040
the sanctions will go and the

1775
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,480
competition will come back

1776
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,799
yes

1777
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,880
i uh gave three answers to that question

1778
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,679
today in different sections you have a

1779
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,360
family doctor who knows all your

1780
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,600
ailments

1781
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,880
he went away quarreled with you

1782
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,239
and he

1783
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,360
told

1784
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,520
the entire community about your

1785
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,000
illnesses then he comes back and says

1786
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,960
sorry

1787
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,880
my fault

1788
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,600
in cyber security the issue of trust

1789
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,440
is key

1790
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,880
the events

1791
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,040
demonstrated that this risk is not

1792
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,679
hypothetical it's real

1793
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,080
for a commercial company

1794
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,400
for positive technologies for instance

1795
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,400
and i hope for most of you

1796
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,560
the top

1797
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,239
asset is our customers and we are not

1798
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,380
ready to

1799
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,600
[Music]

1800
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,280
sacrifice

1801
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,760
our customers we don't want to play

1802
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,320
geopolitics

1803
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,280
we have some geopolitical wins and you

1804
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,519
go

1805
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,480
and your top value is not in your

1806
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,840
customers and there is one more factor

1807
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,880
why do i not believe in rapid

1808
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,000
return

1809
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,880
of

1810
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,760
the competition

1811
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,760
deployment

1812
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,320
implementation of those technologies it

1813
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,719
takes a lot of effort

1814
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:21,679
then

1815
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,159
it affects

1816
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,280
the systems that are integrated in the

1817
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,560
security

1818
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,120
infrastructure replacement of any

1819
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,400
product

1820
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,840
which is deeply integrated in the system

1821
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,719
is

1822
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,600
very expensive and it takes a lot of

1823
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,920
time

1824
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,120
why

1825
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,719
did we talk about import substitution

1826
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,600
why are we against we said the

1827
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,320
government doesn't understand the cost

1828
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,440
the government doesn't evaluate the risk

1829
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,560
properly if you we can avoid import

1830
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,199
substitution we are not going to

1831
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,719
substitute import and we see that the

1832
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,000
risks were not hypothetical

1833
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,360
and

1834
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,159
we are all running

1835
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,440
now

1836
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,560
without any presidential decrees

1837
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,520
we start replacing and substituting

1838
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,320
imported goods

1839
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,440
within several years we're going to

1840
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,120
substitute

1841
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,239
import

1842
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,440
and it's a long-term story it will take

1843
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,640
decades even if those people and

1844
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,840
companies would like to come back to the

1845
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,480
market of russian federation

1846
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,840
there is an interesting marker here

1847
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,480
an interesting indication

1848
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,320
government

1849
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,280
companies with government capital are

1850
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,400
inert

1851
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,800
commercial companies large commercial

1852
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,400
companies uh move faster

1853
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,360
and the things which happen from the

1854
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,760
moment of the

1855
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,320
withdrawal of the russian

1856
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,880
of the foreign companies commercial

1857
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,360
companies came to us who are not

1858
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:20,640
regulated who are not under licensing

1859
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,199
they just came to us because they know

1860
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,840
that they can earn their money here

1861
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,360
regulatory factor is not the main driver

1862
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,239
i disagree with you it's important that

1863
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,440
is true but the main driver is what is

1864
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,960
happening in the market now i hope i

1865
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,280
answered all your questions

1866
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,679
and there was one more question about

1867
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,199
the your revenue

1868
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,800
share price to revenue ratio

1869
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,000
how

1870
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
are we going to develop without

1871
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,960
competition that we used to have

1872
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,120
yes when we developed our product

1873
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,520
application firewall

1874
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,040
we

1875
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,440
sent it to gartner because we had

1876
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,080
powerful international ambitions we have

1877
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,440
always been competing against palato and

1878
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,640
pegra f5 and others

1879
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,760
it was just

1880
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,040
and now

1881
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,679
that part of competition disappeared

1882
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,199
vanished uh how are we going to develop

1883
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:28,640
on

1884
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,000
the cybersec industry is different from

1885
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,480
many other ones

1886
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,679
you can compare compare fiber whatsapp

1887
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:40,880
and telegram by the number of users

1888
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,719
but

1889
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,120
technological driver

1890
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,360
for our products

1891
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,120
is the capability of product to

1892
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,239
repulse cyber attack

1893
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:57,840
our product kaspersky product we we have

1894
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,040
competition inside the country yes

1895
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,840
if

1896
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,239
in russia

1897
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:07,199
we continue to have such toxic

1898
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,199
environment

1899
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,760
internet attacks attacks against

1900
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,000
refrigerators

1901
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,760
against through

1902
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,960
our

1903
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,159
the demand to our product

1904
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,600
would be

1905
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,920
stimulated by those attacks

1906
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,120
if we have cyber attacks the level of

1907
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,520
the product will be sufficient to

1908
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,320
counteract such attacks

1909
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,360
the multipliers first of all

1910
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,560
evaluation of our capitalization

1911
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,880
share price

1912
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,400
we compared it

1913
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,800
we did it in december last year

1914
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,440
it wasn't uh it isn't much higher now

1915
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,360
the potential of growth is ahead

1916
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:06,159
if we look the forecasts for this year

1917
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,120
2022

1918
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,120
it's not 27

1919
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,480
it's less than 20 17 perhaps

1920
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,040
fifteen look at our forecasts

1921
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,159
the company grew before all kind of

1922
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:25,199
geopolitical events by forty percent a

1923
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,080
year

1924
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,400
we doubled

1925
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,480
in capitalization every two years

1926
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,040
a very high growth rate

1927
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,000
even without

1928
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,560
the leaving of the foreign vendors

1929
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,280
additional

1930
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,760
demand for cyber security the company

1931
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,199
would demonstrate high growth rates even

1932
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,960
if all the competitors stay

1933
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,960
we always competed

1934
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,880
until recently

1935
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,440
up to 60

1936
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,840
of products of any large

1937
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,960
uh

1938
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,400
government owned or private company 60

1939
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,600
of products were foreign and we competed

1940
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,320
with them all the way for 20 years that

1941
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,199
were in the market

1942
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,920
such a

1943
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,120
deep question are there any uh questions

1944
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,639
from the audience or shall i read from

1945
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,239
the chat feed

1946
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,440
yes please

1947
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,600
i have two questions if you allow

1948
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,840
for one short and one a bit longer the

1949
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,560
short question is about the dividend

1950
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,880
i heard that the company is willing to

1951
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,400
pay out dividends

1952
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,920
are there any plans

1953
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,320
regarding uh changing the policy for

1954
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,679
instance

1955
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,800
to pay out of dividends

1956
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,320
every quarter

1957
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,560
as it happened at best practices all

1958
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,639
this would be paid out once a year twice

1959
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,920
a year let me answer

1960
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,639
we are not closing uh this opportunity

1961
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,120
for us it's clear that the dividend

1962
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,440
related to our operating activities

1963
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,400
and

1964
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,199
net

1965
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,480
cash flow

1966
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,919
can be paid once

1967
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,840
yeah but if we see that we are able to

1968
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,719
pay

1969
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,920
them more frequently we'll do that

1970
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,520
[Music]

1971
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,400
this

1972
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,040
is a specificity of not only positive

1973
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,040
but other companies that has a

1974
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,920
diversified customer portfolio stable

1975
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,040
cash flow

1976
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,320
and the specificity is that half of the

1977
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,600
revenues

1978
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,920
we get it in q4

1979
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,320
so roughly speaking to understand how

1980
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,360
we're going to close the fiscal year

1981
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,880
we can only do that in q4 so for me as

1982
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,960
one of the positive top managers

1983
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,239
would seem quite strange to make a

1984
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,040
decision to pay out the dividends

1985
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,280
in the interim points

1986
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,440
before we understand how we're going to

1987
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,679
finish the fiscal year so largely

1988
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,320
speaking we are going to understand it

1989
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,199
in november or december so a more or

1990
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,639
less accurate

1991
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,480
forecast of our financial financial

1992
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,560
result appears at that time so if you

1993
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,199
ask me max when do you

1994
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,520
want to pay out the dividend i said hey

1995
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,840
guys let's wait uh for the moment so

1996
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,360
when we understand the results that

1997
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,520
would be an honest answer from me

1998
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,159
may i add

1999
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,120
just for the balance yes

2000
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,000
as part of our dividend policy

2001
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,440
we focus on this effective balance

2002
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,678
on on the one hand we have good

2003
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,120
profits

2004
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,320
we don't want

2005
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,360
to

2006
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,440
lose momentum

2007
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,360
in our development

2008
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,440
and if our

2009
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,800
debt

2010
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,239
level allows that

2011
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:55,040
if we if it's low if we see a positive

2012
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,480
forecast for the further growth of sales

2013
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,760
so theoretically we would be prepared to

2014
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,880
make a decision a decision uh to pay

2015
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,040
interim dividends it's just like we did

2016
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,199
last year in q4 but max is absolutely

2017
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,120
right the main decision

2018
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,159
will

2019
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:14,880
be

2020
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,199
forming our expectations at the end of

2021
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,480
the year

2022
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,159
so q4 and q1 next year

2023
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,880
yeah nice

2024
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,639
curious

2025
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,719
one company three opinions and then the

2026
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,280
question yeah it's about your desire to

2027
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,280
get in the top league

2028
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,320
of companies if i understand correctly

2029
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,280
and now you have about 18

2030
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,960
or 11.8 or 10.8 percent

2031
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,320
because we

2032
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,120
how to improve it in order to

2033
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,159
get into some indices are going to sell

2034
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,520
some shares by the main shareholders

2035
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,760
let me take this question technically

2036
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,320
the company has only uh two

2037
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,280
ways to improve the freefalls it's

2038
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,000
indeed about secondary sales somebody is

2039
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,719
selling the existing shares or it could

2040
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,600
be a an additional issue

2041
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,960
additional issue is a

2042
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,320
difficult

2043
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,040
topic because it works against the

2044
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,080
existing shareholders and of course we

2045
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,480
do not want to do that

2046
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,719
an additional issuance can is only

2047
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,280
possible if we're growing really fast

2048
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,840
and for a small fraction of this growth

2049
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,000
we can cover it with additional

2050
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,080
uh stock issue

2051
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,320
so the answer is yes if we see that the

2052
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,239
free float is a limitation

2053
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,080
to what can affect

2054
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,239
uh our liquidity for instance it's not

2055
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,480
growing because the free float is not

2056
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,880
large enough so technically we can

2057
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,840
consider

2058
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,159
sbo that's additional sales

2059
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,199
but

2060
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,320
here uh the goal would be to grow the

2061
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,360
frequent faults to assure liquidity in

2062
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,560
the interest of the existing

2063
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,920
shareholders i mean external

2064
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,520
shareholders

2065
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,920
those tens of thousands of people

2066
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,719
because any increase in free float will

2067
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:09,840
affect

2068
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,880
the capitalization and the price of

2069
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,639
shares

2070
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,960
thank you

2071
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,880
let me read out one question from the

2072
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,600
chat feed and now come back again uh to

2073
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,320
the

2074
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,280
uh to the uh to the room uh how strongly

2075
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,480
the company is suffering uh from the new

2076
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,080
round of sanctions so this is the

2077
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,719
question how strongly is

2078
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,120
the company suffering from the new round

2079
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,679
of sanctions for an unexpected question

2080
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,440
so let me take it

2081
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,639
i don't know

2082
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,480
fortunately or unfortunately i don't

2083
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,960
like the word beneficiary yes the

2084
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,480
company is

2085
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,760
really winning from the new

2086
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,719
round of sanctions

2087
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,800
going on

2088
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,639
well why don't i hear the applause

2089
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,960
okay any questions from the floor from

2090
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,960
the room

2091
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,159
no

2092
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,760
just the question about the sanctions

2093
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,000
was from myself i decided to take up the

2094
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,480
microphone i meant the risks for

2095
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,480
instance there's no hardware to sell

2096
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,120
your products to customers or how will

2097
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,800
your internal operations suffer from

2098
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,840
that

2099
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,800
how

2100
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,639
can the company suffer from what's

2101
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,719
happening in the world indirectly

2102
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,239
the question is clear

2103
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:27,040
these risks we as a company has worked

2104
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,560
through in

2105
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,320
uh half

2106
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,719
one of the previous year as if you

2107
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,080
remember

2108
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,480
one of the companies uh belonging to the

2109
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,800
group has come under sanctions at that

2110
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,679
time

2111
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:40,480
we

2112
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,040
ran into all these risks like technology

2113
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,360
limitations access limitations things

2114
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,000
like that so we had to reassemble the

2115
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
technology stack

2116
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,960
to

2117
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,719
execute all our business functions in

2118
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:55,520
the company and uh by the time

2119
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,719
when all other sanctions have arrived we

2120
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:01,120
have already solved this problem more

2121
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,960
than that our iit

2122
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,800
director cio alexander is now

2123
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,280
conducting workshops

2124
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,199
explaining how the i.t service of large

2125
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:17,040
company should act if unexpectedly

2126
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,880
it appears that some services products

2127
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,880
or technologies that used to be

2128
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,880
available in the past to become

2129
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,920
unavailable so we're actually helping

2130
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,600
companies that

2131
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,639
are

2132
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,320
that have encountered themselves in this

2133
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,719
situation for the first time

2134
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,960
uh what about

2135
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,320
the

2136
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,480
regarding the hardware

2137
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,840
uh we

2138
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,760
have uh we

2139
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,360
got you an answer from you but what

2140
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,199
about uh

2141
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,320
knowledge

2142
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,159
intelligence sharing

2143
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,400
any problems yes there are problems let

2144
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,880
me give you an answer there are two

2145
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,760
uh

2146
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,480
areas one that hasn't been mentioned is

2147
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,679
uh about uh talent and people aren't we

2148
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,920
losing other people now now our

2149
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,440
statistic is such

2150
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,360
that

2151
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,480
after the 24th of february

2152
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,440
of 1200 employees we got 35 people

2153
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,678
uh

2154
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,520
that went on uh remote very remote work

2155
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,760
of which of you

2156
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,480
left the company

2157
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:26,800
[Music]

2158
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,600
also we are talking with teams of such

2159
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,560
companies as amd intro palo alto

2160
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,400
what max has mentioned in his

2161
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,679
presentation and we see a lot of people

2162
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,920
a lot of super talented professionals

2163
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,000
and managers

2164
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,560
uh from mid-level to top

2165
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,800
who in other circumstances would not

2166
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,639
have been looking for work uh we

2167
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,080
wouldn't have been able to get again

2168
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,520
access to them

2169
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,960
but now for the reason uh that uh the

2170
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,639
main company has left russia and they

2171
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,480
can't leave the country because of

2172
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,440
family reasons uh they are not able to

2173
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,560
join us

2174
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,280
and the second part is the one affecting

2175
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,880
the entire industry and civilization i

2176
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,840
would put it this way we've got

2177
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,840
the process of data sharing about

2178
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,320
vulnerabilities in the industry so how

2179
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,880
did it look in the past the positive

2180
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,679
technology has a lot of hackers involved

2181
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,199
and i myself was one so we find a

2182
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,199
vulnerability let's say in an intel

2183
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,199
solution we send information to intel

2184
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,520
intel fixes it says thank you

2185
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,719
and

2186
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,639
passes shares this information with all

2187
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,000
the monitoring

2188
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,920
services and everybody

2189
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,639
uh get all customers get

2190
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,520
some listing everybody's happy uh the

2191
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,880
vulnerability has been fixed now the

2192
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,360
situation looks like this uh we are

2193
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,760
sending a vulnerability

2194
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,760
but uh from the other side uh

2195
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,239
the uh i mean the russian companies uh

2196
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:59,360
this update it doesn't arrive there

2197
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,239
so this sanctioned question uh is there

2198
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,840
and a simple answer as to how to

2199
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,639
restructure this process uh because

2200
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:09,840
what's happening is an absolute

2201
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:14,639
evil so everybody is suffering

2202
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,639
including the vendors i think i am

2203
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,560
hoping that

2204
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,040
some mechanism will be found

2205
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,800
so as to

2206
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,880
continue this dialogue

2207
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,520
in some way

2208
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,960
thank you thank you

2209
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,239
anybody else

2210
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,239
from the room

2211
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,400
one comment and one question

2212
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,440
the comment is about the capitalization

2213
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,560
of the company

2214
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,560
uh you said that the pe ratio is uh 29

2215
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,520
and that has

2216
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,960
on on the other hand the company is

2217
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,520
growing uh very fast how to bring this

2218
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,480
together there's a simple

2219
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,600
ratio pe uh over g

2220
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,239
in this case is 0.3 and the company is

2221
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,719
considered to be expensive if it's more

2222
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,239
than unity more than one so i think that

2223
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:07,600
there's an x3 a gap to a fair value

2224
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,120
thank you

2225
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,199
and my question is

2226
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,679
as far as i remember

2227
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,679
out of my memory and the number of large

2228
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:18,000
enterprises as a percentage of total

2229
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,760
number of companies

2230
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,800
80 90 percent

2231
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,040
and at the same time

2232
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,440
you are growing you're planning to have

2233
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,080
an x2 x3 growth

2234
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,679
uh how to find

2235
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:36,320
the number of enterprises that would

2236
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,400
sustain this growth just

2237
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:44,080
so either you're going to

2238
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,480
grow the price of your products or going

2239
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,560
to other markets i haven't quite got

2240
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,320
well i haven't mentioned all the growth

2241
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,880
drivers for the company

2242
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,320
the number of sold customers

2243
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,679
uh that you called large enterprises

2244
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:00,560
uh

2245
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,120
which indeed our target segment

2246
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,320
of course their number is limited

2247
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,159
if you take any ranking

2248
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,880
for capitalization for instance uh

2249
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,080
like ra 500 you'll see that 90 percent

2250
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,280
of this

2251
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,320
list are already positive customers last

2252
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,080
year we had 80

2253
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,560
then 85. now it's 90.

2254
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,159
so there's no

2255
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,400
more room to grow

2256
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,920
in terms of the number of customers

2257
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,000
they're already our customers so the

2258
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,679
answer to your question

2259
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,120
is like this we have new products

2260
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:35,840
we

2261
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,320
are expanding

2262
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,920
the number of products

2263
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,440
that we sell

2264
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,119
to each customer that's one thing second

2265
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,560
we are

2266
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,960
extending expanding the installation

2267
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,119
base of

2268
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:53,760
each product within this customer

2269
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,000
so for instance

2270
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,560
the customer has 10 000 nodes

2271
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,280
we've uh sold them maxpad and cm for

2272
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,520
5000 nodes and we have a growth

2273
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,280
potential of

2274
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,800
another 5

2275
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,239
000 uh nodes within this company this

2276
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,639
this customer that's in our answer

2277
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,480
number two for this growth

2278
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,719
answer number three

2279
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,880
technologies

2280
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,800
of uh the positive meta product level o2

2281
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,280
are products of a different level

2282
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,199
these are the products

2283
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,560
that

2284
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,280
we don't see in the world market now

2285
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,000
and if you talk about business these are

2286
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,040
products of a different price category

2287
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,760
so positive is not only playing in the

2288
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,119
product segments

2289
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:44,320
of the iot security market but we are

2290
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,280
also expanding this market

2291
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,400
in itself

2292
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,480
through the emergence of new ideas

2293
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,560
products and technologies it's due to

2294
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,000
this that

2295
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,920
we are going

2296
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,080
to

2297
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:58,960
be

2298
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,600
to have the growth potential for the

2299
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,520
next five years at least

2300
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,840
and coming back to my thought our

2301
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,520
international ambition

2302
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,440
we're not losing them

2303
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,440
in any event

2304
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,480
we

2305
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,360
are

2306
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,719
matching them

2307
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,560
with reality

2308
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,639
and we believe that the products that

2309
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,800
have been uh developed and have been

2310
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
used in the country

2311
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,800
during this period of a high number of

2312
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:25,760
attacks

2313
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,880
uh has also uh become uh a competitive

2314
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,719
advantage for us

2315
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,960
it's clear that we're not going to uh

2316
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,199
work in all markets but at least for

2317
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,520
those uh that to work with russia

2318
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,520
on the level of

2319
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,320
rumors i heard a theory why

2320
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,840
turkey uh

2321
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,320
buying s-400

2322
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,360
because

2323
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,840
when they got those f-35s

2324
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,360
the uh u.s maids

2325
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,600
system did not work uh did not start to

2326
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,000
uh shoot at them either there was no

2327
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,520
technical capability or they were

2328
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,480
blocked so we basically see

2329
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,360
uh a demand for this cyber sovereignty

2330
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,880
so called digital independence

2331
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:11,760
that

2332
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,679
we have made the key topic of this forum

2333
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:16,960
and this

2334
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,239
uh in our

2335
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:21,920
uh opinion uh defines a huge potential

2336
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,719
export potential of russian technologies

2337
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,400
and it's not even my own opinion it's an

2338
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,639
uh expert community opinion worldwide

2339
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,400
there are three countries that are

2340
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,960
capable of

2341
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,320
solving

2342
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,639
information security problems

2343
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:41,600
in full stack

2344
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,520
effectively and efficiently

2345
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,560
the us

2346
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,440
israel and russia

2347
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:52,159
the potential demands for digital

2348
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:55,199
sovereignty is very high

2349
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:59,119
so whether we are able to implement this

2350
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,360
this is a challenge this is what drives

2351
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,600
us let's wait and see

2352
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,400
a brief question from the chat

2353
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,000
uh what's

2354
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,040
the

2355
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,719
probability of your shares getting into

2356
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,080
some index

2357
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:16,159
the answer it is high

2358
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:17,520
stay tuned

2359
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,600
and i think next month or two

2360
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,040
you'll learn

2361
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,560
which indices

2362
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,520
uh positive has become part of

2363
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,760
any questions from the floor

2364
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,080
yes i have the questions uh they're more

2365
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:34,080
technology related it's about

2366
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,760
the

2367
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,760
goal of making it

2368
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,119
making inadmissible impossible

2369
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,400
and

2370
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,360
again you were saying that to a thousand

2371
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,679
hackers you want to replace them uh with

2372
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,199
a piece of software

2373
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:50,000
that

2374
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,560
is going to check if the system is

2375
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,679
breakable is it uh possible to uh

2376
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,239
theoretically uh to

2377
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,400
check that the system is unbreakable

2378
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,000
it's a good question i think we already

2379
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,080
gave an answer but i repeat

2380
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,000
quite often they tell us it's a good

2381
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,679
goal

2382
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,080
i'm sorry

2383
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,119
yeah the answer is just one

2384
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,360
uh these this can be only achieved

2385
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,400
through cyber exercises and you won't be

2386
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,400
able to check

2387
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,480
the protectedness like for instance

2388
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,080
positive has built a system for you

2389
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,800
and you define those invisible event and

2390
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,880
then you say go and

2391
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,000
show me on the infrastructure that

2392
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,280
it's impossible to break these

2393
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,440
so you're not happy with positive call

2394
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,760
kaspersky call by zone

2395
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,320
and check

2396
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,080
he

2397
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,159
didn't manage to do it once so they

2398
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,920
didn't manage to do it twice or three

2399
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,199
times that's good

2400
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:52,840
the

2401
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:57,440
standoff uh operates 365

2402
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,159
days a year you can take part of your

2403
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:02,480
infrastructure there so the hackers

2404
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,600
could

2405
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,280
test it non-stop

2406
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,199
for vulnerabilities

2407
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:08,480
only practice

2408
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:12,880
can verify the impossibility of a result

2409
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,199
that's why we call this story practical

2410
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:16,960
uh security because

2411
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,280
not a certificate from the regulator

2412
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,280
that everything is protected it doesn't

2413
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,159
work this way in real life

2414
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,960
it has to be tested

2415
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,320
told us today that we

2416
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,840
have launched or maybe our launch

2417
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,440
tomorrow we're launching the bug bounty

2418
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,360
platform so is the bug bounce is when

2419
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,960
you say dear world

2420
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,920
if

2421
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:40,800
you

2422
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,080
are able

2423
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,320
to

2424
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:47,360
fix our source code and it will get to

2425
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,040
the first customer we're going to pay

2426
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,560
you a million dollars

2427
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,639
we've tested

2428
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:54,560
then we got that million or didn't and

2429
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,600
now we're going to pay 10 000 or 100 000

2430
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,119
so this is

2431
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,440
the development of this idea of

2432
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,840
cyber

2433
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,440
exercises in crowdsourcing uh with

2434
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:08,560
growing uh remuneration for the result

2435
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,320
okay i got it thank you so the

2436
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,400
probability is not 100

2437
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,480
but in practical terms if you if you've

2438
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,800
passed through uh cyber

2439
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,920
exercises it's a

2440
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,199
proof that's very hard to break

2441
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:23,920
so

2442
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,159
let's

2443
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,280
we have this idea

2444
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,080
that

2445
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,480
the first level of preparedness for

2446
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,440
attacks

2447
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,040
is

2448
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:38,320
through conducting cyber

2449
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,199
cyber exercises

2450
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,320
attracting

2451
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,800
some professional

2452
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,880
white hacker organization

2453
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,760
then so it's only through experience

2454
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,199
and i wouldn't like to operate with

2455
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:54,080
probability okay my second question is

2456
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,119
about this

2457
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:56,080
if

2458
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,560
we have expensive equipment

2459
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,960
that saves us from some specific

2460
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,199
problems does it make sense to create

2461
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:05,040
products that are going to be cheaper

2462
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,239
for instance

2463
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,040
we are not installing some chip

2464
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,400
but we protect against let's say 90 of

2465
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,440
hazards

2466
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,520
does it make sense to offer such

2467
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,320
products do you do anything like this

2468
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,480
well i haven't quite uh let me take this

2469
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,520
question

2470
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,920
i think i got the question

2471
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,159
look at the concepts uh of information

2472
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,639
security 2.0 meta products

2473
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,840
is not about percentage at all so

2474
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,119
assessing the success

2475
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,639
in percentage terms is exactly the blind

2476
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:42,239
alley the industry has been operating in

2477
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,600
in all these past years so our idea is

2478
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,080
to make it so uh that

2479
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,400
those unlimited that limited number of

2480
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,239
inadmissible events should become

2481
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,960
impossible so for a specific specific or

2482
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,600
specific company and all these security

2483
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,000
tools all the technology stack and

2484
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,280
solutions

2485
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,159
uh will be focused uh on not allowing

2486
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,760
these events to happen

2487
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,719
uh if anybody is going to

2488
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,040
change the landing page on the website

2489
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,960
for some business it's not a problem but

2490
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,639
for some it is a problem

2491
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:16,960
and it's this that we're talking about

2492
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,080
so that these inadmissible uh events

2493
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,840
should not happen and the whole system

2494
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,440
should be focused on that and all these

2495
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,520
external tests that we've been

2496
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,800
mentioning

2497
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,040
through

2498
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:30,560
attracting uh

2499
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,360
external hackers to test it they should

2500
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,760
all be formulated in this context i

2501
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,360
think i've got the question

2502
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,199
that is i helped you to formulate the

2503
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,960
question once again right

2504
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,800
uh you were not answering the question

2505
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,360
that they asked

2506
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,599
look

2507
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,239
how i understood the question you said

2508
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:55,040
if there's a goal

2509
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,600
and so you have expensive technologies

2510
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,159
that allow you uh to achieve that uh

2511
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:01,600
does it make sense to buy some niche

2512
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,320
products is it this that you took

2513
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,679
to provide uh for uh protection that

2514
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:12,560
would not assure you 100 uh but do it 90

2515
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,840
i got the question correctly

2516
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,639
that's what i always tell to

2517
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,840
say to positive salespeople see the

2518
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,840
topic of information security 2.0

2519
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,360
to set the goal as to make the

2520
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,320
admissible uh events impossible this is

2521
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,080
the thermonuclear theme because if

2522
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,119
you've sold this gold to the customer i

2523
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:37,679
say so in the good sense of the word be

2524
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,840
prepared to them

2525
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,880
throwing out all the previous budgets

2526
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,880
for information security

2527
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,800
they'll say if it's my goal

2528
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,199
to make admissible events impossible why

2529
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,960
am i buying these systems that are not

2530
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,320
leading me to this goal so let me stop

2531
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,199
all

2532
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:58,080
these purchases that i've been doing

2533
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,560
before and let me

2534
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,719
use the budget to achieve this goal and

2535
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,880
we actually find this situation quite

2536
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,280
often i mean positive sales people we

2537
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,040
are for business and i'm also for

2538
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,960
business even though i'm mostly a false

2539
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,239
sense in meaning

2540
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,600
so i always say hey uh think a hundred

2541
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,400
times uh before you do it uh if you want

2542
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,719
to achieve this meaning you have to do

2543
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,400
it in a thorough way

2544
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,880
in a non-disruptive way so the customs

2545
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,679
customers also arrive there there's also

2546
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,760
a bottom-up approach where which is

2547
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,080
uh used by one of our competitors

2548
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,159
they're using the word cyber immunity

2549
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,239
like for instance you have to brush your

2550
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,560
teeth into walking wash your hands

2551
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,239
it'll make your life better will it make

2552
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:45,760
my life better it will for sure but will

2553
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,119
it leave

2554
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:50,159
the door open or for bad things it will

2555
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,960
it's up to uh every one of you to choose

2556
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,719
the way you're going to go

2557
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,239
if you say we're going to install these

2558
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:58,000
systems and it will improve our life

2559
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,920
then frankly you're answering you you'll

2560
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,840
be answering questions that inadmissible

2561
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,400
the questions will still be

2562
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,639
possible in your situation the hacker

2563
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:09,199
once setting a goal will be able to get

2564
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:11,520
into your system and do whatever you

2565
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,280
don't like the most

2566
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,880
yes you'll get protected from school

2567
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,360
children but you're not going to get

2568
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:21,759
protected from a targeted attack

2569
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,040
and actually

2570
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,040
you shouldn't forget that our target

2571
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,760
segment is large b2bs large enterprises

2572
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,480
other risks

2573
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,280
so for instance there are some risks

2574
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,080
that any serious organization uh can

2575
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,880
admit like for instance a power plant

2576
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,320
will not allow a

2577
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,719
catastrophe happen

2578
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:47,199
so for non-critical companies what you

2579
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,119
said could be a strategy but our

2580
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,960
strategy is just like we've described

2581
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,800
because of our specificity yeah thank

2582
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,600
you okay i suggest to take one more one

2583
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,639
or two questions more from the room and

2584
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,159
okay you've already asked

2585
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,800
me so uh most

2586
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,280
products run either on a windows

2587
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,760
operating system open source debian

2588
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,400
after cm for instance do you plan

2589
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,520
to set some other trend

2590
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,159
well we're now migrating to linux

2591
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,040
look

2592
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,400
i think

2593
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,800
so what's the technology question yes

2594
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,080
indeed

2595
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,920
our products we have products that have

2596
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,239
been migrated to linux everything that

2597
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,639
could be migrated has been as to the

2598
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:32,800
russian operating system i would like

2599
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,040
this trend to kind of

2600
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,600
develop because we have products working

2601
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,159
on astro linux uh that's used in russia

2602
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,080
quite a lot in government organizations

2603
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,119
and of course

2604
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:46,800
we keep supporting that but if we see

2605
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,360
uh have a get a clearer vision of a new

2606
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,480
platform

2607
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,400
that is going to become prevalent in

2608
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:55,040
russia we're going to support it as well

2609
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,560
another question you had a question

2610
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,800
right

2611
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,040
no no i can't hear you

2612
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,360
yes one more question

2613
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,480
look

2614
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,960
i haven't seen in your presentation

2615
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,920
among the numbers that you showed uh you

2616
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,639
named the total address of a market size

2617
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,920
270 billion rubles does the company has

2618
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,159
a goal to

2619
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:23,679
control some market share specific 10 or

2620
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:26,960
20 percent or 30 percent of the market

2621
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,119
the top

2622
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,360
goal is there

2623
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,280
and it even projects it down to

2624
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,800
uh positive

2625
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,480
one board sales plan uh the sales plan

2626
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,000
is larger than the plan of the

2627
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
department uh the sum of department

2628
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,440
plans is larger than the company plans

2629
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,280
we set the target

2630
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,360
at the sales level at 50 percent of the

2631
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,400
budget of our customers we say

2632
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,480
of what the customer is spending on

2633
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,119
information security positive with our

2634
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,119
products online should collect more than

2635
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,080
half

2636
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,560
and if we're talking about a strategy at

2637
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,400
the level of the total russian market

2638
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,040
our midterm strategy not for this year

2639
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,679
or maybe three years down the road is a

2640
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:14,800
30 percent of the russian market

2641
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,920
i must say

2642
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,880
that

2643
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,239
uh there are a number of segments

2644
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:19,520
technology segments in the russian

2645
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,840
market for which positive doesn't have

2646
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,239
products and who doesn't even have plans

2647
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,560
to get self products and these are

2648
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,080
quite large segments for instance the

2649
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,840
largest one it's a crypto gateways uh

2650
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:35,679
positive does not intend uh to do crypto

2651
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,400
uh gateways uh it's a traditional

2652
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,639
segment it's well regulated and so on so

2653
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:42,400
forth positive

2654
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,719
builds products for the result we have

2655
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:46,080
set the results

2656
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,440
of do an autopilot in cyber security we

2657
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,760
see our technology missing for this to

2658
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,199
happen and we're going to develop these

2659
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:56,199
technologies

2660
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:58,800
okay

2661
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,040
thank you with this

2662
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,119

recession

2668
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,560
for

2669
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,280
cyber security in positive

2670
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,960
