1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
we are now in the area which is the is

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,199
going to see the most intensive battle

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,199
of the day i'm standing close to

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,760
standoff and vladimir nazarov is

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,039
standing next to me in his turn he is my

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
uh traditional co-host and together with

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,000
him we are going to walk you around our

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
state we are going to explain what new

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
stuff we've got uh

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
what are the old things that we continue

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
to work with and which industry should

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,320
be attacked from which locations so that

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,520
something

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
uh something can be disrupted

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,239
unexpectedly are we going to give people

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,280
hints by all means so vladimir um news

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
we aren't talking about

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,320
the industries we

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,840
aren't we're talking about cities

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,680
instead we're talking about states yes

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,519
because we've got industries and there

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,360
are into industry connections

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,200
and if something happens

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
to one industry and we've got three

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,840
industries right

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,680
yes exactly three industries over here

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
you see the oil industry

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,840
those three

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
cells the first ones and then um

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
across

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
the

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
across this this uh place we've got the

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
energy industry where you have the way

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
you see windmills rotating

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
uh over there we've got generation and

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,960
right in the center where you see uh two

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
residential buildings and here on the

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,799
side of the wind farm we've got

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
consumers and

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
energy sales

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
and that part

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,079
is the

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
steel and mining industry and we have

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
everything there we've got

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
mining and we've got

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
upstream there as well we've got uh

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
still meals

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
rolling meals

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
what about segments or segments the

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,959
segments you write these segments

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
so we've got those people who do

52
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
logistics uh they are called hail

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,520
logistics they're responsible for

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,160
transportation railroads traffic light

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,599
management

56
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,080
airlines as well yes airports they they

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
also have the airport under their

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,239
control so these are our segments

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
where do we start

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
okay we can start from where we uh

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
finished yesterday this is oil this is

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,760
our oil storage facility this yellow

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
sink the beautiful yellow tank and

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
closer to us

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
in the forefront

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
behind those trees

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,080
you can see tanks with various

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
firefighting

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
reagents and in the tank itself you can

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
see a

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
round ring

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,840
a circle this is a special system of a

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
fire extinguishing it uses foam

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,360
for those of you who weren't here

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
yesterday and uh you want to

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
understand what's happening

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
uh yesterday we

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
[Music]

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,920
studied

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
oil extraction and also

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
and also

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
loading and unloading yes and storage

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
and storage exactly these are the

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
vessels where oil is stored yes and

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
valerie and i we managed even to

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,959
organize a quick collapse here we

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,920
organized an overspill of oil products

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,239
and yesterday we also promised that

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,920
today

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
well since we already had nova spill

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
last year yes exactly but this time we

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
have the second controller the

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,760
anti-emergency control and the same risk

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,560
cannot be executed again so we kind of

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
made it more challenging exactly but you

96
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,799
also promised that today

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
that we would be witnessing a new event

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
that we never had before

99
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
fire extinguisher exactly exactly yeah

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
i'm trying to lead us exactly to that

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
system let's get closer and let's take a

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
look from over here this is the part

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
that i've already discussed this is the

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
system of phone fire extinguish

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,239
extinguishing inside the sink there is

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,160
this uh ring these are foam generators

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
that are connected with a pipe and if

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
there is a fire when the whole tank is

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,560
on fire and there is flame and black

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
smoke around the phone within 20 seconds

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,919
can be injected and the whole

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,360
tank can be

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,600
filled with foam to

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
cut off oxygen supply so that the fire

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,000
can be extinguished

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
are we going to do this yes yes just

117
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
look look look what's what's happening

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
look the phone

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
there was no fire

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
there was no fire there was a false

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
alarm the system of phone fire

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
extinguishing was activated

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,080
i can see that half of the reservoir is

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
filled with foam what does that mean

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,160
well it means that the product in the

126
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
sink is now

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,919
uh is now contaminated and it needs to

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
be

129
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
evacuated it needs to be

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
cleansed and we are talking about tons

131
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
tons of oil product if you do the same

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
everywhere in all of this you know

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
tank farm i mean you are disrupting

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
logistics in the oil industry the whole

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
supply chain will be disrupted and in

136
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,039
the region this might lead to a collapse

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,800
due to a shortage of uh fuel do you

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,199
think that our attackers will be able to

139
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
do that

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
quite possibly yesterday i met guys

141
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,240
from the team sitting over there

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,800
at the end of the day and they said well

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
we stopped

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
at this at this line at this segment and

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
probably after lunch break we are going

146
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
to witness something quite interesting

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
exactly in the next few hours let's take

148
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,440
a look look at what's happening here

149
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
here and there at least three or two

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
segments no the other two

151
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
cells should also be washed closely the

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
energy is climbing the energy supply oh

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
wow what is going to happen uh i mean

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
which band is going to happen first here

155
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
or there i don't know

156
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,919
i don't know

157
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,000
the attackers the attackers you are

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
watching us right and you can hear us

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
right so

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,440
i want a phone party

161
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,720
at this oil product facility what about

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,160
you

163
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
well i actually like this column it's

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
not a column it's a furnace it's a

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,080
furnace that

166
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
heats up the oil and

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,280
the special effects there are absolutely

168
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
impressive there will be a lot of black

169
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,919
smoke

170
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
do you want we've got three minutes can

171
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
we can we

172
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
can we um

173
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,960
uh give people a demo

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,039
no okay let's let's save it for tomorrow

175
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
all right okay okay okay they're not

176
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
that much time and over here we've got

177
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,479
a bumps and valves that load and unload

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
uh oil and oil products the pumps

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
are pumping the oil into the uh

180
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,560
pipelines

181
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
actually

182
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
i've got a scatter system here this is

183
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
the pump station

184
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,319
the pressure is

185
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,479
really high

186
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
one of the important systems here is a

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
system that balances out the pressure

188
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
the pumping uh pressure

189
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
you need you need to uh

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
you need to appreciate the pressure from

191
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,199
destroying the pipeline

192
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
so here is the system that balances the

193
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
pumping pressure and the hacker's task

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,000
is to

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
deactivate it

196
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
all hackers need to do is

197
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
get access

198
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
to here

199
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
and

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,120
close off

201
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,160
hydroshock and it can actually break

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
down the pipes so let's see what happens

203
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,279
let's shut off

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,200
the valve let's shut off

205
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
the oil product pipeline and i expect

206
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,200
that to be a leakage as village are we

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
going to see a fountain yeah a small

208
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,720
fountain over here

209
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
a small fountain because

210
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,920
of a broken pipe one two three

211
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
no i didn't hit the button

212
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
it's coming it's not coming it's not

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,519
where is it oh there oh

214
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,920
a spillage it wasn't a fountain

215
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
it was a jelly kind of thing well we

216
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,080
tried to imitate oil here to the best of

217
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
our ability

218
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,120
my guys they did it and they're going to

219
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,050
clean it up as well

220
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,000
[Music]

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
so

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
basically

223
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
it looks like something bad happened

224
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
doesn't it

225
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,800
you see

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
the valve was shut off the pump station

227
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,440
is no longer in operation

228
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
so people can actually see that

229
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
something bad happened they will be able

230
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,839
to see

231
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,959
that okay guys

232
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
we expect to see at least another

233
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,959
spillage today well not one not one more

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,279
i don't like this texture really so

235
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
if you are close to this place

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,399
don't get too close to this nasty

237
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,360
uh oil leak

238
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
it's dangerous it looks dangerous okay

239
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,880
thank you very much we will be coming

240
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
back to you again

241
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
and we will walk around uh

242
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,760
we will walk around this location once

243
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,000
more and let's now turn to our guests to

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
our guest speakers
