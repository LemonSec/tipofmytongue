[Music]

3
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
before i will ask an important question

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,200
to which everybody knows about the

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,120
decree of the president from the 1st of

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
may of this year i would like to ask you

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,760
generally

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
what happens right now this is something

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
that we call from the paper to real

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
security transition

11
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
at the

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
state regulated system this is something

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
that state controls directly the second

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
one is personal data

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
if

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,159
um

17
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,079
requires uh involvement of fsb employees

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,600
to react to this and the main objective

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
was to provide practical protection

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
however as usually the owners of the

21
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,079
system they try to go with small blood

22
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,479
okay let's write on the paper put the

23
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
appoint the responsible ones and this

24
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
was the end right sign and this is what

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
was happening in recent years it was an

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,920
attempt of bringing this company

27
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,279
[Music]

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
in the future it might help to the

29
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,239
development of informational security

30
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,239
well there are two layers firstly is

31
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,760
that we see everybody law and law drafts

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
and the most interesting thing

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
that expects us

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,599
this is something that you could hear

35
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
from the ministry of digital is a

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
reverse penalties for personal data

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
leakages so what happens with personal

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,160
data leakages roughly speaking

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
nobody will suffer from it yes those

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,959
people whose data was leaked for them

41
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,560
it's critical of course

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
so

43
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
and for him it's economically unfeasible

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,159
yes of course you can penalize them but

45
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,000
it's not going to work but when in the

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
hdpr gtpr uh european they have

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,400
introduced reversed uh penalties one you

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
can lose a four percent of annual gdp

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
this is economical stimulus to invest

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
into the defense so this doesn't work

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,239
exactly and everybody started defending

52
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,480
themselves but some of that uh that's

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
one that was

54
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,720
another direction and they have

55
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
understood that they need to count money

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,080
and they need to spend money under the

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,599
security and this is going to be

58
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,239
transferred to uh realities as well but

59
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,680
the most interesting thing happens on

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
the level below but this is a legal

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
framework of federal authorities and

62
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
these are decrees which are produced by

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,799
different levels of organizations fsb

64
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,519
and

65
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
this activity is not seen by the public

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
it happens in the background and

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,159
it tackles only those people who are

68
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,879
facing it for example last year

69
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
they have adopted methodology of

70
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
modeling the threats and right now stack

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
makes state informational systems and

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
the critical informational

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
infrastructure to model capable

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,720
activities of hackers and this is what

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,239
happens on your stand to model them in

76
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
advance how we are going to be broken

77
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,159
how we are going to defend ourselves

78
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,799
from this and they require to

79
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
work on plans of reaction what will you

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,879
do

81
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
for example

82
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,880
creating your defense

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
and right now many companies are

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
resisting those who want to stay within

85
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
papers but earlier later they will have

86
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
to move to real security okay let's

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
speak about this degree of president as

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
of 1st of may what it speaks about and

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
most importantly what's going to be the

90
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
consequence of all of this well the

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,880
decree 21st

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
and it was not planned no it was not

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
planned

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,160
and what was provided by the decree

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
already exists in the federal

96
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
legislation for example federal

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
legislation the same laws of the search

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,479
activities

99
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,600
other stimulus laws they

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,560
penalize information system owners and

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
make them to help fsb agents when they

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
do their work and when officers are

103
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
coming

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
when the employees of a national

105
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
coordination center on the computer

106
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
crime uh coming to you come to some

107
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,240
state company and say well from your

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
service there is a mass attack uh in

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,919
some direction we say well everything's

110
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,680
okay let's say okay can you give us

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,039
access to the system and we're going to

112
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,720
show you that it's like that no we're

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
not going to give you the access and

114
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
this process takes a lot of time but

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
right now decree says okay you have to

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
give the access period no argument

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
and before accepting this degree ceo of

118
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
any company did have a right to upon his

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
day

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
degree of the president makes him to use

121
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,479
this right and nothing new is introduced

122
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,720
but right now these

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
set of actions has been legalized the

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
principal newton's prohibition for the

125
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,840
use of means

126
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
of defense of foreign manufacturer this

127
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,319
measure was prepared long time ago there

128
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
was another degree that was prepared

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
with this similar regulation it was

130
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,440
discussed more than a year and the fact

131
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,199
that it was accepted it's an emergency

132
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,880
measure because we found ourselves in

133
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,960
this economical situation when the

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,319
certain means of protection are being

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
blocked and how will it influence this

136
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,600
new law

137
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
and changes in the industry well of

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
course well not just in the industry

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
but in all industries because it's

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
related to everybody yes very often

141
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,240
you see

142
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,960
any human society can be divided into

143
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
three parts there are people like

144
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
pioneers they are using the law because

145
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
they see expediency for themselves they

146
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
have to protect themselves not because

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
the law requires but because we have

148
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
losses and cure losses but there are

149
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,520
those people who ignore the law yes of

150
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,039
course you have to protect yourself but

151
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
it's big expenses and losses from

152
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
attacks are very small and there's a

153
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
very big cluster intermediate cluster

154
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,199
which well they didn't hear about this

155
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,560
law maybe they didn't think about this

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
law and this decree will reduce this

157
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,199
wide path there will be more people who

158
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
will defend themselves there will be

159
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
more people who will cognitively after

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
evaluating their risks will ignore the

161
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,710
law and there will be

162
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,680
[Music]

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,199
and less those who ignore the law they

164
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
perfectly understand which measures can

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
be applied to them whether risking etc

166
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,720
well understanding is the awareness is

167
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
the most important thing which have to

168
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,680
be available in the uh cyber security of

169
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,000
which law drafts are missing right now

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
on the side of our legislators with the

171
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,919
consideration of the new decree well

172
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,520
speaking about the legislation uh

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,639
perhaps

174
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
on the level of the federal law uh

175
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
everything is available the only missing

176
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
is technical regulation documents for

177
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
example in the decree there's a

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
requirement to conduct analysis of the

179
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
defense of the informational systems

180
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
we understand that this is testing for

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
penetration and we are specialists in

182
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
this area who know this area we know

183
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
what has to be included in the pen test

184
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
but this is our internal knowledge it's

185
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,639
not the norm of the regulation

186
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
some state authority comes to you to the

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
licensee who has two graduates of the

188
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
university and they scan the durability

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,199
and they say we will scan you it's going

190
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,199
to be a vulnerability analysis and there

191
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
are no regulation there are no

192
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
regulating documents which would say hey

193
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
guys

194
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,520
you have to follow these steps

195
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,199
definitely

196
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,280
so there is a fact but there is no

197
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,240
specifics no specific not sufficient

198
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
regulation well you can do whatever you

199
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,610
want and you can call it execution

200
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,769
[Music]

201
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,799
as an example

202
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,958
the state standards and conducting

203
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,958
analysis

204
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
dynamic analysis of the secure code and

205
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,279
abstract is not such some serious uh

206
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
language of the security guys but they

207
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,760
specify how the initial code should be

208
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
analyzed for back doors and holes etc

209
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
also they are developing steam similar

210
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
technical regulation documents on how to

211
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
react analyze security events and all

212
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
important things which are needed in

213
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
order to discover these attacks before

214
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
they come to a large-scale problem

215
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
can you tell us about some specific laws

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
which have pushed and influenced on the

217
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
industry of informational security in

218
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,000
the recent three to five years honestly

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,760
speaking every law when it was adopted

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,320
when it is adopted gives a certain push

221
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
to the security industry for example the

222
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,839
person data law has been adopted and the

223
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,519
market immediately moved in this

224
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,120
direction well nobody understands how

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
it's going to be punished nobody

226
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
understands how it's going to be done

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,160
but those people the left part of the

228
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
wing they started thinking about

229
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,200
what

230
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
well we have to invest into the security

231
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,920
and there's a lot of projects to create

232
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
uh systems of information security

233
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
protection personal data protection and

234
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
then the law was uh

235
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
enforced and they see that penalties are

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,519
not so bad and everybody started

237
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
avoiding there's a federal law about

238
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
safety of critical informational

239
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
infrastructure they introduced criminal

240
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,959
code article and then they start saying

241
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
well somebody can go to the prison if

242
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
the industrial company will stop

243
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,279
operation etc and it gave a push

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
and there was a legal experience and

245
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
they say well they can go to the prison

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
if they've done pen tests and suddenly

247
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
they've touched somebody else's system

248
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,200
and

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
this instruction has not been followed

250
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
for example and by the way the law does

251
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,839
not given

252
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
enforcement

253
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,079
of punishment so somebody should stand

254
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,959
there with a stick

255
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
unfortunately

256
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,959
it's to say that it doesn't work any

257
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,640
other direction but the most important

258
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,839
step in a positive direction

259
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
we've been working on this for the

260
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,000
healthcare and right now it's covering

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
other industry

262
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,560
protection from the attack of different

263
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
ships and people can suffer for example

264
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
one person can suffer and people you

265
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,519
know

266
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
be sick at the same time the hospital

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
cannot protect itself

268
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
they will not have security people

269
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
necessary for preventing hacker attacks

270
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
but on the other side they have to be

271
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
protected so in the framework of the

272
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
industry they create the competency

273
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
center industrial center

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,839
which

275
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,160
is a mediator between

276
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,640
and it helps hospitals to attract their

277
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,160
own specialists to solve some precise uh

278
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
problems and objectives yes

279
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
it's i'm speaking about it in the future

280
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,800
tense but it gives certain

281
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
recommendations it helps them to design

282
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
defense systems and basically speaking

283
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,760
this is outsourcing information security

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
is uh

285
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
on the state level

286
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
and

287
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,680
this such realization can work because

288
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,880
we don't make them and we don't threaten

289
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
them but we help them and state invest

290
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
in solving these problems and this can

291
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,560
be

292
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
done in the direction of some budgetary

293
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,399
organizations and maybe some commercial

294
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
organizations and right now these

295
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,320
structures at least there was an idea

296
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
and many people support it these

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
structures have to be created in

298
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
differences in oil industry in

299
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
electrical grids and many others but it

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,839
will take a lot of time and saying that

301
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
it will happen next year and

302
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,279
it's going to be the boom of security

303
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
well we should not speak about that in

304
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,639
these terms but if you will compare

305
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
russian legislation in the area of

306
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
providing informational security and

307
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,680
with foreign ones and western ones uh

308
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,079
how can you evaluate our level of

309
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
development because are we too much

310
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
behind or maybe we're ahead or maybe

311
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,639
plus minus in the same framework in

312
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,120
relation to

313
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
that instead of other countries

314
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,920
unfortunately

315
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,279
the concept

316
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,279
of regulation level and practical

317
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,120
security level

318
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,880
this is something which are not

319
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
dependent from each other well

320
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
outside of the country they will say

321
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
they were saying that market will decide

322
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
for example gdpr that i was speaking

323
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,519
about introduction of reverse penalties

324
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
it's an extraordinary measure and there

325
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
was an attempt of making companies and

326
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,680
initially it was unfortunate that the

327
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
company evaluates their own risks and

328
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,839
they make their own measures to optimize

329
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,360
their own risks

330
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
and the fact that consequences of this

331
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
incident and due to the consequences of

332
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
incidents uh uh foreign people can

333
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
suffer from it it's not regulated by the

334
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,020
legislation

335
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,320
[Music]

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,279
and this trend is maintained

337
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,399
in west it's not so over regulated the

338
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
informational security market but we

339
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
constantly see successful attacks and

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,079
sometimes these attacks these could be

341
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,480
complicated attacks and sometimes just

342
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
encoder virus

343
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
paralyzes some sectors of economy and

344
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,120
this is bad our market is over regulated

345
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
we have a lot of legal framework and

346
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,079
documents which have to be followed but

347
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,839
the effect is the same

348
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,320
no direct dependency between level of

349
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
regulation uh and the level we need to

350
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
look at practical results and it's

351
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,079
perfectly understood by our law makers

352
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,240
for example they say you have to leave

353
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
like we say but they are saying right

354
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
now okay we are going to help you

355
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,360
because we're going to have the problem

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
well it's very hard to say to see what's

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,959
going to be the result of this okay the

358
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,720
final question that i have to you about

359
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
the perspectives about the development

360
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
of the legislation in the industry which

361
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,199
is related to the information security

362
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
what should we expect in the nearest

363
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,720
future

364
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
well out of the hot things we should

365
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
expect reinforcement of legislation in

366
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,079
the area of application security

367
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,440
this is development of the legal

368
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,000
framework in the central bank this is

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,279
also legal documents in stack which are

370
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
going to be reinforcing the set of

371
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,760
measures directed analysis of threats

372
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
vulnerabilities assessment of protection

373
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
defense etc on one side this is a

374
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,760
positive moment because

375
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,600
this is a direct transfer from paper

376
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,480
security to practical security but we

377
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,079
are going to face lack of specialists

378
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
who know how to do it and we see this

379
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
lack of specialists even today what else

380
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
we should expect

381
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
temporary reinforcement of pressure

382
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,760
and security from the side of the

383
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
business uh for example central bank how

384
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
can we make banks be involved in

385
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,639
security

386
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
we can penalize them we can punish them

387
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,880
by removing their license central

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
banking in another direction

389
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,319
they connect to the level of protection

390
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,360
[Music]

391
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
they have a certain credit policy and

392
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,959
they increase the level of reservation

393
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,680
so they reduce the possibility of the

394
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
bank to earn money insufficient defense

395
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
is an obstacle in development of the

396
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
business and bank has economical

397
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
interest to invest into security same

398
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,719
thing we can see

399
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
in the degree 250 on the attempt of

400
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
making the same approach so we rely on

401
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
responsibility for the incidents we are

402
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
laying it on the ceo of the company so

403
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
basically speaking on the top manager of

404
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
the company

405
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
without giving any money for the

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
security they are risking to carry

407
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
personal responsibility for the

408
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,959
consequences

409
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,959
also personal interest of the owner of

410
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
the business for this business to be

411
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
protected if he really afraid of these

412
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,800
consequences

413
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,959
there are three key things influencing

414
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,160
the real

415
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
protectedness of the business

416
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
company industry and the whole state

417
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,560
it's technologies

418
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,600
it's legislation and education

419
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,120
only together they can build protection

420
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
which can really prevent hacker attacks

421
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,040
when person knows why defense is being

422
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
made when technologies are mature enough

423
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,519
and the portfolio of technological

424
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,320
solutions is really wide to provide this

425
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,360
level of defense and when the

426
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
legislation should fully help

427
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,320
to embody into practice

428
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,720
all these intentions

429
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,319
which were available inside of the

430
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,199
companies and industries for their uh

431
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,039
defense for their security and i think

432
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,119
that in russia would you have very big

433
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,559
movements in this direction from the

434
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,679
side of the legislation directed at

435
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,559
achievement of real security of our

436
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,160
country thank you very much dmitry thank

437
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,720
