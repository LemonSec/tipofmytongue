data leaks let me introduce the

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,840

head of socie reform colleagues let's

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,719
begin

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,040
with the beginning

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,079
so imagine that you are

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,120
an

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,760
employee

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,920
of the

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
county hacker group not an employee but

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
part of the group and

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,960
you leaked

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
your

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,480
ransomware

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
can you

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,519
go to the russian court of law to

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,400
protect your right

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
so but do we need that i would pretend

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
that everything's all right and

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
carry out a pr program that we are open

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
transparent but i'll never go to the

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
russian court of law of course i have

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
that right yes but

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
if i am a hacker a real hacker i don't

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,320
need it at all

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
if you

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
are a clandestine

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,640
member of the well whether i need it or

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
i don't see any sense i don't see any

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,600
point to be protected by law

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
so

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,320
everything that

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
died is not useful

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
i will not punish anyone for that leak

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,960
the data has leaked and

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
it is no longer

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,920
valuable for me

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
thank you oleg the question is to you

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
is there any sense to go to the russian

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,720
court if data is leaked

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
what are the prospects

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
in that kind in russian reality or if

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
data has leaked it's leaked in our

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,640
industry

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,760
the practice of going to court

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
is not known

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,800
we believe that such procedure

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
requires a lot of resources takes a lot

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,480
of time

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
and actually doesn't bring any positive

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
results

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
so

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,879
what can we do in that case to minimize

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,480
risk to compensate losses

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,200
to punish the

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
cyber criminal

68
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
but in

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
what can we really reach

70
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,519
of course we can

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,440
lose part of reputation

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
but the whole country will

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
know that

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,720
we have been broken compromised our data

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,120
leaked it's better not to tell anyone

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
eliminate

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
the consequences find out why it

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,000
happened and close the gap

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
vasily what about you what's your

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,959
opinion

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
what about going to court

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
please switch on your microphone oh yes

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
i would support the colleagues who

84
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
didn't have such experience but in

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,799
general

86
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,599
the incidents happened

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,360
we solved those problem by the

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,599
managed top management of the company

89
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
it's a good subject to discuss

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
in different quarters artyom

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,519
i fully agree with dmitry that i

92
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
wouldn't go to any kind of courts

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
it's a good pr campaign if i am a county

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,519
uh manager i would generate a new

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
version and say that all this is

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,959
unconfirmed uh

97
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,840
and

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,319
this is one more

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
pr action as a result

100
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,880
it's useless to go to court

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
and then

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
everyone will know who is behind conti

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
why do i need that alexander what about

104
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
dlp vendor

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,720
is it useful to go to court or is it

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
better to conceal the fact of data leak

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
briefly we have to go to court but what

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
about the precedence our experience

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
shows

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,520
i know personally at least

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
one customer who has a procedure

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
of going to court

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
all the people ha signed appropriate

114
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,919
documents for that and i have another

115
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,599
company who deals with hardware leasing

116
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
they

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,400
had several presidents when they

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
brought some of their employees to court

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,800
for data leaks but everything is within

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
the russian

121
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,199
legislation all such incidents they

122
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
tried to

123
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
solve through the court of law

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,080
there was another incident when internal

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
investigation found a well organized

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
group

127
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
evaluated the

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
damage

129
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,919
then went to that group saw them the

130
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,720
materials and said we are going to court

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
and they

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
compensated the damage

133
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,680
without going to court so the court can

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,400
be

135
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
can serve as a threat

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,639
to potential

137
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
cyber criminals

138
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,199
so you are the only person who said

139
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
that you do that what is the practice

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
what has the company

141
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,840
to do

142
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
to make such

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
going to court

144
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
valuable and useful

145
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
first of all

146
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,639
you must impose

147
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,759
a

148
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,919
mode of commercial

149
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,039
secret

150
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,319
it should be well described what kind of

151
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,120
data is confidential what kind of data

152
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
is critical you have to train your

153
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
employees so that in their labor

154
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
contracts he had to sign

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
that all the information generated at

156
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,960
his in the office belongs to the company

157
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
and so on so forth if such

158
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
security

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
foundation is ready then

160
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
the governor the court of law

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,520
can

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,960
regard the situation there were other

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,919
presidents when dlp was installed

164
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,080
clandestinely

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,479
without any signatures without any

166
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,680
documents without any paper security

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
practices then

168
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,039
the top manager wanted to bring his

169
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
employee to court but the court said no

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
what are the grounds

171
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
for the case there is no case

172
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
no one signed anything no one made any

173
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,039
commitments so what

174
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
so in order to

175
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,919
monitor the situation you must have

176
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,240
legal grounds

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
so what about methodological case

178
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
alexander said you must prepare the

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,680
paper documents to bring them to court

180
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
do you see

181
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,919
an employee who is

182
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
blamed for data leaks can you say that

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
there is a constitution

184
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,639
uh

185
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
article 23 the secret of

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
postal exchanges

187
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,720
you cannot read my mails so if i have in

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,759
such situation if i am

189
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,400
blamed for data leak i would use a

190
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
different strategy

191
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
the biggest problem is to

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
say that this paper this report

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,199
it's not secret

194
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,159
is it commercial secret or is it not

195
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,640
it's very difficult to convince

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
that and many people

197
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,039
said that this document is officially

198
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
without a secret or confidential stamp

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
but the data within that document is it

200
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,160
secret or is it not

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
so

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
what kind of pressure

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
you can apply on the

204
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
on your employee

205
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
of course

206
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,800
and i will

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
evaluate if i'm that employee

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
uh i must evaluate the pressure the

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
possible consequences and sometimes

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
come to terms with the management or i

211
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,839
may say that no you are wrong you are

212
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,399
absolutely wrong this is

213
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,440
non-confidential you have no right to

214
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
read my mails and so on but never rely

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,440
uh

216
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
on constitution it makes no sense

217
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
so

218
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,839
do you think

219
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,000
those positions are correct or not

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,399
correct for you personally what do you

221
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
do when you try to

222
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
protect against data leaks

223
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,040
colleagues first of all

224
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,279
my advice is be friendly to your lawyers

225
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
because my experience shows that we have

226
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
situations when

227
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
there were a lot of documents published

228
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
in the company about

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
data security

230
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
with good lawyers

231
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
we come to the same conclusion what we

232
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
can do and what can really be protected

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
an example

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
in one

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
legal department

236
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
they looked at the normative base at

237
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,600
regulatory base and say no

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
you know we can look

239
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
from two points of view from the point

240
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,279
of view of an employer and an employee

241
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,880
and we have to

242
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,839
balance the interests of the employer

243
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
and of the employee

244
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
so that the employee rights and the

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
employer rights could be balanced

246
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,600
to

247
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,880
the benefit of both

248
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,000
uh

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
we see continuous changes and we must

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,399
monitor those changes

251
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,600
well-defined

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
data security policy or commercial

253
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,880
secret policy should be reviewed

254
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
on a regular basis

255
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
because in some cases

256
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
people

257
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,800
violate some rules but we realize that

258
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,760
the environment has changed

259
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
and actually we cannot punish that

260
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
employee because the situation is

261
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
different the requirements are already

262
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
different they changed from the since

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
the moment the document was published so

264
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,760
we have to continuously monitor the

265
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,839
situation and the changes so that's it

266
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
these are the points i wanted to make

267
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
in general thank you

268
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,399
oleg

269
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
what about you

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,600
in our company the approach is as

271
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,040
follows

272
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,839
wisdom from

273
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,839
the fact that

274
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,880
we have to build paper security first of

275
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
all to have a foundation basis for

276
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,000
further actions

277
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,399
including bringing an employee to court

278
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,880
and in principle

279
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
it often happens that availability of

280
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
such documents

281
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
and the fact of the

282
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,880
employee knowing about that document is

283
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,839
a good

284
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,560
factor which prevents

285
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,439
data leaks

286
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,079
in one of the previous companies that i

287
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,120
worked

288
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
there was a case when

289
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,240
an employee of a government agency

290
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,200
took information out of the company we

291
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
didn't go to court

292
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
the person was immediately fired

293
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
and

294
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
that person

295
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
couldn't

296
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
protest because that was the least

297
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,839
punishment he could

298
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,399
take

299
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
so the situation is continuously

300
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
changing

301
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,279
how easy it is to continuously support

302
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,600
the list of

303
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
information assets and their location to

304
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,760
keep it up to date because of jive

305
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,959
and the clouds and virtual things and

306
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
containers

307
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
continue are continuously moving and the

308
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,360
security people do not always know

309
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,519
why they

310
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,680
were relocated

311
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
and if they don't know where they are

312
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,360
how can we

313
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
blame

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,279
the

315
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:47,840
employees

316
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,079
[Music]

317
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,959
it's very difficult

318
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,680
how in the agile world

319
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,320
to keep the list of

320
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
information assets up to date

321
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
so that is difficult

322
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
i am not a specialist in paper

323
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
documents i am

324
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
about digital documents

325
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,959
if we look at clouds containers

326
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,959
which we cannot trace

327
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,079
we have solutions

328
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
other protection tools who are not

329
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
linked to dlp we have pump systems

330
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,600
we have protection deficit ops

331
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
which that we control

332
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
a new container appeared and we monitor

333
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
it

334
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,480
and i believe

335
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,399
talking about the future of dlp dlp is

336
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,959
not needed in many cases

337
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,920
uh

338
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,320
what is a leak

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,639
a new container

340
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
the self-learning system

341
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,839
can

342
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
generate such a procedure a new

343
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,839
container a new port

344
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,880
traffic through that port

345
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,079
you can

346
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,519
believe that this is sort of an anomaly

347
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,440
and all those solutions all our

348
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,570
solutions should find anomalies

349
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,360
[Music]

350
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,320
the first annually analysis systems were

351
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
not quite popular but i expect a new

352
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,560
wave of such technologies because to

353
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
track

354
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
everything in the heterogeneous

355
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,639
environment is very difficult we have

356
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
good examples of uh

357
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
forensic incidents

358
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
it's very important to see data leak

359
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,959
forensics to see that we have a data

360
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,279
leak in that container for this user

361
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,079
name

362
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
so to see the entire chain of events

363
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440
uh until the destination point uh we

364
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
believe that in future such cases would

365
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
be quite interesting tima to continue

366
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
about methodology how can we

367
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,880
keep

368
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,519
the data up to date in a continuously

369
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
changing environment

370
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,720
is it

371
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
possible at all

372
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,279
for

373
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
modern to modern

374
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
data security people or shall we skip it

375
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
and ignore it for the time being

376
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,880
honestly i would forget about commercial

377
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
secrets

378
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,160
and look at what is really happening

379
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
if you see that

380
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,759
something is leaking outside

381
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,560
so you shouldn't think about whether

382
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
it's commercial secret or not commercial

383
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,800
secret because a leak is a leak a person

384
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,279
is taking something out of your company

385
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,079
or

386
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,240
your perimeter is broken and data was

387
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
stolen these are two different things

388
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,919
the internal

389
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,520
leaks

390
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
are dangerous but they're dealt with in

391
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
one way hackers are dealt with in

392
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
another way

393
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
our main losses are losses from negative

394
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,119
pr after the data loss and we are

395
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,919
and we all know that yes people take

396
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
some data out of the company there is

397
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
nothing bad in that

398
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
but when we are broken

399
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
and they did with us whatever they want

400
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
then that is quite negative

401
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,559
and that wave is long term

402
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
sometime it may last for years

403
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
and then we are fighting against

404
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
breakthroughs against

405
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,320
uh breaking through our perimeter

406
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,840
and then only think about what exactly

407
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
has been stolen it's interesting there

408
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
are two points of view

409
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
paper security

410
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
which cannot help us in a continuously

411
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
changing world if we look at recent

412
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,880
published

413
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,640
data leaks they are due to

414
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,440
badly configured

415
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,559
or

416
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,080
breakthrough

417
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
from internal

418
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,320
employee who has access rights

419
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
it's

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
very difficult to

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,240
talk in terms of classical dap

422
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
dlp dlp

423
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,919
so a person who has access rights

424
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
got access to date and

425
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
took data from your company

426
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
stole it

427
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
for some time or cloud

428
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
the league channels are quite different

429
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,360
in the clouds

430
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,080
different from the classical channels

431
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,360
like

432
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,440
usb keys emails paper security

433
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,880
of course cannot provide you 100

434
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
security it will help you to solve

435
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
controversial problems in the court of

436
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,639
law

437
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,600
when you are broken

438
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
of course you must protect against

439
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,120
external attacks

440
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
but it doesn't compromise

441
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
your paper documents

442
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,600
you always have employees who have

443
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,640
access to critical data

444
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,320
you have to

445
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
prevent breakthroughs

446
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
and also you

447
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,919
can

448
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,480
mitigate risks

449
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,080
of

450
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,240
unauthorized access

451
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,000
maybe authorized access to critical data

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
before we dealt with

453
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,919
emails or usb cards modern dlp

454
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
must be integrated with clouds

455
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
with

456
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,799
the systems that controls personal

457
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,919
devices of your employees i say personal

458
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,039
devices

459
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,559
and also take into account remote access

460
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,040
so

461
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,440
[Music]

462
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,799

466
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
vague perimeter you are talking about

467
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
the agents no

468
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
clouds remote but the channels are the

469
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
same

470
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
mail usb key

471
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,799
no let me give you an example a

472
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,880
technical one

473
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
we have customers who work with

474
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
microsoft exchange online

475
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,559
cloud mail

476
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
and they are allowed to use

477
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
smartphones

478
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
all traffic

479
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,400
mail traffic goes beyond the perimeter

480
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
and you have to take into account not

481
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,919
only

482
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,520
the mail traffic but

483
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,240
personal messengers no

484
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
you have to control

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
not the attempt of

486
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,080
taking data out of the company but

487
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
how the person

488
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,400
works with enterprise data how

489
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
he is addressing the data you have to

490
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,520
integrate office

491
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,679
365 and the cloud to see what is

492
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,080
published what is downloaded

493
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,559
so we have to act not at the moment when

494
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,360
data already left your company but

495
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
to integrate with the business system

496
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,960
and see how the employee is actually

497
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
working

498
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,120
so again

499
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,679
that is

500
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,640
employee control channel control and

501
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
employee control as well for example

502
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,840
open looking at the internet there

503
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,240
is no

504
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
employee no channel

505
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,880
it's a problem of infrastructure if one

506
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,679
element of infrastructure is directly

507
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,559
connected to open internet what are we

508
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,080
discussing then

509
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,439
vasily what about you

510
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,120
two positions two points alexander said

511
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
that dlp should be remain

512
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,400
here it should be advanced

513
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
dmitry said you have to monitor

514
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,559
everything and then to see whether the

515
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,320
data is confidential or non-confidential

516
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,960
so from the point of view of a customer

517
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,600
and user and services what is your

518
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
position

519
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
it's a philosophical question actually

520
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
but it's very

521
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,440
specific and concrete well dlp

522
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,840
from the point of view of a user it's a

523
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,520
good tool one of the tools and we all

524
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,080
realize that security

525
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,360
is a set of protective measures

526
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
uh protection of channels protection of

527
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
against external devices

528
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
and we can talk a lot about it

529
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
i believe that

530
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,240
the combined solution

531
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
complex solution

532
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
it's not about dlp

533
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
becoming advanced but about you it's

534
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
about using advanced solutions all kind

535
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
of solutions integrated solutions some

536
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,520
time ago when we started deploying dlp

537
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
and cm

538
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,720
what was it

539
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
we just installed something run

540
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,240
something it works it runs some data

541
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,559
comes to me us

542
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,679
a month ago we realized oh we have dlp

543
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,159
let us see how it works

544
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,840
uh with this and

545
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,640
we monitor

546
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
what do we monitor

547
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,279
it's good that we have when we have 24

548
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,360
by 7 services monitoring sla

549
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,960
incidents

550
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
now we see

551
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,520
gaps

552
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,480
consequences

553
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
and here

554
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,720
well

555
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,480
once again it's a philosophical question

556
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
and each person tries to solve it in his

557
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
own way

558
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
some people outsource it and forget

559
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
about it it's the simplest way

560
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
no

561
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,600
but

562
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,919
the question is who will be held

563
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,880
responsible because monitoring is just

564
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,320
monitoring you cannot

565
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,799
place responsibility on someone it's

566
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,200
just a tool

567
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,840
if at the

568
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,000
enterprise you can

569
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,799
install your own internal monitoring

570
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,960
center

571
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
well it's just a tool

572
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,080
and your employees are tools

573
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,799
including the functions of data security

574
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,880
so it's difficult it's hard

575
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
for me personally to answer your

576
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,880
question from the viewpoint of a user

577
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,600
but

578
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,080
a few words about paper security

579
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,200
it's my personal experience

580
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,080
i have many cases when yes

581
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,520
we

582
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,720
prevented

583
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,159
incidents we carried out investigations

584
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,120
but even after that

585
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,380
where is the legal grounds

586
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,880
[Music]

587
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
where are the legal grounds

588
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,559
you

589
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,480
told us that the enterprise has assets

590
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
and many people will agree that

591
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,520
few people

592
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,480
do inventory every day because

593
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,279
infrastructure is huge and we don't

594
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,360
exactly know what appeared what

595
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,120
disappeared an incident happens

596
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
in our infrastructure

597
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,720
and we look well what kind of

598
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,039
infrastructure element was it it wasn't

599
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,320
even

600
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,799
inventorized

601
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
and what do we have to do if this

602
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,440
element was installed but never

603
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,880
registered

604
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,320
so the fact of violation is

605
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
here but from the legal point of view we

606
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,919
cannot do anything because legally the

607
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,640
element doesn't exist so i do not divide

608
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
paper and digital

609
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,279
uh documentation it should all be

610
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,919
confirmed and combined we install

611
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,440
hardware we paid the money and but where

612
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,240
is the result of our work

613
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,760
yes thank you thank you oleg

614
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,559
from your experience

615
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,000
dlp

616
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
does it make sense uh to

617
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
use the

618
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,679
p if we don't

619
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
if you're not able to run full inventory

620
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,080
of the assets when they're being updated

621
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
all the time and it might be easier uh

622
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,480
as dimitri said uh to investigate

623
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,679
any incident uh that arrives and whether

624
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,919
the confidential information was there

625
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
was not it's not important and who

626
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,960
will have to do that

627
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,320
the security service or it can be

628
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,960
outsourced so that some

629
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,080
external ethos you do the monitoring and

630
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,440
if needed

631
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
tell the customer hey guys you have

632
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
leakages take measures organizational

633
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,520
ones

634
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,240
go to the

635
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
relevant organizations and let them come

636
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
and punish

637
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,960
from our experience of running dlp and

638
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,440
resource inventory

639
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
we see them as absolutely unrelated

640
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
things

641
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
dlp monitors

642
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
probable leakage channels and

643
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,320
when certain

644
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,159
triggers of sensitive information are

645
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,120
found

646
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
an investigation is run

647
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,799
here in this case

648
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,120
the key thing is not

649
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
the source of

650
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
leakage

651
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,600
but the category of information and

652
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,799
content

653
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,320
as to who

654
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,840
runs this monitoring and

655
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,360
investigation we have

656
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,000
uh in-house soc

657
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,039
that were built based on zarya

658
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,840
for the knees of harass cosmos

659
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,559
i

660
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,039
used to be its head

661
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,200
until recently

662
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
so we have

663
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
uh stock

664
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,039
professional professionals

665
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,799
running a dlp

666
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,720
an investigation

667
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,919
is done

668
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:10,799
by

669
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,279
professionals working in the roscosmos

670
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,640
head office

671
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,720
so this combination

672
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,200
has been functioning uh quite well with

673
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
good results

674
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,279
so doing postmortem on some situations

675
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,360
related to some possible

676
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,440
not even leakages but

677
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
uh

678
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
in compliance

679
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,440
with

680
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,840
the procedures they're being run

681
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,600
okay thank you arjun

682
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,919
a question about the integration of a

683
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,840
dlp into stock because olex said that

684
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
dlp is monitored by

685
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,600
stock

686
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,399
but they said is quite often

687
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,120
that dlp is not included in the earth or

688
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
there are several several separate

689
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,399
people

690
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,200
in

691
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
stock who

692
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,919
do not add information to cm or dlp

693
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,559
whether just sit at the monitors and

694
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,960
watch what's happening just because the

695
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,960
dlp things don't uh always match uh

696
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,840
what's

697
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,559
what the cm and

698
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,520
zog

699
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,039
deal with so from your experience how

700
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,880
what is the right way

701
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679
to connect dlp to stock and make does it

702
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,880
make sense

703
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
whether it makes sense or it doesn't i

704
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
think it depends on the organization

705
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
in some organizations

706
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,480
uh you

707
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,320
you need to report

708
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,399
about dlp incidents

709
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,880
so how much is being spent i mean man

710
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,200
hours how many people are required to

711
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,320
plan the budget but it's not about

712
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,520
security

713
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,120
uh when we're reporting by the number of

714
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
incidents well it's not exactly about

715
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,880
the

716
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,799
security but like i uh would initiate

717
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,799
cases in erp so in europe i think dlp is

718
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,760
not needed within uh the isaq uh we just

719
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,679
had uh events say in erp

720
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,640
so that

721
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,840
any security officer would come to the

722
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
information security officer and they'll

723
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
show it this interface and that will be

724
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,679
the same source of information so i

725
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,360
think you shouldn't load this data from

726
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,000
dlp you uh you have to enter all data in

727
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,039
erp and it's no problem in facing these

728
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,480
solutions

729
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,960
so i would initiate those in

730
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,519
uh erp talk about the technology

731
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,159
monitoring uh

732
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,399
something that's missing is a technology

733
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159
report about

734
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,519
leak

735
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
investigations

736
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,480
so for instance

737
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,080
look

738
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
an accountant is sitting and then uh

739
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
requests are coming uh for a reso

740
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
resource uh that

741
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
is not quite usual

742
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,039
and then uh

743
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,559
during postmortem

744
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
you see that it was a data leak

745
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
i think

746
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
we know that security protection tools

747
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,919
our data security tools

748
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,120
lag behind

749
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,239
the dlp tools

750
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,799
if we consider

751
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,120
if you want to have a file blocked

752
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,880
i think can be done in edr and they were

753
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,200
talking about office 365

754
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,480
we can

755
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,320
build logs in cm and do uh uh hunting in

756
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,000
the same thing that will be a solution

757
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,919
within sock and we'll put a tick on the

758
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,200
box yes dlp so basically uh this is as

759
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,559
my colleague said it's a philosophical

760
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,880
question but technology wise i think in

761
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,159
the future is going to be integrated

762
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,399
into a single solution so roughly

763
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,719
speaking

764
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,600
the classic dlp dlp that we're talking

765
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,399
about you're saying are going to die out

766
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,799
and they'll be replaced by the response

767
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,120
respective functionality in cm edr and

768
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,679
others well technology was yes

769
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,960
but in russia there are a lot of

770
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
customers

771
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
that are only exposed to the world over

772
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,399
email

773
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,480
and in real life they exchange data with

774
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
flash drives

775
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,640
for such organization dlp is useful uh

776
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,919
to monitor the leakage uh over email and

777
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,480
they do it quite well and also i keep an

778
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,399
eye on removable media yes

779
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,140
so that's uh about obsolete systems

780
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,840
[Music]

781
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,960
dimitri yeah look uh

782
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,120
let me just give you an example

783
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,679
i'll use this example

784
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,760
to support what i stated previously so

785
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,679
you don't have a sock we don't have a

786
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
sock we do have we have alexi novikov

787
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,640
alex novikov and his guys

788
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
have found out that there's some

789
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,039
stream

790
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,440
and files are being uh sent over the

791
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,679
slide our traffic analyzers

792
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,200
takes these files out so what do you do

793
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
with this file so it's a document we go

794
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
through the scanner

795
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,519
if there are any viruses there we run it

796
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,039
in the sandbox

797
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,440
and nothing stands the way for us

798
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,000
to feed it into dlp and to see what it's

799
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
going to say we don't have a problem

800
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,560
with integration the question is whether

801
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,079
we need that or not and then it's a

802
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,359
question about the classification of

803
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,520
resources where this file is being sent

804
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,399
uh from is it's of interest of interest

805
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,040
to us to feed this into dlp so i don't

806
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,679
see a problem integrating how it's done

807
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
it's also quite clear

808
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
so i wouldn't count oppose these

809
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,639
the event control cm and dlp these are

810
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,359
all parts of the same multi uh function

811
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,440
solutions okay let me tell you when i

812
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,079
said we've run into into a sandbox

813
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,719
and we ran it through an iv machine

814
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,839
it's indeed clear but then you get a

815
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
question to identify whether the

816
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,040
information

817
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,839
is

818
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,239
confidential or not quite often you

819
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,599
don't have this binary answer yes or no

820
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,440
or is it

821
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
like in the

822
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,680
sandbox

823
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,240
through a scale of 100

824
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,560
like more than 97

825
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,480
it's malicious and let's do mineral

826
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,640
analysis another point that i touched

827
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,160
upon the very beginning and the main

828
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,280
problem is it's not really about dlp

829
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
the main uh problem

830
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
to provide commercial secrets how many

831
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,160
times i've seen that how many ndas i

832
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,480
have approved they're trying to cover

833
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,680
everything all knowledge about the

834
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,359
infrastructures are commercial secret

835
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,560
hey guys

836
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
think again is it really uh what no what

837
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
you cover uh with your commercial secret

838
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,160
uh status uh is of value to you what do

839
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,839
you think the knowledge of your

840
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,440
infrastructure does it deserve

841
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,000
protection you're doing it just like 99

842
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,520
percent of other companies in the market

843
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,240
do and not even seeing this information

844
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,560
i will perfectly understand how things

845
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
are segmented

846
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,960
but there is a very little uh scope

847
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,119
small scope of really important

848
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,040
resources and information and you should

849
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,720
focus on this so in our case

850
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,079
feeding a file into dlp that we've taken

851
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,880
out of uh some stream uh it's only going

852
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,599
to happen if it comes from some

853
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,680
sensitive resource let's say uh from a

854
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,400
building system from uh some other

855
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
system yes we'll take a look at that but

856
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,520
that will be a very narrow class of

857
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
information and will only be doing that

858
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,119
if we perfectly understand that uh this

859
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,200
the leakage of this particular resource

860
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,359
uh is tantamount to death for the for us

861
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,359
alexander you didn't agree with the

862
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,680
position that dlp is going to die out i

863
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,760
am i do not agree with a lot of things

864
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,240
that have been said here look uh let's

865
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,040
uh

866
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,359
discuss uh back to a couple of points as

867
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,800
the previous speaker said

868
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
what i didn't like what i was concerned

869
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,040
with

870
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,640
the inventory of information uh assets

871
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,760
and dlp are two different things no

872
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
this should be the same process and the

873
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,839
uh and keeping the policies updated

874
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,079
uh keeping everything in

875
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,079
the

876
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
consistent state classic dlp has been

877
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,240
mentioned as a swear word just like a

878
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,839
paper security

879
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,480
but yes just like paper security look

880
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,240
dlp should be modern not only

881
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
from the point of view of channels of

882
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,440
integration with cloud solutions

883
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,880
but also

884
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
in terms of the analysis technology how

885
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
it identified these incidents in the

886
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,880
data stream uh there are

887
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,280
well i've heard uh that some other tools

888
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,599
uh can

889
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,079
can analyze flash drives i'll give you a

890
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,839
simple case so we have a customer large

891
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,720
bank

892
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,640
that controls uh the movement of

893
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,400
information uh between uh the

894
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,359
compartments some super confidential

895
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,319
less confidential

896
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
and so

897
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
that a task was formulated we want to

898
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,599
control and block operations

899
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,320
in the clipboard between these two

900
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,520
these two areas we want to uh block it

901
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,280
based on the result of the analysis so

902
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,680
that for linguistics could

903
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,680
be analyzed so for instance when they

904
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
are moving information that's allowed to

905
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,119
be moved within these areas

906
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
then it should be allowed and not that

907
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,839
not so how can you do it without dlp if

908
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,839
you have thousands of events per day

909
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
oh for instance we have a customer

910
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,000
another financial organization

911
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,560
the idlp system

912
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,000
records

913
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
one and a half million events

914
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
every day

915
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,960
and this customer is using our ai

916
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
technologies to identify incidents

917
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
detect incidents

918
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,800
how can a channel control cope with this

919
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,760
a huge amount of data

920
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,599
just by just collecting data and making

921
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,839
some statements you need fully fledged

922
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,880
analysis also using ai

923
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,079
also

924
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,160
being able to

925
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,599
do automation

926
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,160
and if we say yes

927
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
the idea

928
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,640
that was born 10 years ago we have flash

929
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,720
drive here we have email here

930
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,320
we have some

931
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
regular

932
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,440
regulations then of course dlp

933
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,160
uh would be hard to use there'll be uh a

934
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,319
lot of false positives and negatives

935
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,079
if we are thinking just like people

936
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,000
thought ten years ago then yes of course

937
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,040
a dlp is a box that you put somewhere

938
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,079
that

939
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,040
has taken a look at some flash drives

940
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,960
and that's it

941
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,359
but if we're talking about a dlp system

942
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,640
that can

943
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,800
firstly dlp

944
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
has to uh protect data uh from

945
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,760
uh well in the minimum time it should

946
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,440
also help uh run uh the inventory

947
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,599
of informational assets

948
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,560
also it should be able to make some

949
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,440
decisions without human intervention

950
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,400
based on ai so this is the dlp that you

951
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,599
can use the modern world where you have

952
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,599
a million events per day but if we're

953
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,800
talking about

954
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
like they did 10 years ago then of

955
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,480
course it's a useless instrument useless

956
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,119
tools that's very briefly uh what i feel

957
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,240
about that

958
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
i could just keep discussing

959
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,399
well your position is clear thank

960
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,720
in you

961
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,000
the worship

962
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,960
of both

963
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,280
your points and your colleagues

964
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,800
who have

965
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,599
seen

966
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,839
the thought mentioned more than once

967
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,800
that inventory is very important now

968
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
there's valuable data uh there's

969
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,480
classified information and who

970
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,040
determines the value of the data one

971
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,800
thing is when i

972
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
have a list

973
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
of

974
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
sensitive information that has been

975
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,000
updated for years on the other hand how

976
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,880
to

977
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,200
match it to specific infrastructure so

978
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
in this poses table the data is

979
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,599
confidential and in the other uh was

980
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,920
very stable data not being confidential

981
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,760
so this data is valuable for the company

982
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,680
this is not who makes a decision about

983
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,640
the final list

984
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,880
that is attached to a specific

985
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,520
infrastructure uh which data is valuable

986
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,200
for the company and which not

987
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,960
we don't have

988
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,200
we don't do uh applying a list on the

989
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
infrastructure to the fields of tables

990
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,450
or databases

991
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,040
[Music]

992
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,400
just like

993
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,839
because we're a government structure

994
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,119
government organization we have a

995
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,040
certain list

996
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,760
that they feed to us from above

997
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,720
and

998
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,160
we

999
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
verify specific information

1000
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,200
for his compliance to this list

1001
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,599
either that is flowing out either is

1002
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,520
being leaked

1003
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,319
or

1004
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,520
for which

1005
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,640
the

1006
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,760
procedures of operation have changed so

1007
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,119
for instance standards

1008
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,599
exchange of conventional interaction

1009
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,760
between information between employees

1010
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,160
over email of course there are some

1011
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,359
criteria and these criteria

1012
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,200
apply to the text

1013
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
for us it's not important where this

1014
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,800
information is held well i'm sorry for

1015
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,240
interruption but this is exactly the

1016
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,920
question that i want to ask you have a

1017
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
list that comes to you from above it

1018
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,119
doesn't say

1019
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,280
that a combination of these words with

1020
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,400
these weight factors is confidential

1021
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,040
because it's yourself yourselves who

1022
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,160
define determinate and see or you can

1023
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,599
determine that a picture of the anger

1024
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,720
launcher

1025
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
that was published in a vetomastia or

1026
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,400
another newspaper is open is is public

1027
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
and some specific mentioning of angora

1028
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
the things

1029
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,400
uncorrelated information is

1030
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,160
state secret who determines this value

1031
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
well this is

1032
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,319
determined through expert

1033
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,960
activity it's for us it's defined by our

1034
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,480
customer roscosmos a corporation

1035
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,359
so

1036
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,359
it's not our process so we are receiving

1037
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,000
that as a ready-made result from them so

1038
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,160
do they send you a list or do they send

1039
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,440
you specific rules uh that you insert

1040
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,760
into your dlp system

1041
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,920
for the dlp uh we are given specific

1042
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,280
rules okay okay vasily

1043
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,200
uh who is responsible for value in your

1044
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,040
organization

1045
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
well you know

1046
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,760
before answering this question

1047
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,480
i

1048
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,319
had a discussion about data leaks you

1049
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,359
know

1050
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,400
i have a question in response

1051
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,119
a bit astray should we monitor the

1052
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,720
monitoring centers

1053
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,800
that is those people

1054
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,200
who monitor events

1055
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,839
digital information monitor information

1056
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,520
leaks and other things

1057
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,280
might yeah because

1058
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,160
you know from my experience

1059
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,720
i can say uh we started discussing uh

1060
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,599
the

1061
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,839
list of commercial

1062
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,680
commercial secrets and there's a case

1063
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,960
like when the center of monitoring

1064
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,800
collects all the data

1065
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
the dlp is doing shadow copies and

1066
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,359
everything is fine but

1067
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,680
taken together uh it always has a

1068
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,000
national secret yes yes and here we're

1069
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,160
getting a situation where what who is

1070
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
going to be published punished now

1071
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,119
answering your question

1072
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,800
regarding the list

1073
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,599
of rules or rules that come to us from

1074
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,280
the top in the first place in my

1075
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,359
understanding the organization must

1076
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,720
itself

1077
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
define

1078
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,560
which list of information

1079
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,000
it classifies as confidential

1080
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,560
but what comes to us from the top uh

1081
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,480
no question it has to be complied with

1082
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,640
but for instance if it's a design a

1083
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,160
documentation

1084
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,119
if

1085
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,240
it's about some innovation uh projects

1086
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,200
uh

1087
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,960
for future development

1088
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,280
so a good question at which point this

1089
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,480
information

1090
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,000
stops being confidential

1091
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,000
and so there's only expert methods that

1092
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,119
we could use and again coming back

1093
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,800
we need to continuously uh modify

1094
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,960
and update the rules

1095
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,200
of detection

1096
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,880
because indeed it can also

1097
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,760
be passed into automation tools so that

1098
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,839
the system should itself

1099
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,680
detect but the human factor

1100
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,960
of course should be the final point here

1101
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,440
and then you can build correlation see

1102
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
how it's going to evolve

1103
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,000
further on uh well

1104
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,920
an example

1105
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,160
rustic

1106
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,760
they

1107
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,880
a cad

1108
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,000
to

1109
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,599
design uh some uh products it can be

1110
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,240
autodesk or as corn doesn't matter and

1111
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,040
then

1112
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,520
following some interaction a certain

1113
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,599
file as a cad file uh is passed so

1114
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,520
within the organization how to determine

1115
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
if this information is confidential or

1116
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,400
not

1117
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,680
it's a good question

1118
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,920
uh and i i'll give you a very simple

1119
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,200
answer to this

1120
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,359
little piece in one of the glp systems

1121
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,119
there's

1122
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,000
the

1123
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,240
function of taking

1124
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,280
a

1125
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,599
blueprint a print from

1126
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,960
so you need to take a print from

1127
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,280
the information and drone analysis so

1128
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,680
the designer who built

1129
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,000
this

1130
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,440
blueprint or drafts

1131
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
they can take a copy and say it's

1132
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,880
confidential you feel a bit critical

1133
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,119
about that yeah we

1134
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,400
write a lot of secret documents you take

1135
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
a set of open information from the

1136
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,720
internet from our researchers around a

1137
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,200
certain analysis and then this analysis

1138
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,400
in the secret report

1139
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,160
the biggest my biggest problem is to

1140
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,960
make it so that the primary

1141
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,880
publication could be publishable because

1142
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,440
on the one hand this text is published

1143
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,760
from open sources on the other hand this

1144
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,079
text is part of a secret report and

1145
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,480
nobody other than myself or my employees

1146
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,240
won't be able to say which information

1147
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,920
this report is open and which one is

1148
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,680
secret when they're telling that someone

1149
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,240
needs to do that and so my question is

1150
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,880
look is it my function uh to highlight

1151
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,599
paragraphs i was young and foolish and

1152
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,880
was taking

1153
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,119
part in the learned council

1154
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,720
there was a

1155
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,079
phd defense so the system was

1156
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:48,960
like

1157
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,480
to identify the physical location of a

1158
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,920
ship

1159
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,760
by pictures

1160
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,520
so one could

1161
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,880
exactly

1162
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
identify where the ship is

1163
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,000
and i said

1164
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,800
do you have a database of samples of

1165
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,720
ocean water in different points of the

1166
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,599
earth of course the management

1167
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,920
immediately asked me not to put not to

1168
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,319
embarrass people but in

1169
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,359
in practice it can be a very

1170
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,680
uh difficult uh to differentiate between

1171
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
confidential information so that's why

1172
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,280
of course skeptical about using

1173
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,240
effective dlp except uh for the cases

1174
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,319
well we know for sure that a certain

1175
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,200
class of documents is

1176
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,400
vital for us so we'll do everything to

1177
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,240
highlight every paragraph and we'll be

1178
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,119
tracking this information such red

1179
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,319
paragraphs

1180
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,400
thank you alexander what would you like

1181
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,359
to say

1182
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,200
i'm really

1183
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,119
i can't wait now that you've mentioned

1184
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,920
the rockets

1185
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,559
just calm down come down look again

1186
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,880
everything is in the details technology

1187
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,280
details let me give you an example i'll

1188
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,119
be talking about technology

1189
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,839
for instance we have a technology

1190
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,559
of

1191
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,800
vector prince for instance so you have a

1192
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,920
blueprint of a tank

1193
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,400
or an array of

1194
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,960
a secret part

1195
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,920
you put this uh

1196
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,359
draft into dlpu you you mean what who if

1197
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,680
it's about a tank then from my

1198
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,359
experience i used to work in the

1199
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,599
military industry defense industry

1200
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,760
after university it's about interaction

1201
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,559
uh between security department

1202
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,160
and i.t security department

1203
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,319
so this is the synergy of the east

1204
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,839
organization so an i.t guy is given

1205
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,720
a set of data

1206
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,440
you know there are i.t people 90 people

1207
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,720
oh yeah

1208
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,559
so

1209
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,960
we were feeding this we're feeding uh

1210
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,000
this uh tank drafted into a dlp system

1211
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,720
uh look at this case quite often uh

1212
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,760
defense

1213
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,040
uh

1214
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,680
factories uh are dual purpose yes a tank

1215
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,240
can be used so to

1216
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,079
sow the fields okay of course and you

1217
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,359
can use to fight

1218
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,160
so and then imagine a bad guy has

1219
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,520
inserted

1220
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,960
uh some uh elements of the tank design

1221
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,559
into a tractor

1222
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,280
that's a barrel well

1223
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,680
i wouldn't go as far as that so they

1224
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,559
even have taken this out uh remove the

1225
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,839
details and sent our dlp system

1226
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,280
uh would

1227
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,800
uh disassemble every uh draft into

1228
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,079
graphic

1229
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,280
primitives and it will identify it it

1230
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,359
will detect it it will detect the

1231
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,520
presence of confidential parts the same

1232
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,640
can be done with a set of parts for

1233
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,200
instance we have

1234
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,839
some sets of parts so that we haven't

1235
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,440
published anywhere it's under

1236
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,520
development oh so that applies to

1237
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,920
civilian uh products as well for

1238
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,599
instance we haven't given it to any

1239
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,359
subcontractors

1240
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,559
so so any

1241
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,640
draft that doesn't seem to be

1242
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,920
confidential if it has uh this uh part

1243
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,079
from that other list uh

1244
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,960
there then it could be detected

1245
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,480
there was a question about

1246
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,720
the database containing confidential

1247
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,480
information again let me give you a

1248
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,520
specific case we have a customer a large

1249
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,240
retail organization for which the main

1250
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,440
information

1251
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,720
assets is the information about their

1252
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,400
purchasing prices

1253
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
so

1254
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,480
the

1255
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,800
most confidential information is the

1256
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,599
purchasing price for let's say

1257
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,559
sweets

1258
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,960
the problem with this information is

1259
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,119
that you can't classify it you won't be

1260
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,680
able to

1261
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,040
institute

1262
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,359
to institute regulations for tens of

1263
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,079
thousands of items so you need to have a

1264
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,599
special technology that would be

1265
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,720
integrated with a crm or an erp system

1266
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,280
so that all information about suppliers

1267
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,480
should always be updated and any message

1268
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,240
going outside the company

1269
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,480
should be scanned to find

1270
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,359
uh mention of this information but again

1271
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,839
you have uh to do it in a specific

1272
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,520
technology case if uh this system uh is

1273
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
uh tasked to

1274
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,760
find fragments of confidential

1275
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,880
information in uh other documents

1276
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,200
uh for instance we have a case where the

1277
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,680
customer

1278
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,960
protects

1279
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,119
the

1280
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,559
secret maps very much

1281
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,200
so again back to my idea uh thinking the

1282
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,480
way people were doing 10 years ago then

1283
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,040
okay a dlp system makes no use and if we

1284
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,079
say that a dlp system uh is capable of

1285
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,599
processing a huge sets of data has a

1286
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,720
machine

1287
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,079
computer vision on board and ai then

1288
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,800
it's absolutely different dlp system so

1289
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,240
colleagues thank you

1290
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,240
we have gradually come up to the end of

1291
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,400
our discussion discussion as usual we're

1292
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,240
not going to arrive at the same

1293
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,400
conclusion and i haven't had the time to

1294
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,480
ask all of my questions but i'd like to

1295
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,280
ask one for every one of you

1296
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,680
so that you could answer yesterday a

1297
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,599
ministry of digital development

1298
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,359
representative

1299
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,240
said

1300
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
that

1301
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,720
the legislation is going to be changed

1302
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,440
so that the organization can be fined by

1303
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,040
one percent

1304
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,000
of uh its revenue for the leakage of

1305
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,720
personal data let's start with ation uh

1306
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,160
if this

1307
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,040
law uh is enacted and we have no doubt

1308
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,839
that it will uh how it will

1309
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,640
change the situation with data leaks are

1310
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,319
there going to be fewer uh or uh

1311
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,079
is it just that the price

1312
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,839
will go up

1313
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,960
indeed it's a very difficult question

1314
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,839
well perhaps there would be a certain

1315
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,040
decline in the beginning but on the

1316
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,680
whole the trend would be upwards

1317
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,839
because the volume of information is

1318
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,000
going to grow the number of

1319
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,079
channels of links is going to grow so

1320
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,599
the total stream is not going to go down

1321
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,839
so you mean to say that this draft law

1322
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,960
is not going uh to reduce the number of

1323
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,000
leagues and fines will not be a big

1324
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,760
incentive for companies think about that

1325
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,680
well if you take banks they also have

1326
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,880
regulators

1327
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,440
that have fines so i think

1328
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,119
a company that

1329
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,040
is backwards is really concerned about

1330
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,720
this data

1331
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,960
for them everything will remain the same

1332
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,200
for other companies maybe they will add

1333
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,880
some new technology to protect

1334
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,040
themselves from leagues put something on

1335
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,440
the perimeter

1336
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,200
to see if any new databases have

1337
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,720
appeared or not but on the whole i think

1338
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,040
there won't be a big surge

1339
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,920
or drop in the number of

1340
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,720
uh leaks uh the price uh well the dark

1341
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,720
net will probably adjust and will say

1342
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,960
that now the prices are higher

1343
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,160
dimitri

1344
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,200
well just repeating the european

1345
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,839
uh experience gdpr

1346
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,119
uh imposes a a

1347
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,680
revenue fee you know a revenue a fine of

1348
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,079
up to four percent of revenue

1349
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,119
so uh who needs personal data

1350
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,440
oh well uh the leakage of personal data

1351
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,000
does not

1352
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,200
does not

1353
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,559
reflect damages on the operator

1354
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,559
but once uh it is fined relative to the

1355
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,839
revenue

1356
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,960
uh then more of uh operators and

1357
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,160
carriers uh will uh invest uh start

1358
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,640
investing in the protection so something

1359
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,480
will start working the market somebody

1360
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,160
will earn in the market but the problem

1361
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,319
is not going to be sold

1362
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,839
well no it's not the point

1363
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,839
quite often you come

1364
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,839
well while i was working in a bank you

1365
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,000
need to get protected what are going to

1366
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,520
lose if

1367
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,040
we lose some data

1368
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,400
so is the la is are we going to be

1369
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,720
stripped of our license no

1370
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,400
uh are we going to be fined okay

1371
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,240
yes uh

1372
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,480
what doesn't damage the bank uh the it

1373
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,760
does damage the society and the society

1374
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,920
wants to get protected so this is a case

1375
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,000
where the society creates a tool that

1376
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,480
makes a business use tools to protect

1377
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,040
the society so uh the

1378
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,640
there's nothing radical to be expected

1379
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,880
but i think near the moment is in the

1380
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,280
right direction oleg will it be affected

1381
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,040
by the law if it's adopted

1382
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,160
i suppose uh it's not going to affect us

1383
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,280
directly

1384
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,400
but

1385
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,280
it can affect the uh industry

1386
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,880
organizations because just like

1387
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,200
everywhere in the country

1388
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,079
just like uh it is in the market

1389
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,000
so to speak

1390
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,480
there's a practice

1391
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,079
of

1392
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,200
assessing

1393
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,280
the

1394
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,920
importance of introducing some

1395
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,160
protection measures

1396
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,359
based on

1397
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,960
the

1398
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,680
we need so a fine of uh five to six uh

1399
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,559
50 to 60 000 rubles uh of course is not

1400
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,799
serious enough for companies just like

1401
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,160
let's say a

1402
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
one percent of the revenue maybe it will

1403
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,200
put some companies to improve you know

1404
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,520
their security organization so i think i

1405
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,920
think uh i will agree it's a certain

1406
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,880
step

1407
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,280
towards a more effective protection of

1408
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,359
personal data it's not a panacea it's

1409
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,119
not a silver bullet but it's a step in

1410
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,000
the right direction thank you vasily

1411
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,559
let me paraphrase this

1412
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,720
i will change the question

1413
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,160
does it mean that big operators will set

1414
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,880
up the one day firm firms to process

1415
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,920
data

1416
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,960
you know with the revenue of 10 000 and

1417
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,240
those

1418
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,760
tiny

1419
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,000
companies will be fined

1420
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,040
and will bear response responsibility

1421
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,720
well it's a good

1422
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,599
opportunity a good tool

1423
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,839
that would make

1424
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,880
operators review their security

1425
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,319
in greater detail the colleagues

1426
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,040
already said that one of the paradigms

1427
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,880
for ceos what is the fine ah it's small

1428
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,640
no problem

1429
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,359
perhaps now they are going to have a

1430
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,880
different opinion on that in general i

1431
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,720
cannot say whether

1432
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,359
they are going to set up

1433
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,440
fake one day

1434
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,359
long firms

1435
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,880
i don't know

1436
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,799
maybe if so

1437
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,960
let's wait and see but

1438
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,400
personally i think this is the right way

1439
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,680
by the way

1440
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,480
you should have

1441
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,680
a liver

1442
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,839
to

1443
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,040
make business

1444
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,400
improve its security and for cybersec

1445
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,440
people it's a good opportunity

1446
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,040
to say well

1447
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,319
we have to have higher wages alexander

1448
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,160
will your market grow yes by all means

1449
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,160
that's all

1450
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,879
i want to add

1451
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,920
some people are skeptical about fines

1452
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,040
okay

1453
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,799
data leaked well 50 000 i'll pay that

1454
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,200
fine no problem

1455
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,319
for some

1456
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,559
companies it's like that

1457
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,880
this is an example

1458
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,280
there was a bank

1459
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,559
for the bank and some people fight

1460
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,720
against data leaks not because they are

1461
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,440
afraid of fines but they will lose

1462
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,480
reputation and they will lose vip

1463
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,319
customers

1464
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,520
also

1465
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,200
paper security

1466
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,559
the right

1467
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,680
the correct paper security is a reminder

1468
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,079
of the for the employee that he will

1469
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,160
bear responsibility

1470
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,839
and compensate losses

1471
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,880
incurred on the company if you

1472
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,640
compile the right paper documents okay

1473
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,839
thank you

1474
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,720
colleagues i would like to thank all the

1475
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,440
participants all those who answered my

1476
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,680
question i would like to thank you all

1477
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,400
who

1478
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,559
listened to our

1479
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,520
answers we didn't find any specific

1480
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,319
solutions we didn't have such tasks task

1481
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,440
anyway

1482
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,240
but we discussed a number of things a

1483
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,640
number of like facts

1484
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,440
were

1485
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,280
voiced and

1486
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,960
you might use them

1487
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,760
but to summarize yes

1488
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,799
protection against data leaks is a

1489
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:23,200
multifaceted task it's a paper task it's

1490
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,599
a technical task and there is no silver

1491
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,839
bullet there is no one

1492
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,680
product that would fit

1493
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,200
all but business is going to optimize

1494
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,359
its activities

1495
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,040
since regulation is becoming more harsh

1496
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,040
i think

1497
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,480
regulation will also fail to solve this

1498
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,359
problem altogether but if you work in

1499
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,400
cyber security in the next few years you

1500
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,520
will have even more work due to our

1501
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,079
regulatory activities who think about

1502
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,440
the market

1503
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,520
to a greater extent than they think

1504
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,079
about us as their citizens so at this

1505
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,960
point i would like to complete our

1506
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,240
section will see you at other sections

1507
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,479
thank you
