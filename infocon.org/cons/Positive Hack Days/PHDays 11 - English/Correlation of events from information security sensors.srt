00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,080
hello everyone i'm alex guze from

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
infotax i will be speaking about the

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,359
correlation of events

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,040
the type of

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
correlation which will

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,880
help us identify apt attacks in a

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,279
simpler way i will be showing just one

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,480
particular

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,770
case

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,948
[Music]

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
what would be difficult to defend them

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,199
and this attacks their multi staged and

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,920
distributed in time

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
if we do this analysis like it was this

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
attack may take

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,960
from a few minutes to six months and

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
even longer so

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
define and detect an apt attack

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,640
by one sensor sometimes it's not

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
possible

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
only if you get light

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,879
lucky

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,239
or if sock works well and

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
another condition is that the sensors

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,520
are different

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
and they employ different principles and

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
they can give this information different

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
formats with different content

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,799
number three

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,880
unfortunately there is just

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
so-called information noise all these

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,799
sensors may

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
have false positive

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
reaction and if there are dozens and

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
dozens of sensors such noise created by

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,840
false positives

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,119
is significant

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,600
and a small number of events

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,479
of

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,079
signaling the attack

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
may just

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,759
simply

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
dilute there if there's no way to

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
classify

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
the incidents sometimes the sock

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,600
employees may just simply ignore some of

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,799
such events

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,479
and there may be

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,720
violating sensors

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
detectors and

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
anomaly

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,399
detecting

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
sensors they say that something

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
strange has happened but they are not

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,159
saying

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,000
what tactics

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
behind it that's our source data

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,040
what's good with this correlation

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
and i would like to say that this slide

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
does not explain anything yet about how

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
to remove the noise it just explains

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,959
what this correlation algorithm does

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
on the left here there are sensors and a

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
big number of events

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
it doesn't really matter what it works

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,920
like

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
in the middle there is a correlation

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
module and there is something going on

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
in there and on the right hand side

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
there is a possible attack possible

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,879
attack

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,480
includes the events

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,680
that relate to it and that get there by

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
some kind of algorithm

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,840
and all possible uh

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
criticality levels and they demonstrate

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
how dangerous this attack may be

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
what's more important here is that that

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
there may be hundreds and thousands

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
times less attacks

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,319
than

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,040
source events and that's one of the main

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
things because it

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640
reduces the load on the monitoring

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
on the monitor i would say

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
what did you want to get from this

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
algorithm we wanted this algorithm to

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
support

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
and operate with

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,400
as many sensors as possible not the

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
compatibility wise but

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,799
functionality wise

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
and it doesn't really matter whether it

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,879
uses statistics or signatures or

95
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
anything else just an algorithm

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
which is very easy to scale up

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
or scale down

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
ideally

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,319
it would be nice that the algorithm just

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
does not simply notice it

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,239
it should correlate

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,959
by time

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
by plays

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,319
and by tactics

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,480
what's more important

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
is that

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,040
this algorithm works without

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
any specific

109
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,519
settings

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
so the operator would not think about

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
the topology

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,440
or toy with any ip addresses so it

113
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,199
should be a box solution just

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
out of the box solution

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,199
it should

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,240
generate the so possible kill chains

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
to analyze and understand the reason

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
behind it and last but not the least

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
it should differ to

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
concurrent but different attacks

121
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,960
this method does not replace other ones

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
but it adds more

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,600
to them

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,919
a bit of a slide here

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,160
that's quite familiar

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
and since

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
our companies

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,320
have already used this my tree matrix we

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
can use it we can use this my tree

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,440
enterprise matrix with 14 tactics and

131
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
some of the tactics

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
are more local that are

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,880
running on host some other tactics

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
are network

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,039
related tactics and the

136
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,000
ones circled in blue they are important

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
for the algorithm because

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
to a major extent their network once and

139
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
on the other hand they either

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
get to the horizontal migration or data

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
theft

142
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,520
or some other serious aggravated results

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,639
and they

144
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,280
are important for correlation

145
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
and for the automatic

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
launch of the algorithm and one last

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
text

148
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
slide

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,639
the first

150
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
definition is network group

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,919
with a set of hosts there may be just

152
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,440
one host in the group and maybe a

153
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
hundred

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,039
they are identified by ip address

155
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
or some kind of id and doesn't really

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,280
matter which one that would be for the

157
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,479
algorithm

158
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,800
possible kill chain

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
that's what we have at the output

160
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,400
having events correlated by time

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
distributed by different tactics and

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
having proper

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
time features and

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,759
here we have a few conditions

165
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,520
to be met

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
the composition of the message from this

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
sensor it should include all these

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,199
things at the time of the initiation the

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
place of the initiation

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
desirably there should be tactics id of

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,560
the sensor and the one final thing is

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,840
everything

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
specific

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
for the sensor

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,960
how does it all work

176
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,960
let's first talk about the correlation

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
by plays network groups there are two of

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
them dynamic and static dynamic ones

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
are created from zero and

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
admin doesn't need to do anything the

181
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,039
static ones are created by admins

182
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,000
and that's how they live before the

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,120
admin deletes them dynamic groups

184
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
have

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
a life span

186
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,599
dynamic

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,039
network groups

188
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,160
will be animated shortly on the screen

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
you'll see

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
how this simple very simple case is

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
explained there are some stages missing

192
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
from there so the initial point was just

193
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
to show how the dynamic network groups

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
are formed so imagine that we have our

195
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
corporate network on the left with three

196
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,240
hosts with a b and c used as identifiers

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
ids

198
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
ip addresses can stand for that and

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,680
right

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
there we have a fraudster we have

201
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,440
initial access command server and z

202
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
stands for the one

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,080
that will download the data

204
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
on the right hand side there are no

205
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
network groups

206
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,599
i mean initially

207
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,800
then

208
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
a and b sensors register some local

209
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
events for them

210
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
we have two network groups automatically

211
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
created

212
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,199
one each

213
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
one hosts one a one b and it's done

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,479
automatically

215
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,120
then the fraudster activates

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
and starts the attack

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
we don't know what happened previously

218
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
they're trying to get access

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
exploiting one of the vulnerabilities

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,399
and a network session is initiated

221
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
between the two servers

222
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,600
host a had already been there so it

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
immediately increases

224
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
the load

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
and there are two local events

226
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,839
running maybe it's a part of attack

227
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
maybe it's something independent

228
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
the host a events it does not lead to

229
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,200
the creation of network groups

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
it's added with index 1 and for host c

231
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
we have a new network group created

232
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
because there was a an event running on

233
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
it so we have three network groups

234
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,920
that you can see here on the slide host

235
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,920
a starts interacting with the command

236
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
server it's registered by a sensor

237
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
and it gets the y in the list of the

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,519
hosts

239
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
there's the horizontal shift this

240
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,560
horizontal shift relates

241
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
to the network

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
group starts uh inflating and growing

243
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,360
and group

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,839
b remains the same because there are no

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
events related to it

246
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,560
yet there is again interaction with the

247
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
command server which does not create

248
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
change the network group one because

249
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,560
there are all hosts

250
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
uh used there there is another

251
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,160
horizontal shift

252
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
there should be discovery et cetera et

253
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,800
cetera but that's not the point and

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,600
the sea host gets to this group

255
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
and the events

256
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
that we used to have in the

257
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
network group c are added

258
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
to the network group

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,800
with index one

260
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,079
initial

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,200
initial tree starts

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
getting added

263
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
the

264
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
hosts

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
to which we migrate it's a false

266
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,839
event

267
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,279
it does not create

268
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
the change of the network group it just

269
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,959
adds the events there

270
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
and one final stage of the attack

271
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,839
data theft

272
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,680
host that is added there

273
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
initially there was nothing as as you

274
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
may remember

275
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,160
the admin probably should have

276
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,839
pointed out what were they

277
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,519
um alien

278
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,079
ips and what were ours

279
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
and this tree

280
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,199
was created automatically

281
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
so the correlation by

282
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,839
plays

283
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,320
means that every event relates to that

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
network group

285
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,680
and

286
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,200
of which the host's ids belong to the

287
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
network group

288
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
now correlation by time that runs in

289
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
parallel to the one

290
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
which correlates by

291
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,120
plays there are plenty of details

292
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,279
but number one each

293
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
event has lifetime

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,880
each

295
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,959
event has the inception point

296
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
we analyzed

297
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
the apt attacks

298
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
conducted

299
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
to understand how much time each tactics

300
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,839
may take maximum amount of time and how

301
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
these tactics

302
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,760
interrelate

303
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,399
and if we know the inception of the

304
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
event the inception time of the event we

305
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
know after which time

306
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,440
the lifespan of the event

307
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
will be over

308
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,079
if the lifespan of the event is

309
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,959
big we need to store more events of such

310
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,480
kind and each possible attack also has

311
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
lifetime also have lifespan which

312
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
matches exactly with the lifespan of the

313
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,800
last event

314
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
this algorithm may detect

315
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,600
the fraudsters

316
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,040
backing up

317
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
so it requires us to

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
do additional investigation and some of

319
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
the events may prove the tactics imagine

320
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
that there is a horizontal shift

321
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,600
occurring

322
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
and two sensors have detected it a host

323
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,920
sensor and network sensor

324
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
and the signature

325
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,720
sensor says that that's an intrusion and

326
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
the other one detects an anomaly

327
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,440
it could be collection that could be a

328
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,920
horizontal shift some other thing and

329
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
such events

330
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
were very very close

331
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
by one another

332
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,519
and they relate to one host and in this

333
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,399
case there can be a confirmation the

334
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,200
less precise event tactic-wise becomes

335
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
more precise and this is how you

336
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,800
correlate events

337
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,599
by time also correlating them by place

338
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,160
now i'm going to describe the

339
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,639
correlation of events by tactics

340
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,880
it starts simply

341
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
events are grouped by tactics because

342
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,320
they are all marked and each event is

343
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
granted a weight

344
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
imagine that a signature has worked

345
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,320
and it has pointed to an execution

346
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
it gives the weight one to it it's the

347
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,160
most valid

348
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
event or some

349
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,880
abnormal sensor

350
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
informed us about an anomaly occurring

351
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,079
which points to four different tactics

352
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,880
if we divide one by four it equals 0.25

353
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
and that's the weight and these weights

354
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,160
are used to calculate the metrics

355
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
on this slide

356
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
at the same time as i speak i was trying

357
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
to show

358
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
the example of this algorithm

359
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,800
in progress i cannot of course show the

360
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,600
real data examples because it will

361
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
contain quite a lot of real data related

362
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,560
to our network i've taken this example

363
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,199
from the internet i diluted it with the

364
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,040
events i added

365
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,519
some other sensors there and i'm showing

366
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,600
here not completely because you know

367
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
there is a

368
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
lot of text but it briefly explains how

369
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,079
this algorithm

370
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,600
was

371
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
used here

372
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
for this particular attack

373
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,639
the algorithm reveals this

374
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,519
information for each particular tactics

375
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,040
by weights and how many events are there

376
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
how many events would which are given

377
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,000
weight one

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,399
how many returns

379
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
did the fraudster commit what's the

380
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
average weight

381
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,079
how many hosts were used in these

382
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,040
possible attacks what tactics have been

383
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
used

384
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,959
what was the time of the inception

385
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
what was the time

386
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
of the end

387
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,920
and that's what

388
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
we can have here there are 14 altogether

389
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
and in the end we will generate you the

390
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
criticality level

391
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,560
it's

392
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,519
five here it means that

393
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,199
there are five tactics in this

394
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,920
particular attack with weight one it's

395
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,560
not the only criticality level

396
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
there's also the one

397
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,000
considering the senior tactics

398
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
it could be a false it could be

399
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,240
something else

400
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,199
probably that's the correlation

401
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,800
so everything which i said

402
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
is not going to work if we don't get rid

403
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
of the noise

404
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,190
because you won't be able to

405
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,320
[Music]

406
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,800
go through all those printouts and the

407
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
operator is very likely to ignore it

408
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
what are the ways to

409
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
get rid of the

410
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,800
false positives well we can of course

411
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,639
use it in different

412
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
parts of algorithms

413
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
we can filter these events

414
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,399
and the very simple filtration rule is

415
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,360
for each particular event we single out

416
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,880
a set of unique fields see how very

417
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,480
frequently it

418
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
springs up and

419
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,560
we just nip these events in the bud

420
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,839
without using correlation

421
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
ml can also be applied here which we

422
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,640
didn't use because such events were

423
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,599
simple

424
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
but ml could possibly be used here and

425
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
also inside this algorithm you can

426
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,119
aggregate

427
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,640
the events

428
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
equal events

429
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,079
can be counted by a counter and we

430
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,039
should not

431
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,679
store them all it will help us

432
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,240
save the resources not getting rid of

433
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,840
them

434
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,640
and

435
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
what we do after the correlation

436
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,240
algorithm is the filtration of the

437
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
attacks for example what kind of

438
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
criteria are used here we select the

439
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
attacks that have more than two internal

440
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,880
hosts so for example there is some

441
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
horizontal shift occurring

442
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,960
and the criticality level exceeds two so

443
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
more than two tactics should be

444
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
represented here

445
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
and

446
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
initial access is there that's the

447
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,559
senior tactics one of the first tests we

448
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,919
conducted was taking 300 000 events out

449
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,720
of which there were 19 possible attacks

450
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,240
and the monitoring operator can easily

451
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
manually look through these 19. it's not

452
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
a lot we also tried at that particular

453
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,679
phase to use

454
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,840
ml also convolutional auto coding

455
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,880
we thought it would be useful

456
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
because each

457
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,520
attack is a set of events and

458
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
each event could be a vector

459
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,919
and we turn the attack into metrics

460
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,400
and we put it into the convolutional

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
autocoder which detects a norm and

462
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
anomaly a norm and anomaly but the

463
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,440
attacks are growing in

464
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,120
size so

465
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
they'll be getting bigger and bigger we

466
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
decided therefore not to use it but all

467
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
together it will give you a very

468
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
adequate result which can be used

469
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,080
to get additional high level signal to

470
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,039
detect

471
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,360
apt attacks

472
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
thank you very much

473
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,918
do you have any questions

474
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
thank you for your presentation what are

475
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,799
the means

476
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,400
of correlation

477
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
that you use

478
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,039
correlation

479
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,840
means by

480
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,080
i'm talking about the source

481
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
of the attack and target

482
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
the source is the host of the fraudster

483
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
by time also by tactic

484
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,559
and if we're talking about the

485
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,200
correlation means it's just a code

486
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
which pulls out data from the event and

487
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
correlates it if i understand that

488
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
question right yes you did

489
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
so basically it's the rule

490
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,120
no ml is used there

491
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
thank you for your presentation just a

492
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,799
couple of questions i have

493
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,520
we

494
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
filter the noise

495
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,679
so what if we just filter them in the

496
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,120
wrong way

497
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,159
and

498
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,120
we miss the attack are there any more

499
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,000
precise ways to filter it

500
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,080
well expert

501
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,720
experience is required here

502
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
so there is a danger of using ml because

503
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
in different networks the situation may

504
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
be different and we may

505
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
skip something so expert experience is

506
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,200
needed here

507
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,840
so we're talking about apt attack which

508
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,799
may last for a long time what we

509
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,280
what if we deploy this system after our

510
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,600
system has already been attacked we will

511
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,840
will we be missing the attacks

512
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,600
consider them as noise

513
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
it really all depends

514
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
where they're going to feed retro data

515
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,679
there to the algorithm but if this

516
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,760
algorithm starts working from now it

517
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
will be

518
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,480
catching the events from this moment on

519
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
okay thank you very much

520
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,480
could you pass the mic to that speaker

521
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,840
thank you very much

522
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
for your presentation

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,240
i have a question regarding this time

524
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,799
correlation uh you were showing this com

525
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,480
comparison

526
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,919
comparison

527
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,320
you're showing the correlation inside

528
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,120
the attacks between different tactics

529
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
and i have a question what would be the

530
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
advantage of using this

531
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
correlation mechanism in this particular

532
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,640
case

533
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,080
if you also have a chance to

534
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
use any

535
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,760
erp system with automation without using

536
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
the correlation mechanism

537
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,158
and as i see it we can

538
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
make it much easier for the correlation

539
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,480
means i just would like to understand

540
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
the advantages of this particular

541
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,039
approach

542
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,880
i think the advantage of this particular

543
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,799
approach is simplicity and

544
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,120
predictability

545
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,240
because this inflow of events

546
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,360
in the network is a very

547
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,840
complicated uh

548
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
event so the simplicity of the algorithm

549
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
is key here

550
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
i understand but i understand the

551
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,039
advantages in terms of the

552
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
this correlation

553
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
engine

554
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,320
that's the point

555
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
of my question

556
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,440
this algorithm

557
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,039
was

558
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,400
was developed to address those tasks

559
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
which

560
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,799
we were facing

561
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,080
as for the advantages uh let's maybe

562
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,799
discuss it later on what we can compare

563
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
it with

564
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,799
but here we don't have any claims about

565
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,320
this universal approach or

566
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
new solution we were just trying to

567
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
tackle the tasks we had to tackle

568
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,678
thank you very much
