00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,720
i am known for discovering a bunch of

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
zero dice and

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
i do have a bunch of publications as

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,038

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
digital forensics incident response

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
so i do digital forensics

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,480
incidence response

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
like i provide

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,600
you know expert guidance

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
to course for example on digital matters

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,879
social reverse engineering and malware

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
analysis

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,879
that is you know we study the functional

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,879
capabilities of malicious code

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,879
you know we do have conferences and i

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,760
speak at this conferences and i love

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,320
talking about you know some of the

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,280
you know interesting or unusual attacks

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
and techniques and practices until this

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,720
day

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
after that day

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
a lot of things changed

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
well that was the morning over the 24th

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
of february you know we got

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
many of our employees were called

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,159
with this information that we should be

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,159
expecting a spike in incidents

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
sent to people

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
and we need two people because you know

38
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
a single person you know may fail to

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
notice something

40
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,079
and then you know a single expert can

41
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,479
get something wrong

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
so you know at five o'clock

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
usually we have two people sitting red

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
eyed and they're talking about what they

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
see do you see what i see yeah i don't

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,280
think

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
you know contrasted just you know the

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
same person doing it only

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
one

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,879
and

51
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,120
then we decided that okay we also need

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,959
like the third shift like you know if we

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
run out of people that's me actually you

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
know i'm in the last

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
tier of defense and if five laughs and

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
we got another call done

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,319
what

58
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
we're sorry

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
there are other companies please talk to

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
them

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
can you imagine what it's like for us as

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
well so we've brought out of everything

63
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,200
you know blockers and hard drives

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
and we run out of

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
space

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
for

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
storage of whatever we type as we

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,879
investigate an incident server is what

69
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
drives them what have you

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,239
like we physically run out of this space

71
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,280
it was almost funny

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,519
so i come in i put my laptop on the

73
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,680
surface

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,519
they they shout uh from diagram like

75
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,200
what's the next uh laptop for

76
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
inspections he grabs my macbook and he's

77
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
carrying it there

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
say what's that bad

79
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,840
so if we're talking about uh you

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,239
know numbers well you can check our

81
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
statistics

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
so we have ksn conspiracy security

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
kaspersky i'm sorry security network

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
which collects information across all

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
our products so if there is an av for

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,840
example running on your machine which

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
has detected something okay well it will

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,319
get in touch with us you know identify

89
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,519
such and such malware such and such

90
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,360
checks

91
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
same is true for who calls

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,479
you know the system will actually detect

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,520
it as fraudulent and unfraudulent

94
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,280
the official name is who calls

95
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
kwc

96
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,960
whoever

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
broke out laughing at this joke is no

98
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
longer my friend okay

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
but you know this chart obviously shows

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,759
that died

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
you know in some countries you know on

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
the 24th of february there was not a

103
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,639
single fraudulent phone call on that day

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
well naturally you know everything is

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
back to normal and we are saying this

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
roller coaster right actually it's not

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
really back to

108
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,520
early february levels

109
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
what's the reason for that

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,639
well many people have been talking about

111
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
it and many people have been

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
wondering or are guessing it

113
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
but

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
it was only on the 15th of april

115
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,639
one in the russian federation

116
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,320
they had a show

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,639
where they showed a call center

118
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
in bergdansk

119
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,120
where this fraudulent colors

120
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
we can actually guess you know what it's

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,280
all about when we see a similar dip in

122
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,599
other charts

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
so this is our search engine

124
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
scouring the dark web like everybody

125
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
knows at a dark web you know you need to

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
register there's some moderation you

127
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
improve your reputation there

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,960
is

129
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
of banks and

130
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,280
dumping of cards

131
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
the number of adverts on that time

132
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,639
the one

133
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
i'm certainly no i'm talking about

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
jobs

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
there is a spike and then it goes down

136
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,520
and naturally

137
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,759
now it's close to zero because russian

138
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,199
cards

139
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
are no longer stable currency

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
are no

141
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
and yes obviously we are talking about

142
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,800
millions of detections

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,759
so we've got our statistics

144
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
which should actually help us see you

145
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
know which country is safe online

146
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,360
like if you ask yourself like what's the

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,039
probability you'll find a virus online

148
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,599
in a given year like 15 years ago if

149
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
you're in russia

150
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,400
the probability would be 75 percent

151
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,440
there was no chance like

152
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
you know you wouldn't see this uh red

153
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
window of your av

154
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
10 years later

155
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
so this chart is as of late 2021

156
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,759
your chances are like 15

157
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,319
it's not even 50.50

158
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
which

159
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
seems to be going down or it has been

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,039
going down or had it had

161
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
like this is the freshest you can do

162
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
like i made this presentation this

163
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,039
morning

164
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,599
and now this chance is 33 percent

165
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,760
and around russia it's like close to 50

166
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
percent

167
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,519
so i can tell you by the end of the year

168
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
it will be at least that now we all know

169
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
what false positives are

170
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,760
we do hope

171
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
there were lots of false positives as we

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,839
compiled this map that's why we're only

173
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
going to release our official date at

174
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,279
the end of the year

175
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,399
however

176
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
they we do see that the number of av

177
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,320
alerts has certainly gone up

178
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,480
now if we

179
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
take a look at the evolution of

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
detections day after day

181
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
this will look like this

182
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
this is global

183
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
and probably won't be able to see that

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
very day

185
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,240
and this is same for russia

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
you will see this job right

187
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
now

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
and just like you know we saw with a

189
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
phone fraud

190
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
you know there was a fall and there was

191
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,080
a spike we can actually

192
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
you know the people who no longer could

193
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
uh buy their own business their usual

194
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
business

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
you know there are some charts that have

196
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,079
gone up obviously you know ddos has been

197
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,600
on the rise

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
now all those who have been responding

199
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
to ddos

200
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
you know

201
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
they've been pretty busy these days

202
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,560
what has also gone up

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,519
his backdoors propagating via email

204
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
so attachments or links

205
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
you get in email you know taking you to

206
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
mattresses or word documents or whatever

207
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
so the number of such attachments

208
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,959
has certainly gone up

209
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,920
okay

210
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
they got initial access you know it

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
takes just a single morning to open the

212
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
letter like this

213
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
what's next

214
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,640
next is encryption

215
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
now if you build a trend line here you

216
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
will see there was a bit of a drop there

217
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,040
but now we see peaks happening later

218
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,959
it's really interesting you know where

219
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,720
this speaks up like we do remember the

220
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
russian gardens so this big like russian

221
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
cars nobody needs them right

222
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
so

223
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
the russians absolutely need to put

224
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
their money in

225
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
encrypt yourself done you know what they

226
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
did but interestingly enough they did

227
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
not demand money

228
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
altruistic

229
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,120
altruist you think

230
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
now if you do the trend line you will

231
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,600
see that it's rising here

232
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,959
okay you must have brought those

233
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,839
releases from us about uh back doors and

234
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
remote access tools number of cyber

235
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
incidents and russian companies have has

236
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,720
quadrupled

237
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,880
we are talking here about sophisticated

238
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
incidents this is you know for us you

239
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
know sophisticated incident is when your

240
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,399
domain controller gets hijacked

241
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,800
the number of cases the number of calls

242
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,959
you

243
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
you know where we don't really know what

244
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,760
to do and like the case seems to be

245
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,079
totally causes loss and i'm not even

246
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
sure i'm talking to the customer you

247
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
know

248
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,279
it has certainly gone up let me tell you

249
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,320
this story about ddos

250
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
24th of february and ddos attacks

251
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
started right away

252
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
the industry noticed them

253
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,360
and all of them were flawed

254
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,959
it was interesting and maybe funny

255
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,279
so everybody started doing guip

256
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,720
filtration

257
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
which means that now you can no longer

258
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
pay

259
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
with your mirror card over a vpn and you

260
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,000
will not be able to enter

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
a gosu

262
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
if you're using vpn and this has

263
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
triggered all this memes about having to

264
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
switch your vpn off all the time

265
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
so if we see a european ide and i will

266
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
block it

267
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,800
next we start experiencing l7 ddos

268
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
attacks this was more fun the number of

269
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
bots you need in order to down a site at

270
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
the l3 level

271
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,399
you need like hundreds of thousands

272
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
maybe millions

273
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,839
but for l7

274
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,279
it's different

275
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,839
because for l7

276
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,279
10 000 bots

277
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,000
would be okay

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
so you find an api on the website

279
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
and you're down the whole site by

280
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
overloading this api what's funny about

281
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
it

282
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,279
is that

283
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
like we do know that you know

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
you know some totally relevant apis will

285
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
not be allowed but you can use proxies

286
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
and some proxies in their headers

287
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
contain information on who's using them

288
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
this is where it gets funny

289
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
you must have heard about attribution

290
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
before

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
so we have a ddos attack

292
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,560
and this means we have logs

293
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
in logs we have x headers which show the

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
proxy

295
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,959
and

296
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
and well it actually shows the user who

297
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
asks the proxy to forward his packet

298
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,399
and it contains the url of whoever is

299
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
behind the proxy

300
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
so i started googling it

301
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,720
and i

302
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
find github

303
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
i grab the link to github

304
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,680
and i find a telegram channel

305
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
we're 10 000 people on this particular

306
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
telegram channel

307
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,240
they've all got avatars

308
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,959
you can read things about them

309
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,199
and on github people also have accounts

310
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,959
and they've got avatars

311
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
and you know you can read this telegram

312
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
channel and we'll see what's not

313
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,959
guys

314
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,439
use this

315
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,440
indicate this proxy and let's attack

316
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
like if you're asked who is devosting us

317
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,959
and you tell us well here is the

318
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,279
telegram group arrest all the 10 000.

319
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
you know people who do that

320
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,079
you know they are undoubtable

321
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
now technically speaking

322
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
what has been interesting since that

323
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
time

324
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
i should probably tell you a particular

325
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
case right

326
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
a telegram channel of this kind it's

327
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,040
it's official actually

328
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
you can browse it see the targets

329
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,519
and compare the number of bots you

330
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,480
actually

331
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
saw on your perimeter and compare it to

332
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
the size of uh you know this group it's

333
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,000
like one to ten

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
in this telegram channel there will be a

335
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
lot of

336
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,959
and this actually got in our way

337
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,399
and people responsible for you know

338
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,199
security at a given company

339
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,360
is uh being called and then you know we

340
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,079
need to actually double check if indeed

341
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
you know this dump really happened and

342
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
which particular database was leaked

343
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,758
so previously

344
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,519
when you know total would be

345
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,839
presented there as a dump

346
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,360
you know you come to the company and it

347
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
turns out that the company doesn't have

348
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
service like this doesn't have databases

349
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
like this

350
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,919
there's no clear like you don't have any

351
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
clue why you actually came

352
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
the number of this fake

353
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
it's not a fake calls but they have fake

354
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
leaks

355
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,480
has grown

356
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,559
significantly

357
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,319
so if you trust these guys you know

358
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,280
kaspersky labs has had a source code

359
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,160
stolen twice already

360
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
wait a little bit we are going to upload

361
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,559
the dump and we're going to see how the

362
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,039
source code of kaspersky lives

363
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,440
they are using you know source code of

364
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
clover

365
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
so

366
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,919
this actually can be done very easily

367
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,760
with vget minus r command

368
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
and then on twitter you can read it if

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
you're interested

370
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
there are photos of clowns

371
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
like what the heck are you doing like

372
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
are you serious do you remember this

373
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,440
case

374
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
of a ddos attack against burger king

375
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,320
like uh kids quiet down and go do your

376
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
homework

377
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,840
now the problem with this kids

378
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
is that you know as a security service

379
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,440
provider i still need to react

380
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
like i'm told go check the logs

381
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
you know when they say the same like for

382
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
the second time

383
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,039
we didn't even check the logs you know

384
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,679
the second time

385
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,639
it says includes copyright kaspersky

386
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
so inside the archive you know they

387
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,039
removed the timestamps of the files

388
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,039
and they presented it as a new leak

389
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
should i react

390
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,440
because you know from the legal

391
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
perspective

392
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,200
all this stuff is against the law

393
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
however the case of this iit army is

394
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,840
like

395
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,200
this now there is this thing called

396
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,919
foreign legend

397
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
so for example you know a citizen of

398
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
some country you know can arrive in this

399
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,960
continent and go kill people

400
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,080
and that will be legal

401
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,679
so if you're a citizen some other

402
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
country and you want to join the iit

403
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,678
army

404
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,799
like is that legal

405
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,960
not

406
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
like with arms it's okay we're used to

407
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
having foreign but you know with cyber

408
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
arms not so clear

409
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
that's why people started talking about

410
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
legalizing it all

411
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,039
like last prohibited extradition of

412
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,400
people for cyber crime

413
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,520
telegram channel you know people got

414
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
avatars their photos their phone numbers

415
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
and after they do all this

416
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
they won't have to pay

417
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,520
incidents

418
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
you know the incidents that started on

419
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,039
the 24th of february they were like that

420
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,240
the network is down

421
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,640
nothing is working

422
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
because the virtual machines are still

423
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,720
there on the hard drives

424
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
you can find this stuff in the bash

425
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
history

426
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,640
so you can check the deletion date

427
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
and in most cases

428
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
you can see the roots

429
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,440
and an ip associated with kievster uh

430
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
several days later and obviously that's

431
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
not a standalone that's not a single

432
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
listen

433
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,880
so several days later

434
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
they

435
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,760
you know we're very simple scripts

436
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
that's what's in uh

437
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,880
that would write the right parameters

438
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
into shr config and then you know the

439
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,440
root user would be able to do whatever

440
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,600
they liked

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
the people who wiped it they decided

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
well how about we do our sync before we

443
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
wipe it well isn't that logical right

444
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
i mean

445
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,600
we are killing everything aren't we

446
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,320
so they started doing rsync

447
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,799
and large companies databases which are

448
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,840
serving huge

449
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,080
clientele you know they've got databases

450
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,240
measured in petabytes are thinking

451
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
petabytes

452
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,679
will take forever that's why they were

453
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,120
doing rsync for backups

454
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,120
they upload it to their telegram channel

455
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,559
then they delete everything

456
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,120
you take the same back up

457
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,420
and you install it back

458
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,040
[Music]

459
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,600
[Laughter]

460
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,360
so we have the logs

461
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,400
we got the security log

462
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,919
system

463
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
we see the changes in the file system

464
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,840
we do the investigation

465
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
you know they could have done it over a

466
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
gprs a tour or vpn it's not required

467
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
because you know

468
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
like unfettered they they know they

469
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,120
won't be persecuted i said most of the

470
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,719
dumps are fakes but some are real

471
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,440
this is where this whole search for the

472
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
perpetrator is over like attribution

473
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,919
is very serious but do not underestimate

474
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,440
ukraine's volunteer hackers

475
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,559
you know in the first days when they

476
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
would wipe and r sink everything

477
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
they apparently run into a problem they

478
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
lost their access rights you know they

479
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,919
had used all the

480
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,720
everything they had

481
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,440
and then you know they started this

482
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,320
campaign

483
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
on telegram where they would tell people

484
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
we will pay you 2 000 euros

485
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
for launching this exam file wherever

486
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,158
you are like at work

487
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
early 2201

488
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,320
there was nothing interesting nothing

489
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,640
novel about those uh

490
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
particular cases like if you are

491
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
concerned about supply chain attacks

492
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,880
don't be it was very simplistic

493
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,400
it was very effective it was very

494
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,760
painful particularly given that

495
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,240
everything got white

496
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,880
but they exhausted the airport that's

497
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
why they started their mass

498
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
mailing campaigns

499
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,679
several weeks after the 24th of february

500
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,080
is the first steeler he got detected by

501
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,400
everybody

502
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,480
it's a binary

503
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,000
on a different geysers it was promoted

504
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,080
so some people would put it in the

505
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,320
attachment it's a large one actually

506
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
others

507
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,400
you know

508
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
would

509
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,200
try to pull it up as a macros for axel

510
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
second one was dark crystal very similar

511
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
in fact to red line

512
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,760
and interestingly it can be managed via

513
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
telegram as well

514
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,640
it has lots of functions such as

515
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
stealing crypto wallets

516
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
is that he was actually

517
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,799
promoted as a federal anti-virus

518
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,799
you know when it was released we did not

519
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,039
have a sample

520
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,200
like the news was there but you know we

521
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,679
didn't have an md5 for it we started

522
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,919
looking at our database

523
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,600
you know we got a letter saying well

524
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,399
install the federal anti-virus

525
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,159
like we're thinking it would be called

526
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,640
federal antivirus

527
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,240
it was called

528
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
federal atti 80 virus without the end

529
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
now we couldn't find it yes they they

530
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,159
did it on purpose so that's you know

531
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,919
we couldn't protect against it

532
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,360
so they would uh

533
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,440
use targeted orders like spear phishing

534
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,640
campaigns

535
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,080
and all the links would lead to a cloud

536
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
and uh

537
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
you do remember a guip

538
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
protection is in place

539
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,279
that's why this uh cloud

540
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,520
was in the russian territory and yes it

541
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,840
did have the exit file in it

542
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,480
okay so this letter got sent some people

543
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
did

544
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
now the previous presentation

545
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,159
told you nasty things not bacons are

546
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,399
about

547
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,640
now there is public key in the conflict

548
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
of bacon

549
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,360
and you can use this public key

550
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
in order to identify who owns the

551
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,159
license

552
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,679
in all these cases this public key

553
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,799
is you know a pirated chinese beacon i'm

554
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,840
not even going to tell you the version

555
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,279
on how to hide beacon cncs

556
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
and for example you can use public

557
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,439
services

558
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,559
for example you have a web server you

559
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,120
connect it

560
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
and then in the hostname

561
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,360
you actually indicated your desired

562
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,559
pulse

563
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
so all these beacons were effectively

564
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,200
built on asia

565
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
connections to the initial

566
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,440
apis

567
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,919
were quite different

568
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,159
either is chinese bacon going to

569
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,440
cucumber

570
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,679
or the other victim

571
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,640
oh you know what uh

572
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
is

573
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,720
mimi cats and lateral movement

574
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,679
nothing really special

575
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
i initially told you

576
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
that the first

577
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,279
you know road connectors or

578
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
ssr spiral kits

579
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,279
now for linux infrastructure they did

580
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,559
yes

581
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,279
they started installing rootkits

582
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,760
and we saw several types of

583
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,000
some were simply downloaded after github

584
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,360
but others

585
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,640
were effectively recalculations of ltso

586
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
so it's a dynamic library

587
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,399
which can inject any lip

588
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,039
in any process

589
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
and this way you should be able to hide

590
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,120
from netstats

591
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,480
and others

592
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,039
to remain unseen

593
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,159
so if they do get inside now this is how

594
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,480
they did it

595
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,919
and i guess the funniest bit is about

596
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,559
node.js

597
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,159
everybody knows what node.js is right

598
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,120
isn't that um no js is a bastard if

599
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,240
you ask me

600
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,600
so

601
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,519
we got exposed states in 2020 2021 and

602
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,760
all the incidents around now just back

603
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,519
down

604
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,279
we're like serious

605
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,519
real-life incidents

606
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,120
and notes js this interpreter 60

607
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,519
megabytes long you know

608
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
you know would be registered as a

609
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,039
service so

610
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,919
if they wanted to you know persist owner

611
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,919
on a host you know they would install it

612
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,159
and they would for example create a

613
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
schedule a task in nine months so to

614
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,440
speak

615
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,679
so it started

616
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,000
and there is huge reliability as regards

617
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,840
what node.js will do

618
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,039
now what we are seeing right now is that

619
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,600
node.js is effectively a matriarchal

620
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,120
stacking door

621
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,440
because node.js will start

622
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,000
and it can start as a service or as a

623
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,279
task

624
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,640
or

625
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,919
it's come from a macros

626
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,240
some javascript

627
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,080
there will be an url

628
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,158
to javascript it's obfuscated

629
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,519
you need to go through at least three

630
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,039
hops until you get your shell

631
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
a shell or no js

632
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,320
that's perverse

633
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
however going through all these hops

634
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,919
and doing it quickly is pretty difficult

635
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,919
so if this incident happened fast

636
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
well it certainly gets noticed right

637
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,840
you know and these hops are a still life

638
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
well then you know if you go there

639
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,799
quickly

640
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,799
you can restore the system

641
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,559
you know if they sat on their arms

642
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,159
they'll sit on their hands several weeks

643
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,799
not anymore

644
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,960
but you know if you only see that you

645
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,039
know this interpreter you know was

646
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,240
launched but you don't really know what

647
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
it dated what it downloaded too bad for

648
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,159
you

649
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,039
they launched the show

650
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,679
yes

651
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,640
a reflective loader or node.js

652
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,760
you know from that moment on you can

653
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,159
actually start downloading xz files like

654
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,879
mini cuts but no

655
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,839
why

656
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,239
that would be too simple right

657
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,560
we want it all to be running ojs and you

658
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,918
know to be running in memory all the

659
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,078
time

660
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,239
so my conclusions are like this

661
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,800
all the incidents after

662
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,599
the 24th of february are in fact old

663
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,639
incidents

664
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,440
like old excesses

665
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
now if you actually check out the

666
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,239
telegram channels for these leaks

667
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
you will see that although they're

668
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,440
advertising it as a recent leak the sql

669
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,879
dump will contain data

670
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,800
going back to 2021 because you know

671
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,839
it's backup data

672
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,400
how do they get access to these backups

673
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,640
through old excesses so to speak and

674
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
they use java vulnerabilities and

675
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,920
exchange vulnerabilities

676
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,240
now if you're afraid that they were

677
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,040
abt's or zero dies or supply chain

678
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
attacks or ufi attacks

679
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
forget it

680
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,320
it was a run-of-the-mill stuff

681
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,560
even when they were wiping it it was so

682
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,960
simple they either did it through rdp or

683
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,079
ssh um

684
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,599
in this country

685
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,000
there is not a single company left that

686
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
would not react to the senses i wonder

687
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,680
why

688
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
you know they lost

689
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,640
all the hopes they had that's why they

690
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
you know

691
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,599
redoubled uh their fishing campaigns

692
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,079
you know and you know they are creative

693
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,720
at times but not very productive i think

694
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,399
you know node.js i've heard github

695
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,280
it's standardized malware all this stuff

696
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,160
is easy to catch with forensics

697
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,839
is relatively easy to detect

698
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,280
now if they clean the logs up

699
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,160
this doesn't really thwarts uh forensics

700
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,800
if you check bash history

701
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
you know if you see people are ramming

702
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,079
warlocks

703
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,920
take my word for it restoring them is

704
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,800
not that difficult

705
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,160
so my conclusion

706
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,560
for example you know the dip in uh phone

707
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,680
fraud

708
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
pretty easy to explain but what about

709
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,839
the spike

710
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,760
how come

711
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,160
several months later

712
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,800
you know it all rebounds i don't really

713
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,119
know

714
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,839
do you remember this uh very like

715
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,400
volatile

716
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,599
charts you know i think that you know

717
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,520
mathematically speaking you know you

718
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,160
know this oscillation should die down in

719
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,040
the next several months

720
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,480
enough emotions

721
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,839
you know when they did wipes they

722
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,240
finally realized okay maybe are a

723
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,599
sink now what about

724
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,599
kids and maybe not just the rules kids

725
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,160
but maybe we should also delete the logs

726
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,480
so we are seeing evolution and pretty

727
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
rapid evolution

728
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,040
as well with this kind of evolution

729
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,720
where will they be several months down

730
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,599
the road

731
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,760
let's wait and see

732
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,720
but again take my word for it at the

733
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,440
moment we are not seeing anything out of

734
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,680
the order

735
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,160
now in my presentations at phd i usually

736
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,560
use memes not this time

737
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,880
or shall i

738
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,839
present

739
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,359
i should probably finish with a meme

740
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,400
right

741
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,550
to end my presentation

742
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,839
[Applause]

743
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,800
uh

744
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
attack

745
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,160
now i promise to give two t-shirts to

746
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,920
people who ask the best questions i see

747
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,359
two hands

748
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,960
this must be

749
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,560
people who really want the t-shirts

750
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
thanks i'm uh

751
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,960
i have two questions

752
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
you know negative uh

753
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,320
and

754
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
they were in fact i'm wondering if there

755
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,680
were incidents related to node.js no

756
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,720
but teamviewer has left

757
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,680
can have tv in place or you can install

758
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,240
it while it's no longer available you

759
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,400
know then you're using any desk and it's

760
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,359
uh used both by admins and hackers

761
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,839
in this respect nothing has changed

762
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,280
off my question

763
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
you mean r80

764
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,320
something about the payload

765
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,280
you mean the icon like which can be

766
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,079
hidden or not

767
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,480
you can patch him here

768
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,200
or not

769
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,319
who will notice a new folder in program

770
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,560
files if you are managing a fleet of 20

771
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
000 computers

772
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,400
right and you don't really need a patch

773
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,640
for that

774
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,079
so you mentioned the number of attacks

775
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,920
and he also showed the map

776
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,400
has gone up

777
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
the companies that you know previously

778
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,200
didn't use your services

779
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,680
you know they just ran straight here

780
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,160
you know scanned everything and reported

781
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,480
to ksn it's a possibility yes

782
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,720
you know i'll try to be very careful in

783
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
my comment here

784
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,560
you know this map

785
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,839
covers a relatively short period of time

786
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,000
if you study it in detail you will

787
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
discover some very weird users

788
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,920
now there is this person

789
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,319
who took for example are free to use

790
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,839
free-to-use version of our as

791
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,160
and you know like five bacons are

792
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,480
detected beacon six is not detected

793
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,440
and

794
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,640
well i would you know calculate them all

795
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,280
so interpreting this data may be maybe

796
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,599
tricky

797
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,040
well in any case last year we saw

798
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
nothing like this

799
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,200
like i wonder what it is why people

800
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,118
would install avs like crazy

801
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,880
jesus freaking christ

802
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,640
well isn't ddos attacking now people not

803
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,960
infrastructure are you journalists

804
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,079
aren't you

805
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,760
you can certainly say that you know

806
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,280
we've got freedom of speech you can say

807
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,839
whatever you like

808
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,000
and people who

809
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
do you know ddos defense you know and

810
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
that's not my line of work you know i'm

811
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,839
reading logs

812
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,800
so the i.t people you know they wouldn't

813
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,119
sleep

814
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,680
i think there was an article on reuters

815
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,560
when the americans woke up

816
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,440
so the article said that the russia

817
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,839
you know has raised its cyber shield

818
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,640
like this is our g-o-i-b system being

819
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,960
switched on if it's in a warrant's

820
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,560
events the name of a cyber shield than

821
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,440
it is

822
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,119
well i can tell you that you know some

823
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,960
people have not been sleeping much or

824
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
we're not studying much

825
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,839
you know it was not like an l

826
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,000
kind of attack no

827
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
i mean

828
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,160
nothing out of the blue

829
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,880
so this cyber was it cyber shield or

830
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,359
cyber because

831
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,630
 is russian for shield

832
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,920
[Music]

833
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,280
take the microwave from the gentleman

834
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,400
have you seen incidents

835
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,359
related to admins getting panicky

836
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,839
so maybe you know they were trying to

837
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,400
get things right and in the process they

838
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,960
would you know break everything

839
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,920
like

840
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
you know we saw cases where people would

841
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,599
you know do rm slash rf and uh be in

842
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,839
trouble

843
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,520
well we had one incident

844
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,560
involving proactive employees

845
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,960
so there was

846
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,599
so there is a there is a host with

847
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,760
but it has no locks we cannot really see

848
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,920
who get connected to it

849
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,800
so what do we do tcp dump

850
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,839
it

851
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,440
now whoever gets connected

852
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,560
and

853
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,280
in order to minimize traffic we switch

854
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,440
it on at 3 am and we found that

855
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,680
hey i'm very ecstatic about it

856
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,520
and then we learned

857
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,920
that a proactive employee decided to

858
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,400
work at night

859
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,560
like we had the sounds of questions to

860
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
that person

861
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
and then you know we had to reschedule

862
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,000
this experiment

863
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,699
[Music]

864
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,119
started discovering and twitter telegram

865
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,839
and github

866
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,599
and maybe their phone as well

867
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,760
they started asking us

868
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,240
what should i do about it

869
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
i would tell them how about you send a

870
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,160
message to twitter and github

871
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,319
would you have any other recommendations

872
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,119
deleting data from uh twitter and github

873
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,800
like deleting data from the internet

874
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,799
need i answer this question

875
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,078
how do i delete my iep from twitter

876
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,160
no but i'm afraid this is it really

877
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,240
you know just forgive him and keep it

878
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,479
there

879
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,760
uh

880
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,319
two questions

881
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,760
how was that node.js delivered and would

882
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,599
you think that node.js is a trend now

883
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,119
for a pen testers

884
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,200
two ways of delivering

885
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,919
the first one

886
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
is that you have an xls with a macros

887
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
inside

888
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,359
and the macros

889
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,520
cmd exactly

890
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,000
which will then download the exit file

891
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,200
from the official node.js foundation.com

892
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,280
and the second one was the powershell

893
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,960
way

894
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,000
a web applet

895
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
let's say powershell would uh download

896
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,800
and install it

897
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,359
type google update

898
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,960
and file name was google update dot

899
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,280
example

900
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,440
it's a signed file it was easy to launch

901
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,599
right

902
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,599
like people previously would do that to

903
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,319
get noticed

904
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,160
at the same time you know abcs

905
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,359
or other serious people you know would

906
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,440
actually get inside the perimeter and

907
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,640
are you know persisting there

908
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,640
and just that we're not noticing them

909
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,160
because of uh you know the whole

910
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,720
hullabaloo

911
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
well is it possible that you haven't

912
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,400
spotted something you've never seen

913
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,559
before yes it's uh theoretically

914
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,960
possible

915
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,400
not a good one

916
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,839
as an expert i hate questions like is it

917
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,480
possible everything is possible and if

918
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,319
the aliens arrive tomorrow they will be

919
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,279
able to argue with me

920
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,160
but my country question is like this are

921
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,760
there signs of that

922
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,079
is it possible there is an apc it is

923
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,280
possible

924
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,599
are there a signs that there is an apc

925
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,359
we don't see

926
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,240
what could be those signs

927
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,599
for example

928
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,520
there is an incident

929
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,160
and nobody learns about it

930
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,558
no uh

931
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,880
even if it wasn't in the news you know

932
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,040
at least the cyber security community

933
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,680
knows about them

934
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,920
and i can tell you that we experience no

935
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,559
poltergeist

936
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,598
what it is

937
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,000
we never felt that you know some apt

938
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,599
embedded their payload in the uefi

939
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,359
firmware at the factory no

940
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,680
i have got so far no signs of anything

941
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,319
like this happening

942
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,680
so how do i deliver this as you know

943
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,000
great speeches and where to get myself a

944
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,280
t-shirt

945
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,960
well you should either drink more or you

946
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,319
should drink less but i don't know how

947
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,160
much you drink

948
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,079
i'm i'm afraid drinking is not the

949
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,480
answer

950
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,559
this has been the sexiest presentation

951
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,880
today

952
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,160
thank you so much dear friends

953
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,680
what about russian hackers

954
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,200
they respond to incidents there we

955
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,650
respond to incidents here

956
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,920
[Laughter]

957
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,079
have you heard that planes don't fly

958
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,000
anymore

959
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,490
yes

960
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,620
[Music]

961
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,399
a binary

962
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,119
well people are saying things on

963
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,680
telegram you know

964
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,839
you know if at first we still monitored

965
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,200
the news

966
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,520
like we felt we had to

967
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
like several weeks later

968
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,880
we couldn't care less

969
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,280
well because you know you've got

970
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,680
specific people to help and specific

971
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,440
computers to save you don't really have

972
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,839
the time to read the news or telegram

973
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,440
so i haven't been reading telegram for

974
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,760
quite some time nor am i planning to and

975
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,839
you know people writing in telegram and

976
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,520
people responding to incidents are two

977
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,240
different crowds

978
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,720
sergei

979
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,520
thank you very much for such a

980
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,599
rockstar lecture must be the most

981
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,200
interesting today i hope this

982
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,200
does not detract or insult the other

983
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,319
lecturers

984
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,280
so there was this question about

985
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,559
removing data from the internet

986
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,040
you know they always have uh

987
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,200
you know an email

988
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,800
for abuse you know i know from

989
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,720
experience

990
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,079
that you know

991
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,079
this is something to use

992
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,559
so provide the artifacts send a letter

993
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,400
if they're illegal you know if they're a

994
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,480
legit institution

995
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,000
you know the probability that they will

996
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,359
respond is actually pretty high

997
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,200
just do it

998
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
like i'm speaking from experience

999
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,520
and it will work even with for inventors

1000
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
so the question has been about the

1001
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,720
incidents related to our

1002
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,559
neighbor country

1003
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,880
and we may be assuming that lots of

1004
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,400
hacks are

1005
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,040
initiated

1006
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,520
it would be

1007
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,319
reasonable to assume shall i say that

1008
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,319
you know with this whole hullabaloo you

1009
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,680
know some

1010
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,240
more advanced threats such as ipts would

1011
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,160
also want to use it you know to

1012
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,200
promote their interests

1013
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,079
so i'm wondering if a kaspersky labs you

1014
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,760
have seen

1015
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,200
any increase in advanced activity

1016
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,119
[Music]

1017
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,160
i understand your question

1018
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,920
you know i respond to incident i don't

1019
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,760
really know who the attacker is maybe an

1020
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,160
insider or an apt or a hacker

1021
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,079
once i've answered the questions once

1022
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,640
i've done my investigation i can say you

1023
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,599
know we saw this md5 in such and such

1024
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,359
attack and it may be an apt

1025
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,440
i can't tell you what you're ordering

1026
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,079
the overall level

1027
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,799
and we find more things that can be

1028
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,240
attributed to sophisticated threats like

1029
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,760
this beacon for example well the

1030
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,359
previous speaker talked a lot of beacons

1031
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,280
i will not be able going forward

1032
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,680
you know to identify if i see a beacon

1033
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,000
if it comes from an apt or just you know

1034
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,200
an avid reader

1035
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,520
well apts they are often you know

1036
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,680
attributed on the basis of specialized

1037
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,078
software

1038
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,880
we have not discovered anything

1039
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,440
radically new in this attacks he has

1040
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,520
always been you know old

1041
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,359
it's not just you know you know and you

1042
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,880
md five you know that's weak not reverse

1043
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,960
engineers something that you know is

1044
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,280
beyond our capability nothing like that

1045
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,759
give him give me a t-shirt

1046
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,319
a philosophical question

1047
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,880
was previously considered

1048
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,839
state-sponsored organization

1049
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:58,559
how

1050
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,119
ethical

1051
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,160
that makes me think of this joke about

1052
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,839
conscription

1053
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,680
no it hasn't really changed you know

1054
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,920
now on the ransomware front for example

1055
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,680
is the only important thing like you

1056
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,720
know where

1057
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,119
one hacker became an independent

1058
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,359
researcher and he started uh publishing

1059
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,880
on twitter

1060
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,799
all the dirt on the whole group

1061
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,040
so he's got his issues

1062
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,880
and i think this is how he's uh

1063
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,079
effectively trying to

1064
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,640
keep all the dirt on russian hackers and

1065
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,720
uh got himself a decent name but

1066
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,880
globally speaking

1067
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,839
nothing has really changed

1068
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,160
those who get an incident with them they

1069
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,240
will you know get to talk about it i

1070
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,280
guess

1071
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,240
i'm on the other side

1072
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,760
i actually don't think that if this dude

1073
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,920
for example

1074
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,440
you know he you know like if he

1075
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,000
re-focused on are you

1076
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,920
does he really think that you know they

1077
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,079
will drop their churches against him for

1078
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,720
that no way

1079
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,040
what i mean is that there is rumor that

1080
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,119
when russian hackers are you know

1081
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,960
apprehended in russia after that they

1082
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,720
start working for the law enforcement

1083
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,799
agencies it's a rumor right and i don't

1084
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,640
comment on rumors is that it

1085
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,440
jesus freaking christ guys this is

1086
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,440
like 6 p.m already i hope this will be

1087
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,720
the last question

1088
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,000
thank you very much for your report

1089
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,079
so you started with figures and somehow

1090
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,599
people are mostly interested in tnts

1091
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,520
so we've been in this paradigm for this

1092
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,839
three months and very often

1093
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,680
we hear a comparison of what's happening

1094
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,520
right now to the start of the pandemic

1095
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,480
there was no job like everything started

1096
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,160
climbing in cavity time so that's it

1097
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,040
particularly on the rise during cover

1098
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,480
times was a fraud targeting individuals

1099
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
you know people are staying home you

1100
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,640
know the money is running out they start

1101
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,480
selling stuff on you know ebay's of this

1102
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,599
world

1103
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,640
and they get defrauded

1104
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,520
people are spending more time online

1105
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,200
people click

1106
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,079
links they shouldn't click and they fall

1107
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,359
you know frauds goes up

1108
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,200
but you know it's much more hectic now

1109
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,760
you know now is not the time for a petty

1110
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,079
fruit

1111
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,119
your question is slightly different it's

1112
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,119
like about psychological reaction and

1113
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,760
hysteria that's a different question

1114
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,000
like during the pandemic times when you

1115
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,079
know the lockdown rules were pretty

1116
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,280
strict

1117
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,119
like we had cases when we were not

1118
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,400
allowed

1119
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,319
to respond to an incident

1120
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,799
you know it had people

1121
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,040
who would talk to clients security

1122
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,559
people and instruct them on the phone

1123
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,520
like grab the server not this server

1124
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,920
that was horrible really

1125
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,240
but now you know it's a normal life you

1126
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,000
know we are in shifts we are responding

1127
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,520
to incidents

1128
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,799
no restriction on travel

1129
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,920
you should so i would put it like this

1130
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,400
the difference is significant

1131
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,520
you know there was this old joke

1132
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,040
this whole mask business will seem

1133
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,359
trifling

1134
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,440
i think what we're having right now is a

1135
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,240
sort of erotic virus

1136
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,359
okay two more questions that we call it

1137
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,640
today

1138
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,960
what it is i had to give away

1139
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,880
can i can i give the t-shirts right away

1140
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,359
i need a t-shirt

1141
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,839
blocking system there have been a lot of

1142
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,400
misfires so to speak and uh

1143
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,720
what about ddos attacks

1144
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,680
at dns it does make sense for us to

1145
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,799
start our role in servers

1146
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,559
the particular institution you're

1147
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,640
talking about did have issues and i

1148
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,280
think that their file zones uh

1149
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,599
you know where europe right and when uh

1150
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,040
they started taking russia out of

1151
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,440
different organizations this one problem

1152
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,599
started heaping up

1153
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,599
started

1154
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,799
attacks started

1155
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,359
wait a second

1156
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,359
so short-term issues

1157
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,799
were there rather and they were all

1158
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,599
compensated

1159
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,319
no position really to tell them how they

1160
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,799
should be working this is outside my

1161
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,759
subject matter field

1162
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,599
a question about chinese firewalls and

1163
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,359
please please do not dismiss it by

1164
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,640
talking about alcohol okay

1165
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,240
is that the same question again

1166
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,399
okay the question is

1167
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:44,309
[Music]

1168
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,680
so when we are for example detecting

1169
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,399
phone calls

1170
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,039
and if you consult my charts you know

1171
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,880
you will discover like a million phone

1172
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,440
numbers like this

1173
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,839
numbers

1174
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:31,038
and the system is not ideal as we

1175
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,799
and then a month or two later

1176
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
it became a problem because

1177
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,920
emails no longer

1178
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,799
get sent and phones no longer rings

1179
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:51,920
which means

1180
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,880
that we are actually building ourselves

1181
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,359
a dumbed-down version of the internet

1182
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,960
you know it's not that they have pulled

1183
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,280
a switch on us you know we have dumbed

1184
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,760
our internet down by blocking so many

1185
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,039
resources

1186
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,440
and again i'm in no position to talk on

1187
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,359
behalf of the state

1188
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,880
i'm only able to

1189
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,400
tell us what to expect come on go have a

1190
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,480
rest okay i'll tell you personally later

1191
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,200
this will be the last question

1192
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,920
is extremely funny isn't it

1193
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,119
you know

1194
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:53,839
like

1195
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:55,680
had some political views so that they

1196
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,920
would wreak havoc

1197
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,680
actually

1198
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,359
you know this was the first question for

1199
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,440
us

1200
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,839
to watch

1201
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,960
but you know what

1202
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,760
cases where a person would come to work

1203
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,240
on the 24th of february would log into

1204
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,280
the system and would off his workplace

1205
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,960
wipe the whole system

1206
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,960
has never happened at least in our

1207
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,680
experience all the wiping happened

1208
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,200
remotely

1209
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,640
well our customers did their own

1210
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,520
investigations

1211
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,400
i can talk about my own practice i don't

1212
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,640
know of a case like this

1213
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,280
is it possible yes it sure is

1214
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,359
and this is one of the first questions

1215
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,960
we will be asking

1216
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,960
but i personally have not seen a single

1217
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,960
case like this so far

1218
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,359
thank you and let me

1219
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,079
avoid the t-shirts

1220
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,480
so you get the black one for your abc

1221
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,799
question and who asked me about macros

1222
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:13,038
and powershell node.js here you go

1223
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,400
