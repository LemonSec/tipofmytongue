1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,759
and we're going to continue discussing

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,680
cyber security right now we're going to

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
speak about trends in cyber security

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
in my studio i have yi katy nicholson

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,560
who is the head of the team of analytics

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
and researchers in the positive

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,480
technologies company and this is a team

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,359
which

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
makes quarterly research annual research

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480
topical research and everything that we

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
can name from the point of view of

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,880
analytical researchers in the uh

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
cyber security and this is what you do

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,840
yes

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
so i'm i came to the right place katya

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,480
can you tell me please how the activity

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,760
of criminals have changed since the

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
beginning of the year which companies

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,840
become the targets of attacks

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
well i have several slides and i would

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,760
like to ask you to show them on the

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,239
screen

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
here it is

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,199
so we see it okay this slide please well

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
in q1 the number of attacks have grown

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,280
compared to the q4 of the last year

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
and even if in the second half of the

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
last year we've been speaking that

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
growth rates of attacks are slowing down

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
right now situation has changed

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,560
significantly the number of mass attacks

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
and target attacks is growing and

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,840
russian companies also based

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
great number of cyber threats but i

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
would like to point out that these

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439
attacks are very simple mass attacks

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,640
which are uh accessible to law qualified

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
criminals well in the beginning of the

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
year in telegram channels and in the

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,640
network they've been providing tools for

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
the attacks and instructions how to make

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
those attacks and any

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,439
one who desired could use them and

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,399
unfortunately even those mass attacks in

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,040
number of cases were successful and it's

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
understandable that it was discovered

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
and it's shown the low level of defense

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
of companies and speaking

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
about industries

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,040
main signs of the q1 were attacks

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,439
against state public facilities and

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,038
number of those attacks has doubled and

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,840
they did have attacks and attempts of

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
attacks against critical infrastructure

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
objects industrial companies some

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
transportation infrastructure companies

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,920
and what's interesting

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,120
top five attacked industries involved a

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
mass media

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
mass media you mean our

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
padme

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,920
society replacement of deface and sights

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,800
yes interface as well okay can you tell

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
me please what is the main peculiarity

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
of those attacks against russian

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
organizations what's so special about

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
them well what's so special about

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
russian companies being attacked because

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,800
they face big number of attacks directed

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,519
against denial of service so this could

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
be attacks of encoders

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
which are targeting destruction of the

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
infrastructure deletion of data and a

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
simpler attacks the dos

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
attacks also

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,400
interface attacks against interface of

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
the site uh tags for temporary

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
discontinuation of those resources

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
operation and i see the increase of the

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
attacks against web resources because

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
generally speaking the level of their

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,159
defense is not very high as we know from

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,480
our results of research

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,720
and the effect from these attacks is

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,920
very noticeable because a deface aside

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
unavailability of a certain resource

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
people will immediately see it and it

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
brings a big resonance in additional

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
criminals have a possibility of getting

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
access to user data

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
of this site nobody suffers but

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,599
everybody have discussed it yes

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
everybody's discussing it and if

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
criminals are lucky they get access to a

95
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
certain data which can be sold

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,959
afterwards and put into the open access

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,040
which will also be

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,519
widely discussed and leakages of this

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,760
data are very specific for the beginning

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
of the year and the well-known attack is

101
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,519
the attack

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
against yandex food the leakage of

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
personal user data and yesterday there

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
were meetings that this leaked data from

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
yandex food has been united uh with

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
leaks from other services and right now

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
the interactive map uh you can learn by

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,199
the address the passport data of a

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
person his name mobile phone and a lot

110
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
of other professional information

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
awful awfulness

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
when i've been reading news

113
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
recently

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
i was impressed by attacks against

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,880
different agra holdings do you remember

116
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
something about them

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
against some aggro holdings yes we did

118
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
have attacks like that they are very

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,479
noticeable because they are not typical

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,400
for russian reality previously we've

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,639
heard very seldom about those but right

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,759
now in the beginning of the year there

123
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
were attacks

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
against meat manufacturers against food

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,840
products manufacturers mira torque tower

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
and companies had to stop uh their

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
production temporarily plus there was a

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
very interesting attack when criminals

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
tried to destroy to spoil products and

130
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
by changing the temperature in the

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
cooling facilities but fortunately

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
nothing worked however they did make

133
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
such attempts and we also should

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,759
treat them seriously and take in

135
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,840
consideration that these consequences

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,800
might also happen but other threats

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,120
companies face today

138
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,919
well

139
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,840
the main threat is encoders

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,960
slide

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,479
i have a slide about this particular

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,000
topic

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
and you can see that a share of these

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,520
encoder attacks have reduced by this

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
reduction is insignificant and it was

146
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,680
caused by additional factors

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
and i will tell you about them and right

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,639
now we're observing very interesting

149
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,000
peculiarity last year we have noticed it

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
that amongst participants uh and amongst

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
in in quarters there are internal

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
conflicts and fights and if last year

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
they were related mostly with the fact

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,160
that

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
different groups they attacked same

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
companies several times several times

157
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,680
and there were even situations when

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
there were

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
some

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
false payments somebody was underpaid

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
and right now these internal things have

162
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
been added by external factors for

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
example right now uh due to some

164
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
ideological questions people have

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,479
misunderstands for example one of the

166
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,280
participants of ponzi group have

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,319
put the

168
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,800
source code of this encore

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
well it's not the first situation when

170
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
the participants published the tools in

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
the open access however this is an

172
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
interesting case that would like to

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,159
discuss

174
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,800
and how these encoders have been uh

175
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
distributed on the market mostly with

176
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,880
the use of vulnerabilities well-known

177
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
vulnerabilities for example

178
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
uh for example we have significant

179
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
number of critically important uh

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
vulnerabilities which are important for

181
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
those services which are located on the

182
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
external perimeter of the company and uh

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
criminals can

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
do remote execution of commands

185
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
vulnerabilities well known like look for

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
shell

187
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
i think this is a story of the last year

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,599
yeah it's a last year story

189
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
and this year we see another a

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
well-known spring for shell

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
vulnerability which also will be

192
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
used by criminals and right now

193
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,000
situation is following that uh we see

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
the fight the one who's going to be the

195
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
first one to find the vulnerability

196
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
criminal or the researcher who's going

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
to be the first one to make the patch or

198
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
the first one who will make the exploits

199
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
in order to win in this race the

200
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,800
companies should have very direct

201
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
testing of their products if they're

202
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,440
developing something and their systems

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
but how late usually they are how late

204
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
are they

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
well usually

206
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,319
and how faster exploits are coming to

207
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
the market than patches well the problem

208
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
is not that patches are coming later

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
than exploits but the problem is that

210
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
companies are not able to install those

211
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,400
patches

212
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,759
first of all

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
there are problems to classify

214
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,319
vulnerabilities and to understand what

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,800
has to be closed first of all and then

216
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,919
to understand that in your

217
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,120
infrastructure you have this

218
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,639
vulnerabilities dispatchers have to be

219
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
installed well this is very strange but

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,240
some companies they don't know that they

221
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,799
need to install uh some updates and this

222
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,199
is the main

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,519
and they problem it very fast in the

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
course of several hours yes in the

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
course of several hours in most of the

226
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,240
cases several days

227
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,680
before the appearance of the exploit

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,200
after the publication of the information

229
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
about vulnerability and they coming to

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,600
the market well i think that recently

231
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
very often you're speaking phrases like

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
supply chain open source open source

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
things like that and clouds

234
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
what has changed about this story

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
well supply chain still is very actual

236
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
trend especially this threat is very

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
dangerous if it's related to it company

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
which develops software because their

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,680
products could be the entry point uh for

240
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,160
older to older clients to corporate

241
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,399
networks and their corporate network of

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
this company and because of this i also

243
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
have to point out another peculiarity

244
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
which we have also noticed in the

245
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
beginning of this year it's the

246
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,160
injection of the

247
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
code uh into the software with open

248
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
source code because companies very often

249
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,680
use uh free

250
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
uh software and not many people are

251
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
checking it for security so in the

252
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,760
beginning of the year there were several

253
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
cases when

254
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
open libraries had some

255
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
malicious

256
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
injections and they were aimed against

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,080
developers in russia so this trend is

258
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,040
out there also about linux systems we

259
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
also have to say a couple of words about

260
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,040
it because linux systems right now they

261
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
get gained more and more popularity and

262
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
what else we have noticed it's

263
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,519
cross-platform trend that criminals are

264
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
rewriting their uh

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
this could be encoders it could be

266
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
remote control situations but if

267
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,279
previously they've been a threat for

268
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
windows systems right now

269
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,240
we see more and more malicious code for

270
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,880
linux systems and ready to work in any

271
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,399
other systems where they're going to be

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,800
enrolled well does it mean that linux

273
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
become more popular

274
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
linux yes linux becomes more popular

275
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,560
because

276
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
criminals do see it

277
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
and they do follow this trend and they

278
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
react on this

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
well today when we've been speaking in

280
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
the same studio with other participants

281
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
with other

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
people i've heard some stories that

283
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,959
everybody are going to move to clouds

284
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,920
and perhaps this will entail

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,440
certain uh tale of threats as well yes

286
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
of course because attacks against cloud

287
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
infrastructure against suppliers of

288
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
those cloud infrastructure whilst you

289
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
see them anymore there will be

290
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,240
proliferation of this technology

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
it means that criminals will have more

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
attacks against it

293
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
okay can you tell me please about

294
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,200
consequences why criminals uh are moving

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
this direction what

296
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
will be the consequences of this attacks

297
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
what happens more often more often we

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
see the data leakages

299
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,200
and there's another interesting topic

300
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
i've promised to speak about it some

301
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
encoders

302
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,480
moving from encoding of infrastructure

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,519
to simply stealing the data for example

304
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
there is a group called lapses which is

305
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
well known for its attacks against big

306
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,240
companies like samsung and video octa

307
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
and what else is so special about this

308
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
group is that very often they steal data

309
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
and i don't doubt that they have a

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
possibility of releasing the encoder but

311
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,880
they don't do that

312
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
they still didn't then they asked for

313
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
ransom for non-publishing of this data

314
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,839
so it's kind of a black male yeah it's a

315
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
black male but not for getting access

316
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,760
uh but just for non-publication of this

317
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,959
data

318
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,239
and another interesting topic

319
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,600
in quarters ransomware encoders came

320
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
from attacks of financial actives went

321
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
to the attacks directed against

322
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
destruction of the infrastructure so we

323
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,200
see that they've changed their motives

324
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,279
uh they attacked not with the purpose of

325
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,760
gaining access to money from the victim

326
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,560
but just to destroy the viability of the

327
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
and in company

328
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
we see that there was big number of

329
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
viper attacks what is wiper attack well

330
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,880
their mechanism is very similar with

331
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
ransomware encoders they either delete

332
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
data from the device or they encode

333
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
these data

334
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
but they do not provide the possibility

335
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,959
of

336
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,519
decoding this data they don't offer this

337
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
option so it's uh encoders in one

338
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
direction but what does the main sense

339
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
the sense is to destroy the viability

340
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,560
and integrity of the company and destroy

341
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,320
its infrastructure so this is change in

342
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,839
motifs

343
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,560
so we have two main consequences here is

344
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,720
the leakage of professional information

345
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,959
and violation of the main activities so

346
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,079
these attack results are being faced by

347
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,560
companies today so if we're going to

348
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
speak about examples you can remember

349
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
the recent attack of the ransomware

350
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
against the euro and the company had to

351
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,040
stop

352
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
some of their factories

353
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,959
and according to estimates these attack

354
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,560
might lead to the situation that they

355
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
could lose five percent of their average

356
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
revenue

357
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,839
well i would like to make some other

358
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
examples should i like vodafone there

359
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
was an attack against vodafone when

360
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,440
thousands of clients were without any

361
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,000
communications they could not call they

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
could not write sms

363
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
wasn't it an infrastructural error

364
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,800
according to the corporate information

365
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,599
it was an attack

366
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
this could be caused by errors but in in

367
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,880
this case it was an attack

368
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
what would you recommend to companies to

369
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
prevent protect themselves from these

370
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,399
attacks

371
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,720
well first of all i would recommend

372
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
companies to understand which events are

373
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
not admissible to them and understand

374
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,240
could these events be caused by cyber

375
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,959
attack and send all their efforts to

376
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,800
prevention

377
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
of these events they should check

378
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
possibility of

379
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,120
non possibility of these events in real

380
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,959
life because these attacks are leading

381
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,240
to serious negative consequences

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560

385
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,399
cyber security together with utility and

386
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,160
