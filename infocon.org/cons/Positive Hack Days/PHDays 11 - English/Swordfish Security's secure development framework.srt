1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,039
and apart from that i develop training

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,680
courses and i read them as devsicops and

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,359
opsec trainer

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,320
and i'm a lead development developer of

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
this great framework i'll be talking

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,760
about

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
so we'll be talking about secure

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,719
development frameworks i'll talk about

9
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,960
the approaches we have today

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,680
what we have done how we deal with it

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,039
and why we have decided to go public

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,000
with what we have done

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,200
well

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
i don't think that

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,239
i'll share a lot of new things with you

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,280
i'll start with some background

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
i think security guys

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,719
are

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,600
few and far between and up sex well even

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,080
worse there we don't have the guys or

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,040
the guys come from other

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
walks of life and there are issues in

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,920
terms of their skills the second issue

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
information security and upset

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
so i would say that these guys are not

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
pretty much on the radar of the top

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,400
management so they are more focusing on

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
the functions design and the customer

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,759
success things

30
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,640
and

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
the information security is kind of

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,799
overlooked

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
and the third issue is that information

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
security they come to development so

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
they say let's

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,119
do it safe

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,079
and you know the developers say we don't

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,000
understand this we are not going to do

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
anything we can say well we are in the

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,680
same boat we should walk together that's

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
not the case you know it looks like that

42
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,399
okay the people come to destroy the

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,759
functions

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,640
to

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
truncate everything

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,200
to

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
interfere with us and so on so we don't

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
want to hear this

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
and the next thing is that

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
you know the 90 percent

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,200
of the

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
things uh

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
done outside of russia are not going to

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
work in russia like the frameworks

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
approaches and the standards and the

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,959
other things they should be adapted

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,440
well when people say okay please

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
introduce their

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,879
static analysis we see that the

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,599
companies install it for one app which

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
is not critical with the three

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,800
developers and they say okay we have

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
done it we have installed the sas great

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
okay that's a problem what's the

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
solution

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
we need the framework so the things we

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
have today don't work so we know why now

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
okay if you waste

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
all the terminology

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
i believe that most of you have heard

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,760
this

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,399
nevertheless

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
framework is the recommended

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
recommendation and standard

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,159
is declarative there they are split into

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
domains so this kind of general

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
structure inside we have practices these

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
are the things inside the domains and

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,959
practices and then we have initiatives

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,720
so i have several initiatives in a

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,280
practice so we have branches the streams

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,360
these are the activities apparel for one

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,239
timeline and we have a security champion

84
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,360
and uh

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
this is a good guy for

86
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
security coming from development

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,360
okay let's talk about the frameworks

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
let's color them this way well bc is in

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
the center very popular everybody is

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,799
using it

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,920
not um well always the way they say

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,959
meant it to be used but anyway well open

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
sound which became our same uh microsoft

94
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,239
offspring and bsa ssf which looks like

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
the framework more than others you can

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,040
see there the asvs

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
well i have a standalone slide on them

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
well it wouldn't come here

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
if at least one or two companies would

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
say that they are developing

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
the development based on

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
asvs i've heard it about seven times

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,000
so i believe that's an issue where the

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,360
testing standard

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
is used a

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,918
framework for secure development so you

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,279
bring it to the architects and you tell

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,400
them do it this way or you set it

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
as a test okay that's okay but this is

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,759
not a framework it's not about building

111
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,240
processes or other important things

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,160
what do we have in russia okay in russia

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
we have things which look like

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,759
frameworks

115
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,759
this is the national standard 56 99

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,120
and uh

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,880
1 5 408 national standards

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
okay their processes

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,639
are there described by these national

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
standards and they're described pretty

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
well so if you start doing it okay it

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
will work out

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
but the question comes why are we not

124
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,600
using it we we have the processes the

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,680
documents this is all updated why are we

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
not using it because people don't

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
understand it and we are facing it and

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,240
very regularly

129
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,840
since we have come to the company and we

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
hear that there is a request for secure

131
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,400
development based on the national

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
standards and other standards who say

133
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,639
why are you not doing it and they say we

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
cannot understand

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
the these words so we do understand

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
because we have dealt with it a lot but

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,919
this is still an issue

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
how's it happening in practice okay

139
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
the companies coming to us with some

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
work done they started doing some secure

141
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
development and this is how it happens

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
they take a national standard they

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
cannot understand it

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
they put it aside then they take a

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
framework they can't understand it they

146
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,160
put it aside

147
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
and then time comes

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
say the manager would come or the

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
regulator they develop their own

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
methodology sometimes it looks more or

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,520
less convincing but sometimes it looks

152
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,639
like

153
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,840
translated

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
svs

155
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,160
or

156
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
like a combo of the national standard

157
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
and the framework well you cannot

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
enumerate things understand the current

159
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,080
level of maturity and you cannot

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
understand the process where you are

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,280
going

162
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
so this is the second case once you had

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
a funny situation

164
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
we came to a client everything was nice

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,960
and fluffy so we are asking about the

166
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,759
premises why they need it they say okay

167
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,319
we need it okay developers say

168
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,120
once a year ago we started introducing

169
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,080
static analysis we started doing ssdlc

170
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,919
let's say okay and what was the tool we

171
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
used they mentioned a tool this is not

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,160
an open source tool this is a vendor and

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
not a chip one let's say great and how

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
is it working

175
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840
and then silence came about 30 seconds

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
okay we're there so we thought maybe we

177
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
should change the question we'll say how

178
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
is it all working what do you like what

179
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
to do not like they say we don't know

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
where it sends the messages so for a

181
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,759
year they just paid for the license and

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
they couldn't figure out

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
where their messages from this tool

184
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
would be sent

185
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
well i would say this is an obvious

186
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520
issue

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,599
well when they come we say that secure

188
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,560
development is based on three pillars

189
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
tools a process and people so

190
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,960
instruments is the lower level

191
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,919
it can be replaced people is the highest

192
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
level the most important one

193
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,879
and

194
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,680
similarly behind

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
all this importance of people we forget

196
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
about the processes

197
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,039
and

198
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,560
we see some people who are more or less

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
okay with some tools

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
so they

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
have some kind of training in terms of

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,280
approach

203
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
or regulatory things and we have the

204
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,639
tools which are kind of a part and they

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,319
don't have an understanding of how to

206
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,840
use them

207
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,080
and uh this brings us to this situation

208
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,479
we have the tool so nominally it is

209
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,960
there it scans things and they say okay

210
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,160
we do scan but nobody knows the results

211
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
of this scanning okay if we bring it all

212
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
together we can conclude that framework

213
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
is not there so we have some maturity

214
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,399
levels uh sams some sams and so on

215
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,799
and we should develop our own framework

216
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,120
and the second issue

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,279
stemming from it is that the use of

218
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,240
these maturity models is kind of against

219
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,800
the russian legislation and standards

220
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
so quickly we have some laws talking

221
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,800
about restricted access to information

222
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
and here you can see

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,440
the commercial secret symbol

224
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
it can develop like that all the

225
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
maturity models tell us that you should

226
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
try to be as open as you can when

227
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,720
introducing your development processes

228
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
meaning if you're introducing a tool you

229
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,519
should tell everybody your portal

230
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
wikipedia and everywhere that this is

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,240
great you have done it speak about it at

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
a conference if you have an incident

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
please publish this information mention

234
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360
this it will be great

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
the commercial secrecy law tells us that

236
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
the company should determine what is uh

237
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
good or not good and here legally the

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
company can ban this information from

239
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
publishing

240
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
making it

241
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
available to a portal

242
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,399
and the opsec guys would send this

243
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,279
there

244
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,240
and

245
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,839
so the issue is clear and the major

246
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,920
issue is that we don't have

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
the process at all

248
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,640
so what does it mean if we introduce

249
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
the theme we have 102 practices there in

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
the latest version if you

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
use all this it will work and bring you

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
the results at least

253
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
some

254
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
minimal results but you should

255
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,680
understand that we are talking about

256
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
implementations of small companies

257
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,079
who cannot implement everything at once

258
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
nobody can do it so we start with

259
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,680
pinpoint uh

260
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
deployment of analyzers

261
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
tests training which can be bad and

262
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,959
finally the process is not there we have

263
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
some pinpoint scratched around

264
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
tests

265
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
so

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
once upon a time somebody came to me to

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
say sweater please introduce ssdlc i

268
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
didn't know what ssdlc was i looked up i

269
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
found some similar words

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,600
and uh well i just started dealing with

271
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,800
it i decided okay i need to analyze oh

272
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
to use the static analyzer so that's the

273
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
day of the static analyzer

274
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,240
and i decided okay the stat analysis

275
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
should be introduced

276
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
and um

277
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
this will let us let me

278
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
say that this is opsec okay you just

279
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,399
look for a solution

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
you procure it and you install it if

281
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,800
it's open source and then you roll it

282
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
out throughout your other apps in the

283
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
company bingo it works no it doesn't it

284
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
doesn't work like that

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,240
and the worst thing is that i still hear

286
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,959
this that deploying assessed

287
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
is a simple thing this is the first

288
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
level practice you just buy it you

289
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,399
install it and everything is

290
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,160
great no

291
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,120
here is the list the checklist

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
30 30 initiatives

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,800
to be performed to say that you have

294
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
static analysis

295
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,399
so these are the 30 activities

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
i'm not sure whether we can zoom in

297
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,560
hopefully you can read it

298
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,959
so these are the things to be done to

299
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,680
make the aesthetic analyzer

300
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
work in your company so the previous

301
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
slides number one analyzing the

302
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
solutions and this is item seven

303
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,920
so we have a lot

304
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
we have a lot of prerequisites

305
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,680
just to go and start analyzing the

306
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
solutions and this is okay i should

307
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
understand the code base the budget the

308
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,360
risks and the constraints and i should

309
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
understand the team or the developers

310
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
can do and whether they're willing to do

311
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,320
it

312
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,880
and this is without the sub tasks each

313
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,440
of these initiatives has within it a

314
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
number of tasks

315
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
which will be well

316
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,160
some small steps

317
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
okay

318
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,240
this has been the preface now

319
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,519
i'll talk

320
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,040
about the more serious stuff

321
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
we have dealt with a lot of clients and

322
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
i believe that

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
i have worked with

324
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
several dozen of them so i can say that

325
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
we can say that we know a thing or two

326
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
about it

327
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
okay this is the structure of the

328
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,480
framework we don't want to reinvent

329
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
the will so we use this tree-like

330
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,399
approach we have the domains or

331
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,279
practices initiatives and tasks every

332
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,600
framework has it in

333
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
a fashion

334
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,639
so it can be the national standard or

335
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,560
foreign standard mentioned this as well

336
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
what did we add the completion

337
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,279
conditions and the profits okay the

338
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,519
completion conditions i believe that

339
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,639
this is

340
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,839
a very important thing

341
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,040
very often

342
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,240
any practice okay well it can be not

343
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,639
the end point one and you cannot say

344
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,839
when

345
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
it's nice and we can recover for

346
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,680
instance

347
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
so they are at the initiative and task

348
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
level depending on the block and the

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,880
content of the initiative and task

350
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
and they are

351
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,920
a kind of

352
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,720
and

353
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,959
end sentence you read it you compare it

354
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,399
with what is happening now and you can

355
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,199
say yes it's cool

356
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,319
we can tick the box

357
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
and start doing other things

358
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,519
and profit is a good thing as well

359
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
it lets you communicate

360
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,399
the ideas of the top management

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
and uh you can reach it with what or why

362
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,279
we are doing it why we need this

363
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
practice and not any other practice why

364
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
do we need this element right now

365
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
a few words about the content of the

366
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,319
framework

367
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,240
so the baseline thing should be the

368
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,639
management domain for secure development

369
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
this domain has a lot of good things

370
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,199
including

371
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,920
risk assessment and threat modeling

372
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,839
threat modeling is

373
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,560
often forgotten about

374
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,199
by upset well

375
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,199
indeed this is

376
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,440
really important modern threats when you

377
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
are doing secure development this is not

378
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,320
like

379
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,079
you know having the

380
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,959
um

381
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,880
you know bible hiddens in a drawer

382
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,680
so

383
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
here we are talking about the

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
rules regulations and um

385
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,320
other things and so we need to re-audit

386
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,440
your process all the time

387
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
the next domain is the secure

388
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,240
development platform the platform

389
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
has everything you can check in an

390
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
automated way and some things like

391
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,759
design review without these practices

392
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,480
you

393
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,000
shouldn't uh

394
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
start coding or analyzing

395
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
testing is also here

396
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
and

397
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,959
this is not in terms of the functions or

398
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,279
loads

399
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
test here we are talking about

400
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,959
introducing some

401
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,399
sac elements into functional testing

402
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
the next domain is managing

403
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
vulnerabilities

404
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
it can be mentioned

405
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,519
as

406
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,560
having two big parts to it

407
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440
so the first one we determine what we do

408
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,199
when we

409
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,959
see the flex so who will sort out the

410
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
defects who will deal with it and the

411
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
second thing is what do we do with the

412
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
running apps

413
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
meaning

414
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
how do we analyze them how we monitor

415
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
them what do we monitor and what do we

416
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,519
do

417
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,720
so for

418
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,360
monitoring like that we often need

419
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
external experts and the final domain is

420
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,839
training

421
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,240
well i like to say that each domain is

422
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
extremely important and this is

423
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
especially true for training because

424
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
without that you'll have a hard time

425
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
starting anything

426
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,279
and especially the upside activities a

427
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,040
very important thing in training we are

428
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,839
trying to highlight every time we can is

429
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
the need of awareness continuous ever as

430
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,959
if the opposite guys

431
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,560
or those who do

432
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
id sex so if we

433
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
don't keep the developers interested

434
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
then the interest

435
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,880
will fade away and we'll have some

436
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
issues there this is something to be

437
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
focused on from the outset

438
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
okay this is the process overview do

439
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,359
remember the 30 practices

440
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,720
here they are

441
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,079
split

442
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
horizontally

443
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
so you can see the assessed this is the

444
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,480
practice which is uh one of these

445
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039
domains everything you can see here are

446
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,880
initiatives so the best way would be to

447
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
develop

448
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
schemes like that for every practice

449
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,919
since

450
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
introducing cest is impossible without

451
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,039
pre-training and pre-risk assessment and

452
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,679
many other supporting activities they

453
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,200
are all happening in different domains

454
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,280
and they often start with the same

455
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,400
timeline or even before than we wanted

456
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
so the only right way

457
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,360
here would be to understand

458
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
how the process starts and how it ends

459
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
so the starting and the ending points

460
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,799
a few words about the practices i

461
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,559
mentioned before the initiatives

462
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
here

463
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
we can see the start of analysis so you

464
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
can see through the timeline that it

465
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
starts

466
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
so it's not the first to start before

467
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
that we need some ssd understanding in

468
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
the company we are going to introduce

469
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,480
this initiative we need to understand

470
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
what is going to be built in the teams

471
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
the number

472
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,200
we should understand the requirements

473
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
kind of quality of the stat analyzer so

474
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,039
what we shall

475
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,480
see is the requirement there should it

476
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,120
be a russian or not russian and

477
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,159
what we should do

478
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
with this identified vulnerabilities and

479
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,799
here we should start training

480
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,919
the developers and the

481
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
information security experts should have

482
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
this basic understanding of the tool

483
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,280
which was going to help us speed up

484
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
the development process and improve the

485
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,039
quality of the software we produce

486
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
having analyzed all that

487
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,919
and

488
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,760
having received the list are the tools

489
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
to be introduced

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,960
we will

491
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
start the practical part we'll start

492
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
introducing the stat analysis in the

493
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,720
mvp projects okay we introduce it in one

494
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,559
or two projects by a couple of teams

495
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,320
which are loyal to us and they're ready

496
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
to install this tool then we determine

497
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,720
the quality gate we need then we fine

498
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,440
tune this about here we have the first

499
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,559
scan

500
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
and then we analyze the results and

501
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,360
build the report for the management and

502
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
for the developers for help us to

503
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,200
understand that it's really bad and we

504
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,919
need to fix the things so at the

505
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,600
development uh

506
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
stage of this report we have about two

507
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,159
or three hundred hits with about eighty

508
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,320
percent of all false positive results

509
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,159
okay what do we add to the framework

510
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,880
okay we have the decomposition by tasks

511
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
and completion conditions

512
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,640
and here

513
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
introducing this

514
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
static analysis to their mvp

515
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,400
so we have three tasks here

516
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
so determining the mvp project

517
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,440
deploying

518
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
the tool and determining those in charge

519
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,799
for

520
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,200
dealing with the hits

521
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,600
so to say that this is done and we can

522
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,799
proceed

523
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
we should uh satisfy this completion

524
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
criteria so he'll be dealing with these

525
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
hits and the tools should be working

526
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,760
only then we can proceed

527
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
okay what should be the profit

528
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
so the opsec and uh

529
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
mesh security guy will shoot with the

530
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
management

531
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,799
so it should be not technical

532
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
so we are saying that the stat analysis

533
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,159
is the only clever way to cover a lot of

534
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,679
code it doesn't need credential it

535
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,000
doesn't need a testing bench and so on

536
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
and so forth so let us roll it out

537
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,200
everywhere

538
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,600
so we added some mappings

539
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
the framework

540
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,559
mappings bc

541
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,799
and

542
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
the national standards mathematics

543
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
because we are working in russia so this

544
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,760
mappings might look like that so they

545
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
are overall there so we have the domain

546
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,240
secure development where we have the

547
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,520
chest there

548
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,440
and here we have national standards

549
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
here

550
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
some somewhere we have more details so

551
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
that's we

552
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,120
did as well and so this is for the b

553
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,080
seam

554
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,640
and sometimes it is

555
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
more detailed

556
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,159
well

557
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,799
we also have frameworks

558
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
well follow my speech i believe you

559
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,840
should understand

560
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,199
that this looks like that

561
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
and

562
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,400
this is a

563
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
really big thing and we're ambitious

564
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
for us

565
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,679
so

566
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,280
i will highlight

567
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,679
our next steps and what we are going to

568
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,520
do

569
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
the first thing

570
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,640
which is crucial

571
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,919
is adding costs for implementation the

572
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,520
practices and initiatives the more

573
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,240
detailed we can be the better so we've

574
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,600
talked about the profits why we need

575
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,000
them so now let's talk about the costs

576
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
so that the company can really

577
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,919
understand

578
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,559
its capacity to implement this

579
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,039
initiative

580
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,799
so we're not only talking about the

581
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
money saying that the analyzer costs

582
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
some money we're also talking about

583
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,960
resources and the time to be invested

584
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,760
we want to add more mapping

585
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,919
we want to have more

586
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
russian national standards

587
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
which are about secure development

588
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
processes maybe they talk about

589
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
monitoring incidents and so on so the

590
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
ones having any bearing on it and also

591
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,600
the industrial standards they should be

592
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
developed this is really

593
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,720
important

594
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,919
and

595
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,799
pci is developing and so so we really

596
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,039
need it

597
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
the third thing to do

598
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,120
is to analyze

599
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,679
the list of processes

600
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,480
to build the list of

601
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
initiatives so that we review them

602
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
regularly and assess their maturity and

603
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,039
we took it from bsim by the way

604
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,600
and every year we should have a new

605
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,520
updated version

606
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,720
and this will help us stay afloat

607
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
and

608
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,559
be

609
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,679
relevant

610
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,600
and the timeline should be added here

611
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,480
here you can see some practices

612
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,400
and to their relative position the

613
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
timeline is missing here

614
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,279
so we want to have a kind of average

615
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,840
of the time needed for initiative to be

616
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,360
introduced in a given practice

617
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
so we can take the average say this will

618
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
take a week this will take a month so

619
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
that people

620
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,120
can understand

621
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,039
how long it will take to implement the

622
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,679
whole process

623
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
that's it for me

624
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
i'd like to thank you

625
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,039
and tell you

626
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,960
that sooner or later we'll upload this

627
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,080
framework

628
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,720
so please follow our updates

629
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,080
if you have any questions on the

630
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,880
framework or any good ideas on how it

631
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
can be extended or

632
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,440
updated or you can see something missing

633
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
from it if you want to introduce the

634
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
processes following this framework so

635
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,640
you can use my telegram or email for

636
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,600
your comments thank you

637
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,880
yeah i've been quick to have more time

638
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
for q a

639
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
so this can be a dumb question i'm not

640
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,600
sure

641
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,919
well all this stuff

642
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
you have mentioned

643
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
looks like that

644
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
as if it could be automated

645
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,799
and sold as a product

646
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,480
have you thought

647
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,520
about it

648
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,120
is it possible

649
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
otherwise why

650
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,840
sure

651
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,039
i believe you can automate almost

652
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,039
everything with the exception of the

653
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
high quality

654
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
work of the brain

655
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
so we'll have um some issues trying to

656
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,919
automate things i mean there'll be

657
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,520
companies telling us i don't want to

658
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,919
introduce the library's analysis try

659
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,440
please remove it from the framework and

660
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
you'll have to do it

661
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,320
well i believe it can be introduced

662
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,159
like a roadmap

663
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
for measuring things but this should be

664
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,720
done at the orchestration grade tools

665
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,840
thank you i came later sorry if i missed

666
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
it

667
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
the timeline was one thing i was missing

668
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
but nothing was some kind of order

669
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,360
i mean we understand that we deploy the

670
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,760
risk analysis and

671
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,640
threat modeling

672
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,960
so i believe this is much more difficult

673
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,960
than buying a tool talking to developers

674
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,279
developing their cicd plugin so you

675
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
start doing something

676
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,000
do you have any plans to introduce it

677
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,880
well this is something taking less time

678
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,799
so why not start there

679
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,960
so if we start with item one we can uh

680
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,120
so this can take a lot of time given the

681
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,679
approach of business to this

682
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,200
hopefully i

683
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,640
understood your question i believe we

684
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,720
are talking about the maturity level i

685
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
didn't highlight it because we didn't go

686
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,960
through this

687
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,360
in detail

688
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,959
so we have some practices

689
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,799
okay threat modeling

690
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,799
it will be split

691
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,440
by levels

692
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,600
we say well we have some baseline

693
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
threat modeling to be done

694
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,200
to start developing the app

695
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,320
and we

696
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
bring some recommendations like the

697
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
threat model should have there

698
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,399
some

699
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,880
best practices and then level three is

700
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,840
your own data bank of threats and then

701
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,279
you have some

702
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,840
private threat models okay a follow-up

703
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,760
question we have ttm

704
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,880
and sometimes you just come you start

705
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
talking about a threat modeling and they

706
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,039
tell you we have ttm goodbye

707
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,720
so maybe we have a smoke test

708
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
analog so we can go

709
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
by some

710
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
bullet points to understand okay we can

711
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,039
do it so go ahead and then we'll have a

712
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,080
backlog to deal with

713
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,039
well

714
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,960
you know i've been scared

715
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
me too

716
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
and hence the questions

717
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,240
okay i got you

718
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,320
if we go to assessed

719
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,840
threat modeling

720
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,880
is not there because it's uh

721
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,360
comprehensive and but we need some

722
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,159
baseline risk assessment otherwise you

723
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
know they will beat you badly

724
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,360
and

725
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
at ttm in a way this is a very good

726
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
piece of advice we'll

727
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,120
put it into our pipe and smoke it

728
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,279
thank you

729
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,600
what are the tools apart from sas to be

730
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
supported by your framework

731
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
so we know that secure development is

732
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
not only about static analysis but also

733
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,840
the dynamic one and the directive one

734
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,240
and the open source

735
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
code analysis which is really important

736
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
now

737
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,080
because the things are developing in a

738
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,039
way

739
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,279
telling us that it has to be checked for

740
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,880
backdoors

741
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
and

742
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,799
another thing the collect mentioned time

743
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,399
to market so

744
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,960
what are the metrics in your framework

745
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
the business uh

746
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,840
has never cared and is not going to care

747
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,799
about

748
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,240
dry numbers

749
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,279
so they want their dynamics the

750
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,000
dynamics of change

751
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,039
for liabilities coverage how many

752
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,039
have been identified and fixed

753
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,559
so do you use the metrics in your

754
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,039
framework

755
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,840
the first question

756
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,240
tooling the tools

757
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
which are necessary as shown here the

758
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
static dynamic analysis

759
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,360
the components control occ the

760
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,679
containers control

761
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,360
and in dust we also have

762
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
the

763
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,279
yester and fuzzing

764
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
well wire fuzzing is not mentioned to

765
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
standalone practice

766
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,799
that's because we believe that

767
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
introducing fuzzing

768
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
in under

769
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
their companies on their level of

770
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,000
maturity is not justified so it can be

771
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,200
done only by the advanced ones

772
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,519
and we are going to further develop this

773
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,320
core we'll be adding more practices to

774
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,120
this

775
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,559
like app security

776
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
or secret management

777
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,919
if you have any target proposals

778
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,320
we'll be glad to hear them

779
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,559
for the second part are the metrics

780
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,600
we have the secure development domain

781
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,480
and there we start with the ssdl

782
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
and then we have metrics

783
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,519
well the metrics mean that the company

784
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,399
will determine its own what it wants to

785
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,880
track and trace so we can

786
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
bring forward some recommendations so

787
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,039
the framework is about recommendations

788
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,880
it's not restrictive so we'll be talking

789
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,399
about the things

790
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,919
you can use so

791
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,519
how to

792
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
track tools inside the tools we'll also

793
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,960
have this advice on what you should

794
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,799
monitor so this is the number of

795
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
vulnerabilities

796
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
which can be fixed

797
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
and some

798
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,200
very high level metrics which will pop

799
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,919
up

800
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,360
somewhere

801
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,840
in training the management

802
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,679
and there'll be a ton of this we have

803
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,919
found this great vulnerability the other

804
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
company didn't find it and they had to

805
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,960
pay 500

806
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
million dollars

807
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,440
so

808
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,519
here we give some piece of advice and

809
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,039
the rest is to be determined by the

810
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,760
company itself

811
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
another

812
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,880
question are you going to make this

813
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,279
framework public as i understand it's

814
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,200
in-house now

815
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,320
well

816
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,720
indeed

817
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,039
when we came to the clients and we

818
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,760
wanted to start things we had a monthly

819
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,080
collection of frameworks and standards

820
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,880
uh

821
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
whatever

822
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,039
and

823
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,679
time came when we decided

824
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
to do it the way we see it proper

825
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,679
and now

826
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,840
well that's what we have we are going to

827
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,240
publish it as an open source solution to

828
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,679
the community

829
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,320
so that people use it and help us

830
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,360
further develop it make it stronger

831
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,640
in terms of the content and quality

832
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
thank you

833
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,919
okay

834
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,200
it's your

835
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,519
product and you want to add it at the

836
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,000
community there yeah we want

837
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,640
so this is one of open points so

838
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,039
you can hardly do anything without

839
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,880
the community because there are many

840
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,399
companies

841
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,440
thank you

842
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
a follow-up question

843
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,360
when

844
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,399
that's a good question

845
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,679
i believe this is going to happen

846
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,000
somewhere

847
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,360
in autumn more or less but i'm quite

848
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,000
optimistic here

849
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,480
okay

850
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,440
we have the regulator stack and they

851
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,320
have the methods for analyzing

852
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,520
all abilities and non-declared

853
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,119
functionality so

854
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,800
how do you match this requirement with

855
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,679
your

856
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
approach we haven't mapped

857
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,079
this and this method

858
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,159
methodology well

859
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,320
we have plans to do this the key element

860
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,239
in the framework is that we don't want

861
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,040
to go against anything this includes

862
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,719
national and foreign regulators

863
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,040
well

864
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,918
this is

865
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,280
against 56

866
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,839
539 rule

867
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,920
i have a brief comment the metrics

868
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,839
and the

869
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,560
framework

870
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
you can have the video from the previous

871
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,800
speech days anton mahalin our colleague

872
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,520
spoke to the positive development group

873
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,119
about the metrics how they are to be

874
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,960
built how you can collect them and how

875
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,839
you can use them

876
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
hello i have two questions

877
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
thread modeling

878
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,640
to model a thread for an app in

879
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
production with a well

880
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
thought through architecture would be a

881
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,280
strange thing

882
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,320
but if this is a new app

883
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
it's very good for modeling so do you

884
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,000
have this framework nes split in terms

885
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,359
of the readiness stage okay we introduce

886
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
these methods

887
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
for the

888
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
app so we will start coding and these

889
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
practices will be launched for the apps

890
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,160
which are there installed for 10 years

891
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,359
now

892
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,359
that's a great question

893
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,920
indeed we have things like that but not

894
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
for all the blocks

895
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
we don't have it in threat management

896
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,400
there we say that for any app

897
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,520
be it deployed or be it

898
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
just at the idea stage the threat model

899
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,400
should be developed

900
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,520
well here i'm based on the microsoft sdl

901
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,680
and there they have a gateway so when we

902
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,400
start developing a new app we understand

903
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
that we

904
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
cannot remove the

905
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,760
threads we just don't launch it and we

906
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
just kill it at the initial stage which

907
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,440
cannot be done

908
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,720
at the poorly coded app

909
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
well indeed but this is a different

910
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
question

911
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
so

912
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
the resources to be invested

913
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,520
whether it's justified but we say that

914
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,680
it should be done because when you model

915
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,720
the launched app and how often well

916
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,680
is the nap well which is the core

917
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
for the company and dealing with them

918
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,320
can be an issue

919
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
when you model this app you can

920
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,320
introduce some mitigation measures and

921
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,960
this will simplify life for you

922
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
and i have another question

923
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,480
the prophets

924
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
and the outputs so things already

925
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,960
introduced

926
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,040
here's an incest for instance

927
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,880
you said that you know people who will

928
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,760
mitigate the vulnerabilities but you're

929
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,680
not talking about uh the mitigation

930
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,480
or

931
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,440
well

932
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
i mean the metrics it's not like having

933
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
everything for everything but more

934
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,560
practical things

935
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
and for the practical things you've

936
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,200
mentioned that you're going to

937
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,119
assess the cost of

938
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,720
implementation

939
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,480
well you have the methodological

940
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,240
regulations do you

941
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,040
envisage any assessments

942
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,800
of the monthly profit you can generate

943
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
thank you that's a great question

944
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,440
we've done something in this field we

945
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,880
tried to understand uh the return on

946
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
capital

947
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,520
employed in opsec this is a standalone

948
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,960
issue

949
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
indeed we want

950
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,920
to have as much knowledge as we can

951
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,280
there

952
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
so

953
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,720
which is not on the idea because

954
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
otherwise

955
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,200
the framework will be limited to the

956
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,280
same likes gladly sharing all the

957
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,480
experience we have including the

958
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,440
community experience man

959
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,560
i have two questions here

960
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,240
i believe that uh

961
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,599
following the ssdlc everybody wants to

962
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,920
understand uh

963
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,560
the extra labor needed

964
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
from the developers so if you use the

965
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,400
zest as uh

966
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
example okay you have introduced this

967
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,920
process process well

968
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,000
well how

969
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
much more we'll have to invest in terms

970
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
of dealing with false positives and

971
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
other things

972
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,599
so the extra capacity needed

973
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,480
thank you that's a good question

974
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,560
it's almost 100 percent at the initial

975
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,160
stage the development stage but

976
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
following one year when people have

977
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
learned how to work with it

978
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,040
then

979
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,560
one extra person can deal with it say

980
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
you have five people one security

981
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,960
champion will be 50

982
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,359
of labor capacity yes

983
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,960
he or she will do some development but

984
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,119
the major cope will be to deal with the

985
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,520
the facts generated by the two

986
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
and this is the ideal case well

987
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,040
initially

988
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,560
well any new process

989
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
causes a lot of

990
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
pain

991
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,560
and the important thing is that people

992
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,960
cannot do it and they don't want to do

993
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
it and that's why

994
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
the labor investment

995
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,040
source at this

996
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,920
level

997
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
thank you the second question of the

998
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,880
metrics using sas as an example any

999
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200
sensed analyzer

1000
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,000
we'll update the rules and the core

1001
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,880
and

1002
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,040
they can become smarter

1003
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
or dumber

1004
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
and for the metrics you can use the

1005
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,640
dashboard and you can say that yesterday

1006
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,440
the product was in the green zone no

1007
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
vulnerabilities but today we have

1008
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,280
updated sas

1009
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,599
and we can see some vulnerabilities

1010
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,040
there

1011
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,240
so in the teams people take it quite

1012
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,760
negatively

1013
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
so what's your position

1014
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,079
how to talk to the teams about it how to

1015
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,599
position it

1016
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,839
and how to justify it

1017
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,560
that the company has a new technical

1018
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,640
debt now so how to deal with it

1019
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
there are two ways to do it so number

1020
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,160
one you can say that this is inevitable

1021
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,400
please deal with it so that's not our

1022
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,319
advice so be friends

1023
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,720
explain things to the teams the things

1024
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,839
you have mentioned and the second one

1025
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,920
was on whether you can

1026
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
automate it so that's a great example

1027
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,079
why it cannot be automated

1028
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,480
since we believe that following every

1029
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,280
scan well ideally i'm not talking about

1030
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,160
incremental things once uh 24 hours i'm

1031
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,079
talking about more global things

1032
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,160
so once every two to

1033
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,920
four days you should

1034
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,960
revise

1035
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,800
the rules you have for the static

1036
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,079
analysis

1037
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,800
especially following an update well

1038
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,119
usually it happens like that we have an

1039
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,200
update we have generated a lot of

1040
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,839
technical debt and we don't forget about

1041
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,000
the developers we come to them to help

1042
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,800
them

1043
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,839
so we need the upside department for

1044
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,000
this they come together to be the

1045
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,319
guidance star for the developers thank

1046
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,119
you

1047
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,280
thank you

1048
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
any other questions i believe there was

1049
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,000
another question here okay thank you

1050
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,839
let's make them

1051
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,520
well

1052
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,759
following and noted

1053
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,280
on some

1054
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,920
pcid sense so you have some kind of

1055
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,720
scoring like this is two scores this is

1056
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,040
five and then they said that have five

1057
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,680
and you did fifteen and you are in a bad

1058
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,560
shape

1059
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,880
so do you have anything like that can i

1060
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,119
launch this framework to see okay i have

1061
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,240
done this i haven't done that

1062
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,319
this is uh 10 points so this is 15

1063
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,800
points for me to understand they're more

1064
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,400
costly things and things to pay

1065
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,599
attention to

1066
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,880
and then thanks

1067
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,680
so

1068
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,839
are we going to have a metric like that

1069
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,480
thank you that's a very good question

1070
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,800
and a timely one yes we have this metric

1071
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,560
so what's good about these frameworks

1072
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,400
like b simps and so on

1073
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
so you can bring them to your ceo to

1074
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,280
tell you that you can see

1075
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,839
this net this is the maximum this is the

1076
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,079
current status and we want to build the

1077
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,680
same thing that's why we need the

1078
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,200
maturity levels we need to further

1079
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,920
develop it talking about the baseline

1080
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,680
approach that all the first great level

1081
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,880
practices which are mentoring they'll be

1082
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,359
more in terms of points

1083
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,359
than the third level

1084
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,640
practices

1085
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,440
so

1086
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,040
so the breto rule works here the 80 of

1087
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,839
practices will cover 80 percent of

1088
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,720
vulnerabilities

1089
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,480
why are we doing it

1090
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,040
so the companies who can come to us so

1091
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,520
we'll introduce it for them

1092
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,800
and we want the small companies who have

1093
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,480
three developers there we want them to

1094
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,960
use this framework to have uh all this

1095
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,400
developed

1096
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,280
thing

1097
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,880
at least secure in some ways

1098
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,920
okay one more question

1099
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,400
thank you very much

1100
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,119
we have heard various questions answered

1101
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,880
and here is my question

1102
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,200
looking at this as a developer i have a

1103
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,439
team

1104
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,480
okay we have 10 points and we need 15

1105
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,640
points

1106
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
so are we confident that

1107
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,880
this is not going to become just another

1108
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
framework without automation like the

1109
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,560
national standard and the other

1110
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
previously measured frameworks

1111
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,240
now the question is

1112
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,560
what makes you confident that this is

1113
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,359
not going to be just another framework

1114
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,680
thank you

1115
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,400
when i

1116
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,880
shared this framework with my friends my

1117
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
good friend told me well sweetheart we

1118
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,200
have a lot of practices for losing

1119
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,720
weight in the internet why are not

1120
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,839
people using it

1121
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,839
and this brings us to the very first

1122
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,920
slide we don't have enough competencies

1123
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
well to use bc

1124
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,800
well sam and so so they can be used in a

1125
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,880
good way when you are competent enough

1126
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,200
and when you have some expertise

1127
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,680
so we make the process as transparent as

1128
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,839
we can with the tasks and with the

1129
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,920
completion criteria

1130
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,560
so that those who used to be like me and

1131
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,800
now they open the framework they read it

1132
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
they shouldn't be scared away and they

1133
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,359
should say okay i split this big task

1134
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
into the smaller tasks and then i'll

1135
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,680
manage it so this is a psychological

1136
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,560
trick

1137
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,319
and it helps a lot

1138
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,240
so that's why i

1139
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,520
hope it is going to work

1140
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,240
okay thank you no more questions

1141
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,880
thank you very much i believe i should

1142
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,359
pick the best question

1143
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,040
well

1144
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,319
this guy

1145
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,119
he asked a lot of useful questions

1146
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,280
and he gave us more

1147
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,359
food for thought okay thank you very

1148
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,359
much
