1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,480
all right uh can i show my presentation

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,800
please

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
good day i'm andre birikov in this

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,119
presentation i'll talk about

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,039
a hardware concept

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
to protect

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
against usb attacks

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
what's the essence

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
it's let's assume we have a network

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
of an organization where we have one

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,239
segment physically isolated

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,719
uh from the rest of the network so it

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
has no connection to it whatsoever

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
and i'm in here by the internet

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
those sec segments that have access to

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,879
that

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
inside the isolated segment we have

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
computers servers

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
and we need to deliver different files

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,479
to them anti-virus updates the updates

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
for operating systems

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
and other files

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,960
the simplest way to run it

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
is definitely to use

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
usb devices

26
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,159
like

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
usb drives we download the files on a

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,759
usb drive we bring it up

29
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,119
and we insert it in a usb port and

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,119
upload the files but there may be

31
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,799
threats

32
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,240
because this usb key can be exposed to

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
various viruses threats a boot sector

34
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,759
may be infected on it containing

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,159
malicious files

36
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,680
so the person who inserts

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
the usb drive may be unaware of anything

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,799
bad that he is risking of doing but

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,240
may damage

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
the system with viruses it's one classic

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,399
threat then there may be devices that

42
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
act like a usb drive

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,760
for example a rubber duck

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
with the embedded

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,760
applications that run commands on behalf

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
of a current user and they may initiate

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,160
these attacks or for example teensy

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,360
uh

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
firmware i spoke about it some time ago

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,239
unlike a rubber duck you can upload

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,280
your own firmware to teensy and you can

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
use your custom

53
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
options

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
we also have bad usb devices that

55
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,319
perform these attacks

56
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,040
on usb controller

57
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,879
from flash drives and things that act

58
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800
like them

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
consciously the users may smuggle

60
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,440
different

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
usb

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
modems and different

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
keys

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,599
and dongles

65
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
so some fraudulent user may bring a

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,480
dongle

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
to the isolated segment and immediately

68
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
turning this segment into a non-isolated

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
one and some suspicious content there

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
may be some legal files written on the

71
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
usb file but it's

72
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,840
undesirable so that these files are

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,319
located uh in the isolated segment like

74
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,120
for example debuggers etc

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
for example there may be

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
a user

77
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
a student who is smuggled some debugging

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
tools to this sector and then it may

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
result in very unpleasant

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
consequences

81
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
and

82
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
the charges and the charges

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,760
and

84
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,680
we all know that the users

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
may want to charge

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
their devices

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,920
and

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,518
such threats may arise

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
like previously we said

90
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,238
there may be an lnk file with a

91
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,560
malicious code running on it

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
like a warm raspberry robin

93
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,919
that

94
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,880
gets

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
into this environment

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,040
how do you normally

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,000
combat that you can use the anti-virus

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
solution for that it's a simplest

99
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
solution

100
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
they may

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
know which kind of anti-virus solution

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
is used here and they may obfuscate

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
their malicious

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,840
code so that the antivirus lets it

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
through

106
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,400
and would always have a delay in the

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
updates of the anti-virus

108
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,040
databases so

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
if

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
if a fraudster uses a teraday

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
such viruses may get to the network

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479
from a

113
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,160
dangerous device

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
much earlier there may be such policies

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
like for example for prohibit to use

116
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
these usb devices and

117
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
it's not always possible to do it

118
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
quickly so there's some fine tuning

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
required

120
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
dlp system uh is needed to eradicate

121
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
such problems but they're not intended

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
for doing that so you can you can give

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
it a try but uh that's not the best

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
option

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
so the best option that that would be

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
recognized here especially in the

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,240
governmental institutions is the

128
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
physical eradication of usb ports like

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
for example they glue them with tape

130
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
and sometimes

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
system devices

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,479
are put in a separate

133
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,520
room

134
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
and only the peripherals like mouse and

135
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,520
key keyboard are available to users

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
so people cannot physically have

137
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,560
access to a system block

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
but there may always be some human

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
errors people tend to make mistakes and

140
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
pose threats

141
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
of course you can use ideas i but if you

142
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,280
use this network in production solutions

143
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
in

144
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
this closed environment it's not always

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
efficient apart from that these

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
networking solutions

147
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,120
they need need updates and would

148
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
have delays

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
because of that

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,120
some sandbox solutions may also be

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,039
applied here where

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,319
we can use sandboxes but sandboxes also

153
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,600
need updates and it would also cause a

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,479
delay

155
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
so it's one of the

156
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
disadvantages of this anti-viral

157
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
solution as an alternative i would be

158
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,759
offering this hardware solution

159
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,560
an intermediary device between the pc

160
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,520
and the usb device which would read the

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,360
files and usb drives match the files for

162
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,800
matching the policies and emulate

163
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,639
this device

164
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
and connect it to the pc with only

165
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
allowed files so we have a pc we have a

166
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,800
usb or hard usb drive

167
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
and this intermediary

168
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,199
hardware device

169
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
on the flash drive there may be some

170
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
obfuscated viruses and a boot sector

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
but

172
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,560
this device recognizes only fat32

173
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
there is no

174
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
boot sector running everything that had

175
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,680
been created to automatically run

176
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,479
would

177
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,680
not run

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
because for this device it would be just

179
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,479
a

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,479
number of bytes

181
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
that it would read

182
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
and check without running

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,520
if we

184
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,719
boot it from a device

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
this intermediary device only knows fat

186
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,360
32 file system nothing else will launch

187
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
and the modem if we smuggle modem and

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
plug it to this device it will not

189
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
recognize it if we plug in a phone for

190
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
charging you'll get your 5 volts

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
not the right amperage but it will

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,639
somehow charge it but no malicious files

193
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
will penetrate

194
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
at all

195
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
so the implementation of this solution

196
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,679
the emulation of the flash drive which

197
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,360
is formatted to fat 16

198
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,919
so we emulate

199
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,320
this to fat 16 even if the drive is in

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
fat 32

201
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,080
it is read only so data leakage is not

202
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
possible so it's a direct gateway for

203
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
usb but of course we have all of the

204
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,240
deficiencies of fat16 we cannot use

205
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
cyrillic

206
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,680
names and the length

207
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680
of the file is 8 bytes plus 3 bytes for

208
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
expansion

209
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,600
and the maximum size is only four

210
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
gigabytes so usb drives are not

211
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
supported

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,160
as for other disadvantages i should say

213
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,839
that

214
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
if we have cyrillic in the names

215
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,800
this file will not read but if it's a

216
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
longer file than 8x3 it will be just

217
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
shortened to 8x3

218
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
and it will still

219
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,000
found so it's not a problem and the

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
updates do not take too much space for

221
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
gigs it's just an image of operating

222
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,640
system but people would not normally

223
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
download such things on usb drives

224
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120
hardware-wise it's a sandwich from two

225
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
circuit boards the third first one

226
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
checks the files

227
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,920
from the usb flash drive verifies them

228
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
sends it to the second device and

229
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,880
emulates this flash drive on a pc and

230
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
executes the allowed files

231
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
there are two

232
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
such circuit boards just one usb port is

233
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
required hardware wise

234
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
no drivers are required no additional

235
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,959
power is required just a regular usb

236
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,800
port with five volts

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,839
power how do we filter the files

238
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
we handled the viruses we handled bad

239
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
usb drives but how do we filter the

240
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,440
files and what policies do we use here

241
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
simple policies can be used here by

242
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
filtering by name or part of the name

243
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
of the catalog

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
the path

245
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
the expansion

246
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
but these things are not that

247
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,680
interesting for hackers hackers can

248
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
easily bypass

249
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,480
such limitations so these policies are

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
helpful for admins to put it in the

251
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,160
catalog

252
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,839
to administer

253
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,720
things and manage these things easier

254
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
but we can also

255
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
get hash allowances hash files and we

256
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
can analyze the first and bytes to

257
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
define the type of a file

258
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,839
and

259
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,279
if the file doesn't match any of such

260
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,040
criteria it will not be just

261
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
shown on our emulated usb drive how do

262
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
we verify the type of a file for the

263
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
first n bytes we have heard some

264
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,480
presentations regarding that topic

265
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,519
we use magic numbers

266
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,800
we define

267
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
that for

268
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
first and bytes there are some

269
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
combinations

270
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,519
for n-files

271
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
and bytes

272
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
yesterday we had a presentation about

273
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
how to forge

274
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,040
a pdf file on a python script and that

275
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,760
will be shown as pdf to eradicate that

276
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,839
we can

277
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,480
use

278
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
the selection of the first bytes so that

279
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
we are not limited by standards so here

280
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,440
is

281
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
standard bytes

282
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,160
like it was shown on the first slide

283
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,000
and the user can on their own at the

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,480
bytes if needed

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,839
to extend the protection and make it

286
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
more complicated uh for the fraudster

287
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,200
this is the editor of policies uh first

288
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
of all we read here the most difficult

289
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,720
policy then it checks and verify it

290
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,519
versus the catalog and by

291
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,240
name of the file so if the file or the

292
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
catalog matches the first criteria all

293
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,120
the other ones are not applied here and

294
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
it has the allowance if it doesn't match

295
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
with anything

296
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
it's not allowed

297
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,079
then we keep these policies and how do

298
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,880
we send it to the device

299
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,079
it is sent in in an encrypted file which

300
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,800
is written on a usb drive and on the

301
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,600
device we have jumpers we have 64

302
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,639
options of putting the jumpers

303
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,760
we set the code the device goes to the

304
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
service mode

305
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,000
this file reads and

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,959
decrypted and all of the policies are

307
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,440
stored in the

308
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,920
flash memory

309
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,880
please speak closer to the microphone i

310
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
will thank you

311
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
later i would like to

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
play a video to run my demo

313
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
okay

314
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,839
if i speak into the microphone and if i

315
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
keep it close i can hear myself too loud

316
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,839
but it's necessary just

317
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
for other guests so i run this demo um

318
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
let's just watch this we plug in the usb

319
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
drive in the computer

320
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,600
we

321
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,880
check the files on it looks like an

322
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,000
ordinary usb drive there are no boot

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,839
sector viruses but some suspicious files

324
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
are there

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
exe files executable files hidden files

326
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
this is what the configurator looks like

327
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
some files are given permission to this

328
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,639
file this file catalog 77

329
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,880
this directory is given permission

330
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
and system 32

331
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
which is a hidden one and

332
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,519
we can't see it here but still it's on

333
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,639
the drive

334
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,120
we plug in the usb device and the device

335
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
has been plugged into the computer

336
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,760
and this is what

337
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,000
it looks like we have

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
two debugging

339
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
solutions and here's our usb drive

340
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,199
we have this

341
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,680
77 folder system one

342
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
mu11 debug and

343
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,760
system32 which is a hidden folder that

344
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,440
we didn't see on the original

345
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
source usb drive but now we can see it

346
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
because it stopped being hidden

347
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,199
let me switch back to my slides

348
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,639
anyway

349
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
that's the device i've described

350
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,600
currently it uses the stm

351
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,240
circuit board we have some issues with

352
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
the hardware apart because

353
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,480
the hardware used there

354
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
is foreign

355
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,839
it was made abroad

356
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
i'm done anyway thank you very much open

357
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,399
for questions

358
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079
hello thank you very much uh ken uh

359
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,519
there's a question

360
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,320
can we upload these policies and rules

361
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,600
remotely

362
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,120
remotely

363
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,800
well it's a question of

364
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,680
using

365
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
the tcp stack it allows

366
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
tcp stack but

367
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
this current solution is a local one but

368
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
it can be updated to match these

369
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
requirements as well

370
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,480
question number two uh but what if the

371
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
user bypasses this device somehow

372
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,079
and plugs in the usb drive directly

373
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,759
but that's the

374
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,519
matter of

375
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,639
letting access

376
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
defraudster will not get or the user

377
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,480
will not get access to the device itself

378
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
but they can

379
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,759
somehow

380
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,199
unawarently bring

381
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,039
an infected device

382
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,240
but if the user can unplug such a device

383
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,439
of course

384
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,480
you cannot avoid it

385
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
but

386
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,079
what about

387
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
what about the

388
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,880
usb indicator pid

389
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,918
can we just

390
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,039
link only the particular

391
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
physical device we can harden it and

392
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
tighten it to

393
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,559
the device so we can harden just

394
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,840
one single usb drive and uh not allowed

395
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,480
to plug in any other physical devices

396
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
other usb drives so technically it's

397
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
possible to do exactly

398
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,679
thank you uh seems like that it's the

399
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
one and the device we

400
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,080
ending yet another protection device uh

401
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
one computer one device but what if we

402
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,520
scale it up with a thousand pcs

403
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
will you be plugging usb drives to a

404
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
thousand computers not really because in

405
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
a closed environment we just have a few

406
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,160
pcs but i imagine a a user comes up with

407
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
a flash drive and to upload a file

408
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
but i don't think this is how it works

409
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
in a closed environment in a closed

410
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
environment it's all physically checked

411
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,880
what people have brought with them not

412
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,799
every pc

413
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,400
can have this usb drive installed

414
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,559
what about the settings uh for one

415
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,440
device uh all these settings are run

416
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
locally they're not stored for other

417
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
ones for example we have 15 devices and

418
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
you need to

419
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
adjust these settings 15 times

420
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
separately

421
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
for each device we have different

422
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,919
settings

423
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,440
currently but

424
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
there is no problem expending it and

425
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,679
scaling it up if there is a need of

426
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,120
course

427
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,439
thank you

428
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
and one more question which we can't

429
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
hear well

430
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
now we can hear it is it compatible with

431
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
the with the lap with any laptop

432
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,840
a windows based android

433
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,679
device linux based device anything to

434
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,480
personal computers with the usb

435
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,919
connectors

436
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
and laptops with usb connectors

437
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
it can be plugged in as a separate box

438
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
it's a separate black box an

439
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,760
intermediary device it just physically

440
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,840
looks like a black box a small one

441
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
but

442
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
which form factor

443
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
will it have it's just a matter of

444
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,360
personal choice
