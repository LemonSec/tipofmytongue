with investors and how do you become

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,400
interesting to them

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,799
yes kira we have an interesting story of

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
our presence on the stock exchange we

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
are young emission company and not many

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
people knew about us as investors

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,920
because our products are oriented at

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
large corporate clients that's why

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
many people have learned about our

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,759
company when we became first public

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
company in the sector of cyber security

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,720
it was 17th of december right now we

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,560
almost six months five months on the

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
stock exchange and we started entering

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
different selections different ratings

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
selections of the fastest growing rates

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
the ratings of dividend shares and

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
allows to wider share of evidence to

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
learn about us not not only this we want

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
to convey information about our company

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
not only from the point of view finances

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,880
but also from the point of view of how

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
our products working what our business

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,439
does how do we develop our technology of

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,000
fighting with hackers how do we help to

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
keep sustainability of the business

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
state and in the end run we defend not

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,079
only large corporate

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
companies and the state but also the

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,759
data

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,199
well-being money and users and physical

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
entities and this is something that we

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,640
speak about with our investors we tell

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
them how a business works so that they

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,440
would understand which company they

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
invest into and how this company is

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
going to grow in the future

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
and what according to your opinion is it

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
easier to build communications

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,680
after our life have changed

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
significantly in february because

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
according to my feelings positive

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,360
technologies became very important this

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
situation uh

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,640
when colleagues have been discussing

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
previously from one side we see that

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
positive technologies is a import

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
substitution company on the other side

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,599
this is a good perspective of

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
development this is the dividend growth

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
share and it seems that you became one

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
of the beneficiaries of the situation

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
how was it reflected on communications

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
well honestly speaking all the factors

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,040
that you have listed they work in our

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
direction

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
for our benefit and we see these because

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
our investors they have burning eyes and

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,680
when they came to our standoff party

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,360
when they've looked at the replica of

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,640
the city

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,360
with all the infrastructure of our cyber

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
range when you can look at the

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
infrastructure facility facilities which

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,959
are defended by white hackers which are

90
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,280
being attacked by our hacker team which

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
is located under the red color the red

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,040
team so these are real risks which are

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
posing threats to the city to companies

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,519
and to each one of us and when we show

95
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
to our investors this technology of work

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
our company works and what it depends

97
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,319
from they are they understand it but

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,920
this is one of the elements how we work

99
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
with investors truthfully our work is

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,959
built in a wide spectrum of channels and

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
we're trying to be maximally open

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
and transparent and our investors they

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
value these and they see that demand uh

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
coming from our investors active and

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
potential ones is very high we provide

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
information in a wide sense of channels

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
we constantly have online

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,599
meetings and we tell people about our

109
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
company communications have not changed

110
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,799
since the very beginning we've been

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,319
trying to be a maximally transparent

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
company and right now we'd like to add

113
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,560
the following what has changed right now

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
in principle on the market many

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,040
companies became and started using uh

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,639
the benefits from the legislation they

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
reduced the amounts of open information

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
they hide some financial reporting but

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
we vice versa we

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
uh make our activities more transparent

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
so that people would understand our

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
financials and drug drivers and how our

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,639
business is going to develop in the

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
future so we are saying that we're not

125
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,240
going to limit disclosure of the

126
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
information the main driver for us is

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
this and the current event the investor

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
day for positive holidays allows our

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
investors for the first time after our

130
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
placement in the market come to us and

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,240
see obviously with their own eyes how

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,320
our team works what do we protect them

133
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,479
from and which risks could be carried by

134
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,960
hackers for each one of us

135
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
thank you very much you just uh

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
preceded my question do you plan to use

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
this trend that we see on a stock

138
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
exchange and this is wonderful that you

139
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,639
stay open i have another question

140
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360
what do you think how your team thinks

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,479
about

142
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,199
how usual retail investor really

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
understands what your company does

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
positive technologies maybe you have

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
some additional plans to become even

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
more understandable for the person

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,440
who has no knowledge about i.t and has

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
no expertise and maybe he didn't play

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
any video games but maybe he just heard

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
that there's a cyber security and it's

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,039
promising

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,479
well our first investors were people who

153
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
believed in our business believed in our

154
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,720
company were people who have experience

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,400
in i.t and informational security

156
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
because for them this business and this

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
direction is understandable and has

158
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,639
practical application in their life and

159
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,560
in their work our main objective since

160
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
the very beginning was to convey the

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
information to wider circle of investors

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,319
we are using different forms of

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
conveying this information starting from

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
sharing in our channels cyber security

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
news we tell people about

166
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,720
which facilities were attacked by

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
hackers uh it was reflected in lives of

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,680
regular citizens we tell them how our

169
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
competitors work we tell them about

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,479
which support measures are applied by

171
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,160
the state to our industry and we do see

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
that these uh

173
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,759
multifaceted approach to cyber security

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,440
news

175
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
allows us to show more full information

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,039
what are we going to do in the future in

177
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,880
the future we will make more

178
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
communication

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
open communications about our products

180
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,960
we know that in our portfolio we have 15

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
products and more even more solutions

182
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,199
but honestly speaking our products are

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
oriented for large clients and that's

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,560
why

185
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,160
these products

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,599
are not really accessible and not

187
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,360
understandable by our private clients

188
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
and private investors that's why we are

189
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
going to speak about them more openly

190
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
and open examples and the first step in

191
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
this direction will be the fact that we

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
have placed on our site for investors

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
group security.com our first public

194
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,919
annual report and in this report we've

195
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
been openly speaking in a common

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
language about our products about our

197
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
businesses about how do we work and how

198
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
did we build the cyber security system

199
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
and system of protection of the it

200
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
counter of the company and we do hope

201
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
that this report will be the first step

202
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
in this direction our investors will be

203
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,319
able to learn about it in all

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,560
communication channels and i hope that

205
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,919
in the future we will be able to make

206
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,160
this practice constant and continuous

207
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,599
and i believe that this report will be

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
highly demanded by our investors and

209
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
possibly will become one of the best uh

210
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
annual reports this year well this is a

211
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,039
great approach and thank you very much i

212
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,840
have another question do you have an

213
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,240
opportunity to speak more about large

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
clients of course it's understandable

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,199
that

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,360
you are bound by certain limitations

217
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
which are available in your client

218
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
agreements but uh do have an option of

219
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,319
developing this because this would make

220
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
you even more understandable for a wide

221
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
audience uh who uses your products why

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
do you they use this product etc yes of

223
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,479
course i do agree with you that this

224
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
case study

225
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
is the most interesting one and uh the

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
uh most viable for the perception of the

227
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
wide audience well basically speaking

228
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
speaking about our client base our

229
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
clients uh even before the events of the

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
previous year were 80 of the largest

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
companies of russia which are amongst

232
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
the expert 400 companies and right now

233
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
we see that this is 90 of those

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
companies so if you will call any big

235
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
company in the russian market most

236
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039

257
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
what do you think uh whose account the

258
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
shareholding base is going to grow

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
from the point of view of usher holding

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
base well honestly our shareholding base

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
is growing with the high rates and we've

262
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
been coming to this dot exchange by

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
direct listing when our first

264
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,720
shareholders were those people who

265
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,360
received shares as the remuneration

266
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
these are all employees of the company

267
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
that worked in the company until they

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
before the first november of the last

269
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
year plus 200 people who don't work in

270
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
the company but they have introduced

271
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,600
their input in the development of our

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,399
business our products and technologies

273
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
after this we were able to see that in

274
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
10 days 10 days of trade sessions at

275
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,839
moscow stock exchange until the end of

276
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,399
december our new investors were 10 000

277
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,200
shareholders uh also in one month it was

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
20 000 right now there are more than 45

279
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,279
000 people and 99.9

280
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,079
of them are private people we all know

281
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:06,880
that

282
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
retail investors and private entities

283
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,839
right now this is the main force of the

284
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,079
growth of our stock exchange

285
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
and we have been looking at them that

286
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
this will be our key shareholding base

287
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
and this is what happened we became more

288
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
understandable to our retail clients of

289
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,839
retail investors and we are going to

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
move in this direction as well and we

291
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,040
will attract wider audiences of

292
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,519
investors today we are going to conduct

293
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,399
investor day at 6 30 p.m we are going to

294
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,760
tell about our ambitious plans to

295
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
attract shareholders but i will

296
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,720
immediately tell you that those goals

297
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
that we had ahead of us for example

298
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,880
hundred thousand shareholders this year

299
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,920
uh they don't look such uh unbelievable

300
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
they are even lower than we hope because

301
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,600
demand for our services and for our

302
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,160
shares as a company which is located in

303
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
the top of the wave is very high but

304
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
undoubtedly we're not saying that we

305
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
will limit ourselves just uh private

306
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
investors of course we will attract or

307
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
to our capital big funds as well we do

308
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,399
understand that availability of big

309
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,519
funds uh in our shareholders is also a

310
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
good quality side it's understandable

311
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,680
that right now we are not speaking about

312
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,279
attracting foreign investors but big

313
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,600
russian investors are interested in our

314
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
company and please believe us we do work

315
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
in this direction and honestly speaking

316
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,200
we are interested so that our shares

317
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
would be interesting to retail investors

318
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
and large institutional investors who

319
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
can make them even more interesting

320
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,160
traded and liquidity

322
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,640
would like to ask you another question

323
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880

324
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,279
involve shareholders in the life of the

325
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920

this is a key event for our investors

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
five months we've been on the stock

332

time those who own the shares of the

334

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
power and necessity of cyber security

336
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,160
then in future we'll conduct a number of

337
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,279

338
