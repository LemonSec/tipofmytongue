1
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,600
let's discuss in the beginning the

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
importance of the clouds in our current

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,279
conditions

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,680
because from one side a cloud gives the

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
conveniences and on the other side

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,680
we had those events which somehow could

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
influence or maybe they didn't change

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,360
their perception of people to the cloud

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,680
well honestly speaking after this new

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
era has come after the february 21st

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
24th of this year and the perception of

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,079
people of the clouds became more intense

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
because a number of events happened when

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
people using clouds of

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,239
western companies

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
and not only clouds but also placement

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,760
of some virtual resources in this class

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,640
[Music]

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,200
were cut away from them

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,920
the

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,040
iron

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
wall has been turned off they're data

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,759
they've got a lot of businesses medium

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,600
and small businesses

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,159
and they've stayed with nothing

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
because of these so we do people do

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
carefully look at these clouds but the

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
world is changing the volumes of

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
information that we are looking at is

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
growing geometrically

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
if 20 years ago 25 years ago my

32
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,240
personal computer was looking like top

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
the best but right now mobile phone

34
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
which has much more possibilities is not

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
sufficient to me for storage of the

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
information processing of this

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,439
information

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
so the option of buying yourself

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,479
constantly the hardware upgrading this

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
hardware changing this hardware

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
it's a dead-end situation but hardware

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
is always produced uh new and uh cloud

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
technologies are very important cloud

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,680
providers are very important when from

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,759
trusted locations you can request those

46
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
resources that you need today

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,280
trusted places for us are only those

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
things which are located in the

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
territory of our country and right now

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
if previously there were certain risks

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
that state authorities will come they

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,239
will try to take it away from you

53
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,840
right now

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
there are no possibilities of getting

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
something from the west so these risks

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,879
are becoming secondary

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,440
have expectations of people

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,120
changed to cloud infrastructure or cloud

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,000
services in recent months

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,720
expectations have not changed because

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,159
people want to consume resources

62
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
people need to fulfill their objectives

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,760
but to fulfill them they need resources

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
so no expectations have not changed

65
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
but

66
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
we are visiting positive positive hot

67
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,360
days and uh

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
in all means of mass information and to

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
all the channels we regularly see

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
the different resources different clouds

71
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,760
located in cloud infrastructures and

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
they're being attacked and we have a

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,959
question

74
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,840
and we have to be defended and right now

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
in the russian market we have only

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
positive whose products can be used for

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
this purpose

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
yes thank you very much for your opinion

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
but speaking about specialized cloud

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,319
infrastructure what is it specialized

81
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
cloud infrastructure is a concept

82
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,480
which allows published

83
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
build cloud solutions

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
which

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,439
solve business objectives the most

86
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
valuable thing that we have because we

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,159
all are living people and the resource

88
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
is completed irrespective of the fact

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,560
that we miss some time some money some

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
hardware but you will not replace and

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
replenish determined in the

92
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,560
moment when you try to solve the

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
objectives

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
or where to buy and you can buy it yeah

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
you can buy it separately but it's very

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,918
complicated quest

97
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
for business

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,199
well you're not solving business

99
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
objectives as the owner of the business

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
and earning money

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
that's why

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
specialized cloud infrastructure is a

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
concept

104
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
which allows you to get advantages of

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
public clouds and private clouds

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
public clouds

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
what is the advantage uh significant

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,199
advantage of public clouds is the

109
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
horizontal scalability if you need

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
something

111
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
it's very simple and easy can be pulled

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
around those resources that you consume

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
plus

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
a story which is related that from the

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
cloud you can receive services i don't

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
know software as a services platform as

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
a service but you receive services you

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
don't implement them on your platform

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,240
but what's so good in uh clouds and

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
public and clouds and clients don't like

121
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
some things in the clouds and they don't

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,000
like

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
that they don't have transparency

124
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,960
from the point of view of storing

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
information from the point of view of

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
how information is moving where this

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
information is located who has access

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
who doesn't have the access

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
provider declare

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
and all the providers are declaring that

131
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,479
everything's all right we are protected

132
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,960
but these are risks which exist and

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
which can

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
exist and they can work and they may not

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
work

136
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
but there's another extremity it's a

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
private cloud when you are in-house in

138
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
your own perimeter

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
you're protected from physical security

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
information security and how do you

141
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
build the cloud you get all the

142
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
advantages which you don't have in the

143
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
public you don't understand what is the

144
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
information where's the access who is

145
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
doesn't have this access but there's

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
another problem if you will look at

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,440
public clouds

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
100

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
scalability

150
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
the private cloud is also scalable

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
however first of all you are closing

152
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
your hardware which you have already

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
purchased and how did you tune it up for

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
the current processes and the second

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
story when you make the private cloud

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
you invest a lot of money you have a big

157
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
capex you want to do it once and for all

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
and usually it comes to an end

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
it ends in two three yes and the

160
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
solution that you've had previously

161
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,800
yesterday today does not correspond to

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
your current needs

163
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
but specialized cloud infrastructure is

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
a concept which combines pluses with

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
scalability and this is methodology and

166
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
practice of building cloud solutions

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
not virtualization of current resources

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
but cloud solution which includes

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
all aspects related with scalability

170
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,639
movement

171
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,919
adding of computing capacities etc

172
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
by the way let's speak about the

173
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,759
hardware you've mentioned

174
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,120
hardware which is currently

175
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
limited and there are some

176
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
significant limitations and big deficit

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
and the longer it's going to happen the

178
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
more deficit will have and obviously

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,479
clouds

180
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
will be able to solve this problem to

181
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,680
decline

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
do you see

183
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
that client understands

184
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,919
the role of the cloud as a solution of

185
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
problem of the absence of the hardware

186
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,639
or the client wants to build his own

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,599
clouds and his own hardware

188
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,520
well we have to separate this problem

189
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
and it does exist on the russian market

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,759
hardware disappeared

191
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,160
just yesterday before yesterday there

192
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
was a research published that even china

193
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
has cut away uh telecom supplies by 90

194
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,199
percent

195
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
so we don't have in our country we don't

196
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
have uh uh well for those users who live

197
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,638
here who work here

198
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,639
and we are trying to do something good

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,520
for our country and there is no

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
possibility to buy hardware and which

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
aspects do we have in here yes we do

202
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
have some hardware

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
which uh

204
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
should be fixed for extended period of

205
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
time but we should understand how well

206
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,279
it is utilized how well it is used and

207
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,880
what is to be done with it in the future

208
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,479
and the second aspect as you probably

209
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,599
said is a supply of new hardware cloud

210
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,279
solutions and the main idea of these

211
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,080
cloud solutions where is it

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
that users above they consume resources

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
uh software time

214
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,839
hardware and what

215
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,040
at the bottom they shouldn't be

216
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
interested in it

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
and properly build cloud solution

218
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
is by which poles of italia

219
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,519
removes from the user attention to those

220
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,279
resources he consumes for example peace

221
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
has dropped away

222
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
and you've pulled new hardware

223
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,880
and then it has been used and the user

224
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,560
have not noticed it and in connection

225
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
with this

226
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,279
cloud solution which is failed on the

227
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,800
basis of this concept that we have been

228
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
declaring the one that has been offered

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
to us

230
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
because the user shouldn't think

231
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720
user shouldn't

232
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,680
fail some lack of resources

233
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
they shouldn't spend their time for the

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,360
purchase because they probably correctly

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
build cloud solution is not a box you

236
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
cannot take it and put it inside if you

237
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
have nothing

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
yes you can take software hardware

239
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,600
complex it works it stays here and it

240
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
will cover your needs for a certain

241
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
period of time

242
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,120
but a solution that must work it should

243
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
remove this problem from the user

244
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,519
completely and it changes processes so

245
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
if today

246
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
the process of purchasing new hardware

247
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
without taking consideration this new

248
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
ebook

249
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
you know you need to look what do you

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,839
need you need to select existing

251
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,399
manufacturers you can look at the prices

252
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
and this is a process it used to take

253
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
from four to eight weeks

254
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
it's a lot and you need to solve this

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
problem today maybe tomorrow but they

256
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
telling you well in eight months

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
you

258
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,610
[Music]

259
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
you buy from the provider these

260
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
resources

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
they're going to properly build

262
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
solutions

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
like for example you need ten times more

264
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,000
okay one tomorrow yes

265
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,549
[Music]

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,279
so you guarantee that after there will

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,079
be availability of this hardware well if

268
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
it's so attractive and interesting

269
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,480
we want to understand

270
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
how densely is populated this cloud

271
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
market and what is the role of your

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
company on this market

273
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,680
the cloud market

274
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,440
we speak about yesterday no let's speak

275
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,200
about today was if we're speaking about

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
yesterday but the cloud market was

277
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,480
really occupied because

278
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,920
it's not too

279
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,160
significant part of our market was taken

280
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
by western providers where the data was

281
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
stored but right now it's a new era and

282
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,639
the market became more free

283
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
and there's a lot of companies

284
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
everybody they're not just they have not

285
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,680
just lost an opportunity

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
to build clouds

287
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
in-house or bring part of their

288
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,440
infrastructure somewhere to the bus but

289
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,880
they have lost an opportunity

290
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,079
to acquire resources we cannot buy it so

291
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,959
i think that the market

292
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,880
will grow

293
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
very fast and everybody are going to

294
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,560
look because the budgets are being held

295
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
and

296
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
they are growing exponentially and this

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,959
is highly demanded today the market is

298
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,200
going to drop

299
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
and

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,000
in the nearest two three in the end of

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
the year there's going to be a growth

302
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,880
because nobody has removed those

303
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
objectives you cannot do it for somebody

304
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
else but the role of your company in the

305
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
market

306
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
and how's it different from other

307
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
solutions

308
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
the role of my company

309
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
the role of our company we came out of

310
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
international companies

311
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
we came out of big russian integrators

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
and

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
we have collected a team of experts

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
which have built dozens of complicated

315
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,639
computing capacities in the beginning

316
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,760
and

317
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
recently very complicated cloud

318
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,710
solutions as well

319
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,399
[Music]

320
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,120
we

321
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
are stating that we have to follow the

322
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
business needs of the client and we have

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,959
to solve those needs which clients have

324
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,760
we are not limited

325
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,839
by the fact that we are having some

326
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
complete box solution software hardware

327
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,120
solution and we have no objective of

328
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
pulling on top of this solution on top

329
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
of these complex problems of the client

330
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,120
so we can say

331
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
the public

332
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,839
cloud with a beautiful nice

333
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,720
face so this is something that is

334
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
missing in the market

335
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
so in a previous profile we've been

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,519
buying some resources so you come to

337
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
public and they tell you okay go to the

338
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
store and buy it but well i don't want

339
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
it

340
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,600
i need to solve my problem i want my

341
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
system not to

342
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
drop i want to buy yeah private cloud

343
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
okay

344
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,440
thank you very much

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
we have purchased it okay wonderful but

346
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,880
you know we have changed the objective

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
and it doesn't work so in order to avoid

348
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,959
it

349
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
we are moving in the direction of

350
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
helping our client and our expertise

351
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,240
helps us in doing this

352
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
and we are proud we are happy

353
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,480
so we are friends of people

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,760
who have been involved in the

355
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
development of heavy complicated systems

356
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
for different gaming gaming

357
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,920
manufacturers

358
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,440
and developers and right now we can use

359
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
their experience and knowledge and apply

360
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
this knowledge to solve the

361
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
problems of the clients and also it is

362
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,600
very important to understand where the

363
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,120
data is being stored in your case all

364
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
the data is stored where

365
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,639
in russian data centers

366
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
different russian data centers

367
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,639
we look at clients needs and on the

368
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
stage of initial discussion what they

369
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
want

370
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
they discuss what do they want it

371
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,839
if they don't have any criminal desires

372
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,240
tough requirements we have data centers

373
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
of partners where we have been placed

374
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
and we provide our services from there

375
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
and some clients they say we want it

376
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
there we say okay we understand you we

377
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
are friends with you we started agreeing

378
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,759
how it's going to be like there yeah

379
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,759
so that client

380
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,560
wouldn't think about what they need how

381
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,040
they need etc etc

382
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
but why

383
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,199
specialized cloud infrastructure is

384
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,360
important now

385
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,800
as we've told you previously there is no

386
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
hardware current hardware should be

387
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,759
utilized

388
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,600
resources will be demanded

389
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
and declined

390
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
at a certain moment of time you will

391
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,800
have to bring some of your needs and

392
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,839
business objectives in the

393
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,680
cloud and very often what's happening

394
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
like i have a system and i have some

395
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,040
resources additional resources which i

396
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,000
inbuilt in my system i need expertise i

397
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
need people who understand how it's

398
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
going to leave so we offer you to move

399
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
in another direction we suggest

400
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,320
that we need to build a cloud next to

401
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
you and cover

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
all of these with an

403
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
umbrella

404
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
you build a solution next door next door

405
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,199
solution yeah yesterday i would say

406
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,519
let's replace it but today we say we

407
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
have a hardware it's going to work for

408
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,720
certain periods but what is important if

409
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
your hardware is going to break you're

410
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
not going to have discontinuation of

411
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
your services okay let's do it in the

412
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,360
following way

413
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
in this data center we will properly

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,279
build the

415
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
hardware yes it's open

416
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,160
openstack kvm russian not russian

417
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
whatever however additionally to these

418
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,559
things that you have will be covered and

419
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,319
supported by

420
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
the lower level of the hardware and

421
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
these resources well if it's going if

422
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,559
your server is going to break well god

423
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,039
forbid but this resource it will be

424
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,240
provided to you

425
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,079
so i properly understand it happens that

426
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,359
for every client you do your own

427
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
configuration of the cloud solution you

428
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
don't have you know okay guys we are

429
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
going to put you in a certain box

430
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,559
well i'm against box solutions i'm

431
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
against box solutions

432
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
not because they are bad

433
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,520
box solution always solves one standard

434
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
objective which everybody might have

435
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
but if you want a box you can get a box

436
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,919
and we have russian developers you can

437
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
go to them you can buy a box

438
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,840
but we are saying that we are solving

439
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,320
clients problems we do what client needs

440
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
and there's an example one s

441
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
you can buy box solution and here it is

442
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
it's available

443
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,919
but more than half of people are

444
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
completing this box because they have

445
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
totally different needs um well it's a

446
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,760
russian community main system russian

447
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
system

448
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
and a fun question that i have to you

449
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
know which

450
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,880
goals usually clients come to you with

451
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
which problems they want to solve with

452
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,160
the help of your solutions top three

453
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,679
well

454
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,559
cost reduction current cost reduction

455
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,039
this other way

456
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,720
it because costs mean people it's

457
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
expertise

458
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,120
and

459
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
right now

460
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,720
expert even in this new era can work

461
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,720
globally

462
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,080
today is the absence of their hardware

463
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
and client through his procedure can buy

464
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,679
only new

465
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,720
nowhere

466
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,799
when you

467
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,160
and where he is

468
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,400
certain peculiarities that new hardware

469
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,919
is being investigated and uh

470
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,160
used one is not in it yet and number

471
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
three

472
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,039
it's always transferring the

473
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
responsibility in one case

474
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
client is responsible for everything

475
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,679
how does it work how is it being spent

476
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,440
and if something is being broken it

477
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
comes to him so he shares his

478
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,160
responsibility

479
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
and

480
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,280
in addition to sharing it

481
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
you know your ass is closer to you

482
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
and there's a psychological moment that

483
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
you can

484
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,919
rebuke somebody

485
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
so the transfer of this

486
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,520
responsibility to the side

487
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
relax has declined and he feels a little

488
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
bit lighter but at the same time

489
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
releasing yourself from part of

490
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,559
responsibility he releases his time

491
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
for more productive activities which he

492
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,799
can do

493
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
and which is going to bring his company

494
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
more benefits and more money thank you

495
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,679
very much love yes cloud solutions

496
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,200
have very big specifics in russia

497
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,559
and in previous realities cloud

498
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,240
solutions were perceived very

499
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
skeptically even though in some sense

500
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,120
they were uh proliferated

501
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,000
first of all these were most popular

502
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
foreign solutions but right now

503
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,799
possibilities of using and not even

504
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,960
possibilities but a desire of using

505
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
foreign clouds

506
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,080
there is no such desire and a question

507
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,320
of hardware the question of the absence

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
of hardware the

509
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,919
question of flexibility the question of

510
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,810
uh scalability

511
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,039
[Music]

512
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,080
it has to be solved

513
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
and the faster it's being done the

514
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,240
better it is and cloud solutions trusted

515
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,600
