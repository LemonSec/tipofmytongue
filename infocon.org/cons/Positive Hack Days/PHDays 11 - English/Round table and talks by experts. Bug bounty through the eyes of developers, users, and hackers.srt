00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,359
dear participants good afternoon i am

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,080
happy to welcome you here at our round

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,480
table i am dmitry kuziwanov i am

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
technical director of asbo of course i'm

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,440
going to moderate this round table

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,240
the topic of our round table is bug

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,279
bounty

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
the view of developers users and hackers

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
i would like to introduce to you uh the

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
participants yaroslav babin from

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,080
positive technologies lucas afano

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
from sinclait alex aggression uh from vk

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,479
group

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,600
of vladimir

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,960
minister of digital development russian

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,399
federation

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,680
rambler

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,360
anton routine

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,719
and he bought

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
and you gain evolution from byzantine

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,680
uh to start a panel discussion

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,079
uh i'd like to ask a simple question it

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,480
is seemingly simple but in fact it's

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
quite

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
complicated it's regarding the launch of

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,879
the bug bounty program

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,280
how to understand

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,239
that

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,000
it's time to start a bug bounty

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
i think

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,439
alex segreson will be the right man to

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,799
take this question

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,400
no

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
well in the first place we're launching

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
a bug bounty when we already have

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
an information security a process

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
structured and installed unless we have

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,479
a security a no bug boundary will help

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,200
us

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,759
bug bounty it's not only about bugs

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,640
it's the story that allows you to

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,079
identify

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
what goes wrong in your is

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
processes where you didn't set up the

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
firewalls correctly where you forgot to

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
install the patches

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
to update something where you have some

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,439
more difficult problems bug mount is

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,079
going to be a marker and this marker is

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,200
going to run

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
7 365 the crowd community will

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
continuously look for holes in your

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
systems highlight them and you'll be

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
fixing them and here again you need to

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
have a process that will allow you to do

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
it promptly

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
cleanly and so that

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
the research communities should not to

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,160
be offended so that you should pay them

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,520
out in time and recognize their efforts

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,040
if

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,280
you don't yet have any processes and you

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,599
would like to start bug bounty

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,000
uh in most likelihoods it's not going to

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
give you any result yes you will

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,879
understand

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
from which side there are more attacks

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
but once you strengthen

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
the security they'll start picking you

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
from other sides so bug bounty is a

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
process for mature companies

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
can i add something

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,959
in fact i agree

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,920
and

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,280
this

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,480
statement

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
has been true for

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
many years but now in the last few years

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
companies that left

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
this market such as hacker once and

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
others

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
they started

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
to launch programs where the level of

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,879
maturity was quite low

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,920
if we take a bug bounty our program five

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,519
years ago indeed everything was dropping

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,040
with the kiwi started bug bounty and the

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,959
first a year and a half

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,599
they started triage the first bugs now i

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,560
think

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,599
uh bounty can be launched by practically

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
any companies it's very popular in the

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
b2c segment

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
so the important thing is to approach it

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,760
with

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,120
ingenuity

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
not to expose your entire infrastructure

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
expose just a little bit

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,159
uh make it closed

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,720
uh ask the

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,440
site to limit the number of participants

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
and

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
reach an agreement with the uh platform

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
so the primary triage should be applied

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
so uh in this case we were just

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,959
replacing classic pen test uh by an

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,360
independent assessment if you approach

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,239
it

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,439
uh

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,640
reasonably you can even take not

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,159
a super uh mature company with thousands

112
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
of panthers behind

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
so you can actually launch

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
by any company

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,279
i would like to add

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
on the one hand of course

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,400
you can launch a bug bounty immediately

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
but

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
even though we're being assured that the

120
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
platform can provide bug filtration and

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
other things until you have

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
working opsec

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
while you don't have a team

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,199
who can work with this bug you don't

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,639
understand how this process is

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
structured you can really drown them yes

127
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
in principle yes if you have only one

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
product on the perimeter if you have

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
if you have only one service you could

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
but on the whole i would rather agree

131
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
that it's not just about

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
ies processes opsec should be in place

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
you should understand how development

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
works is working in your organization

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
how you work with the developers

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
to understand what you want to get from

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,199
this program not just we have something

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
on the perimeter let's ask people to

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,039
find something

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,039
this is going to be too difficult in

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
terms of

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
both closing and confirming unless you

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,000
have any ready-made processes so yeah

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you can start immediately perhaps but on

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
the whole i think bug bounty

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
comes after some upset process not just

147
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
yes but upset process

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
thank you

149
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
anton

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,440
for instant telegram they don't have

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,759
processes opsec they don't have security

152
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
people but they live quite well without

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,560
that yes they have just one product but

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
it's big and vast and they don't have a

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
lot of people it's just as a case to

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,039
to oppose what you just said

157
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
uh but we'll come back to that later i'm

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
interested to ask you how does the

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
government understand that it's the time

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,880
to launch bug bounty vladimir will you

161
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,000
answer this question hello

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
on the whole

163
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
historically

164
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
the government as a whole

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,520
has not looked at a bug bounty very

166
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,199
positively we can take a look at bug

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
bounty experience over the previous

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
years in government systems

169
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
it was

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,960
somewhere around zero

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,240
and this didn't happen by chance because

172
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
the risk was very high

173
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,880
we were afraid that the vulnerabilities

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
the triage and fixing

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
because this is a long standing

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
procedure and for government it means

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,759
that

178
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
it should be passed on to subcontractors

179
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
and while we pass it on to them while

180
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,440
this is being fixed why

181
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
should we be sure that the manufacturers

182
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
would not be selling all these things in

183
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,039
the darknet so on the whole we're

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,680
looking at this with some concern the

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
story that happened to all of us on the

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
24th of february changed everything

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
all the infrastructure of our country

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
has become a big test bed and one big

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,199
bug bounty basically is just they're not

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
being reported to us and it's not us who

191
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
are paying them

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
so it's a story that completely changed

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
the concept now

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,440
we are looking in the direction that we

195
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,400
want and we are prepared uh for some uh

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
massive bug bounty initiative including

197
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
uh government information systems

198
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
and here i would rather agree

199
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
with the colleagues from buy zone what

200
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,919
does it mean a mature uh is a processes

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
uh or well-built opsec

202
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,039
in the first place the organization has

203
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,199
to understand that it can fix the code

204
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,160
if it can fix the bugs if it can

205
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,199
uh

206
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,000
check

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,960
cases quite fast

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
to fix them fixing them so this is

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
already a story that you can start with

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,039
then

211
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,280
you just run into battle and

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,639
gradually

213
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,360
you

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
you wouldn't be

215
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
you wouldn't be opening everything over

216
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
the entire infrastructure

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
with access absolutely uh to everyone he

218
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
can run a closed uh bug bounty a closed

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
scope but through this test in battle we

220
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,560
can

221
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
check how it works uh if the expertise

222
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
available to me

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
do my

224
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,960
programmers

225
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,759
know

226
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
about obtained

227
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
kind of

228
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,919
injections

229
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,880
so it turns out that quite soon you'll

230
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,958
be able to find specialists even among

231
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,640
programmers because up to them it's up

232
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,120
to them to fix the code okay i would

233
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
also note

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,080
that companies

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
that launched bug bounty

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,519
should

237
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,800
have enough courage to admit their

238
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,120
mistakes and the courage to disclose

239
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
these mistakes publicly unfortunately

240
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,760
russian companies are practically not

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,080
prepared for that i absolutely agree

242
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
luka is absolutely correct

243
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,080
if we want to radically improve the

244
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
protectedness of civilian infrastructure

245
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
be that gis or state companies or

246
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
commercial structures

247
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
the first thing we need to do

248
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,080
you know this forum has been going on

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
for two days

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
under the auspices of the word social

251
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,440
responsibility but in this case the

252
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
social responsibility would be if you

253
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
made a mistake admit it uh it's the

254
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
story that

255
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
you know they won't come to you tomorrow

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
saying you're fired you know the world

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
has changed

258
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
the government knows perfectly

259
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
the average level of security both in

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
gis and other infrastructures and the

261
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
story where we are hiding at the real

262
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,519
situation from uh each other is not

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
bringing our security higher i

264
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,839
absolutely support what luca said you

265
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
need to support you need to

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,959
admit openly it's more like an honor

267
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,600
dear viewers i suggest that you can

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,399
become

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
participants in this panel discussion uh

270
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
we have a qr code which you can use to

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
enter a group

272
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,880
chat feeds where you can ask a question

273
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,839
and in the meantime uh we are moving

274
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,760
into the topic what you need for a

275
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
successful start

276
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
uh the question before the start

277
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,959
what

278
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
goals

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
does the bug bounty program achieve what

280
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
products you need to research and why

281
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,800
if you take

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
what vladimir has

283
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,480
uh talked about

284
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
from the ministry of digital development

285
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
from the government we don't have a

286
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
mechanism to reward a researcher

287
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
everybody immediately sees some images

288
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,560
with the bottles or something like that

289
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
but in actual fact

290
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
you can indeed

291
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,279
start the work by avoiding some diploma

292
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,640
or something else

293
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
but so far large companies state

294
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
uh cooperation where the processes uh

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
are formal and convoluted uh they

296
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
can't do that they can't even avoid a

297
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,760
hoodie for a vulnerability now a

298
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,560
mechanism uh is appearing so that the

299
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
researcher could come in a show and not

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
bring it to themselves or to

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
the black market

302
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,040
but it should bring the information and

303
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
would get

304
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
some

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
uh you know boons or

306
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,160
his reputation and a booster

307
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
to their reputation

308
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,880
so and so forth so it's becoming an uh

309
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
an exciting process

310
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
this is uh the story uh that we need uh

311
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
that is uh being uh covered by these

312
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,040
platforms i think my colleagues will add

313
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,120
but i think this is the thing that we're

314
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
missing the most now alexis uh what

315
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
uh goals does your uh problem or a

316
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
company

317
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,920
solve by launching uh bug bounty

318
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
what profit do you get

319
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,880
using black bounty we find a lot of

320
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
vulnerabilities that we need to fix

321
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,240
the stream that was coming from hakka

322
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,519
one

323
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,880
was in the first line

324
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
of more than a hundred bugs a week and

325
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
that was absolutely normal we could see

326
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,519
from our services

327
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,120
where the hackers were trying to pick

328
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,839
and

329
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,720
were researching us

330
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,480
we could see the trend for the current

331
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,000
moment

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
we have different scopes that we're

333
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,200
working with

334
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,959
from

335
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,800
the

336
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
computer

337
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,639
applications

338
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,519
installed and user computers such as icq

339
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,959
and all the way to cloud uh platforms uh

340
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,320
such as vkcs here we had quite a lot of

341
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
options to consider

342
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
we started to get an understanding of

343
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,800
which group of researchers is interested

344
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
in which type of applications what

345
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
they're specializing in

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
as

347
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,639
they

348
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,680
did identify certain holes in terms of

349
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,480
bug bounty we even tried an approach

350
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,519
where bug bounty was just a way to

351
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,959
attract uh talent to try them

352
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
as people who could work for us

353
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,800
in addition to bugs as such

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,120
that we fixed in this process

355
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
we were getting information about where

356
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,519
the process

357
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,680
is not tweaked enough

358
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
and the question that was always sold it

359
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,079
was not only how to remove the bug but

360
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,160
also how to make it so that this bug

361
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
shouldn't reappear somewhere else and

362
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,600
how to uh track that these bugs

363
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
should not reappear

364
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,800
the main advantage of a large scope

365
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
and

366
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
of a rich bug boundary

367
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
program was that

368
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
once finding a vulnerability in one

369
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
place it could be verified with no other

370
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,160
applications and closed uh faster

371
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,440
even than a hunter would bring it to you

372
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
and i think a bug bounty is a tool

373
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
that

374
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
allowed us

375
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,519
to run and quench fires

376
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
before they were turning uh

377
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
serious uh our attitudes to critical

378
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199
vulnerability uh was as a real gap

379
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,240
if a bug is brought to you

380
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
so regardless of whether

381
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
it has been exploited or not

382
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
so whether the person would start

383
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
exploiting it themselves or would bring

384
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
it to the black market you close the bug

385
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
which is critical for yourself

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,160
as soon as possible once you can you do

387
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
it and this way

388
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,560
you also provide training for your team

389
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
uh fast it is going to work if you

390
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,360
really get

391
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,560
attacked

392
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
i would like to say uh that bug bounty

393
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
campaigns uh

394
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
allows companies to have a co get in

395
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
touch with researchers there's even a

396
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
thing that could be done before a bug

397
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
bounty it would be absolutely free for

398
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,199
you

399
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
that's just

400
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
a simple placement of security txt file

401
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,680
in the route and every hunter will

402
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
go to this file in the first place and

403
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,760
they will come searching for

404
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
context of security as they will surely

405
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
get their bugs have their reports and

406
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
they will use when you start writing to

407
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
info like in my experience there was a

408
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
case when i was reporting a bug in one

409
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
of the government services so i had to

410
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,839
go through a chain of

411
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,680
specialists to deputy ministers in order

412
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,360
to get to the person

413
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,639
who is

414
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
joining the same chat as myself i just

415
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,680
didn't know that he's responsible for

416
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,079
the security of this resource so had

417
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,720
such as simplest simple things like that

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
being implemented that would have

419
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,320
simplified

420
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
the dialogue between

421
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,759
the owners of the site and researchers

422
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,320
because quite often they just don't know

423
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
where to

424
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
report the

425
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,000
vulnerability found the bug bounty is a

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,680
more mature story because it's about

427
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
money and benefits but the initial

428
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
things that for instance

429
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
did moscow did as implemented

430
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
that

431
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
posted security text txt files and

432
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,639
started to get information about bugs

433
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,440
without any benefits expected also bug

434
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
bounty things offer an opportunity to

435
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,959
decriminalize our youngsters

436
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,360
if they know that they can come to alex

437
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
say report a bug

438
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
to vk services they will get some money

439
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,839
for that but in any event

440
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,639
they

441
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,959
uh their product product is quite good

442
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,680
and they'll be paid well so they won't

443
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,839
have

444
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,160
to you know research the black market

445
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
who could buy this information they

446
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
would not have a need to do that they

447
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
have a real window where they can submit

448
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,079
such information

449
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,600
thank you let's move to the next

450
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
question

451
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,000
what indeed uh is required uh to

452
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,799
successfully start a bug bounty program

453
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,000
and what should we be prepared for after

454
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,240
launch

455
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,439
well look

456
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,480
in fact

457
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,679
all these questions uh stem one from the

458
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,160
other and every time we have to go back

459
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,319
to square one in order to start to

460
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,799
understand the scope

461
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
there are different companies

462
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
uh with state companies uh it's clearer

463
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
if it is

464
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
a government organization uh we know

465
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,559
that it's important we're prepared to

466
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
spend resources but if you're a company

467
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
that has a lot of services in the

468
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
perimeter you first have to prioritize

469
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
proceed from the budget explain to the

470
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
management of why they needed a budget

471
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
like this for these services uh you

472
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
won't be able to do that without

473
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
preliminary preparation

474
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
uh what has been said here that there

475
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,840
are processes where we classify our

476
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,400
assets to understand which of them are

477
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
critical for us and the thing once we've

478
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
understood what's critical for us uh

479
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,160
once

480
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,720
we've gone through that uh sales

481
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,480
once we've seen how we're going to close

482
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,360
that

483
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
we have resources aren't we going to

484
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
 up the sla that we have on our

485
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,360
platform because the developers are just

486
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
not prepared

487
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
to close these vulnerabilities it's just

488
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,240
an additional aspect of opset

489
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480
we have a number of assets the uh

490
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
compromising uh which being compromised

491
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
are an ex oppose an existential threat

492
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
to us and then it's quite easy to

493
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
understand the scope how much money we

494
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
can spend

495
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,799
and

496
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,559
the questions regarding the start the

497
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
launch of the program uh become purely

498
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,400
technical

499
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
uh define uh how we uh define the

500
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
vulnerability or what kind of

501
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
confirmation we need to have

502
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,760
and but once we've gone through all

503
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,160
these stages uh it's not going to work

504
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,880
yes for telegram and for guest

505
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
systems it's easy

506
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
so they have this product everybody

507
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,559
knows uh that's it's critical and

508
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
no will start working but there are

509
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
other type of companies some need this

510
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
process to go through this process to

511
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
understand what's important for them how

512
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,960
they're going to cover that

513
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,200
if they have resources for that and then

514
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,960
it all happens

515
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
as a matter of agreement i don't think

516
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,480
there's a single

517
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,799
uh good approach or where we can which

518
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,918
we can apply anywhere

519
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
i would like to argue with everyone here

520
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,600
i'm sorry actually you don't

521
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
need

522
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
anything to start a bug bounty program

523
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,960
other than open a bug tracker

524
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,799
perhaps you don't even

525
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,720
need to have a budget for that you can

526
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
post a page

527
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
showing i'll show you a way

528
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,840
you can prepare

529
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,799
an attack on our infrastructure allocate

530
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
the scope uh

531
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
assign the top guys

532
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,480
web

533
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,360
2.0 is already there and so somebody i

534
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,880
would be fighting uh for a line in a cv

535
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
i was the first one to bring uh the bug

536
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,080
in

537
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,960
this in itself will be enough for them

538
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,679
uh to start to bring it back uh bugs if

539
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
it's not enough you can award the

540
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,960
t-shirts you know hats then pay some

541
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,520
money so you didn't don't need to hire a

542
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
big team to do a lot of

543
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
okay so they bring us bugs and what

544
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,679
we're going to do with them without

545
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,080
a team well you have bug tracker a bug

546
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,360
tracker

547
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
you can prioritize them as other tasks

548
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,559
for your developers so maybe player tags

549
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,799
are higher if it's critical okay we

550
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,480
don't have an optic processor we can't

551
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
even justify why this one is more

552
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,360
critical than the current task not

553
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
everybody has opsec processes well of

554
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
course not

555
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,799
there are even open source solutions

556
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,200
that have a bug bounty program it's just

557
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
the bug arrives it's closed it's not

558
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
public

559
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
what's what's the name of the company uh

560
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
the jiro that does zero you just get

561
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
inside the bug tracker

562
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
where guys just like yourselves are

563
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,840
writing bugs if there's something

564
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,600
cool then of course

565
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,960
it will be prioritized it'll be fixed

566
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
and if the information was really good

567
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,240
then they'll pay

568
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
most will not be as cool but why not

569
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
start with small

570
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,600
why everybody wants to run like we need

571
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
10 million dollars

572
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
to build everything

573
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
and pay everyone

574
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,919
well it's just my opinion i'm sorry i

575
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,559
would just like to disagree

576
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
that you need to invest a lot to start

577
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,120
bug bounty well as a minimum

578
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
you should be able to fix those

579
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
vulnerabilities and just accepting bugs

580
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,640
is not enough perhaps because

581
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,840
the goal of bug bounty on the one hand

582
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,360
is an independent audit by a large

583
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,880
number of researchers but it's not an

584
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
audit for the sake of an audit

585
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,520
look does anybody has a business system

586
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,679
critical for business and or the

587
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,520
organization and at the same time this

588
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
system is not being developed there are

589
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,919
no developers there's no bug tracking

590
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,679
there's nothing so they built it once

591
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,360
and forgot about i

592
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
doubt that one of the key stories is

593
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
that if it's a critical system for the

594
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
organization then one way the other it's

595
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,880
living and which means that there are

596
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,120
at least subcontractors

597
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
maintaining the system which means that

598
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
they

599
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
can be sent a feature or a bug bugs

600
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,039
always happen uh what's the difference

601
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,040
of a bug

602
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,360
[Music]

603
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,159
from

604
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,280
explo

605
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,000
with with exploitation it's to defect

606
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
what the colleagues are saying that of

607
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,280
course we understand that there's a

608
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,200
question of verification it comes up uh

609
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
question questions about triage also

610
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,400
come up

611
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
well this site can take it all but

612
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,960
sometimes

613
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
the vulnerabilities are

614
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
sophisticated complicated you have to

615
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,520
understand them in terms of security

616
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,600
sometimes the

617
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,120
vulnerabilities

618
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
need to be translated correctly but if

619
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
you use

620
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
a third-party site for bug bounty

621
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
everything can be outsourced it's for

622
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,559
commerce i would rather agree with

623
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,880
quality for saying that you don't need a

624
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
lot to start a bug bounty apart from

625
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,720
your desire well i wouldn't agree

626
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,080
uh

627
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,120
just like theater starts with a cloak

628
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,320
room bug bounty starts with the rules if

629
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
you don't have clear rules you're not

630
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,159
going to have

631
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
hunters a good bugs

632
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
hall of fame you should start with

633
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
setting rules you explain to the hunter

634
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,120
this

635
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,320
is the scope that you may touch and here

636
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,120
we

637
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,279
don't attack this is critical and this

638
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,320
is for everyone here

639
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,679
you can

640
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
buy uh reports uh bugs of this kind and

641
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,480
more than that uh once you've

642
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
you found i'll

643
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
publish in the hall of fame and here

644
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,799
i'm not even going to accept information

645
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,960
and the understanding of what exactly

646
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
you are going

647
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
to respond to

648
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
what you are not even going to touch as

649
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
a matter of principle it's what it's

650
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,360
going to start with so in principle yes

651
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,480
the page with rules is something that

652
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
should be the minimum well hall of fame

653
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,559
is clear if you don't have money

654
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,679
you don't

655
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,559
send t-shirts because uh mailing

656
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,279
t-shirts also cost money uh but at least

657
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,559
so we can add them into the hall of fame

658
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,320
the track is good bugs will get there

659
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,640
but they will die there so

660
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,320
why is that then if your bugs are going

661
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,320
to continuously die within your tracker

662
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
where you open the bug bounty as a

663
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,720
result bug bounty will die as well

664
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,679
you're going to have a tracker with dead

665
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,080
bugs and if

666
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,120
someone gains access to it and the bugs

667
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,039
have not been fixed they will start

668
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
exploiting them so to start playing

669
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
you first agree on this side of the road

670
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,720
with hunters and yourselves what kind of

671
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
rules are you going to play to and only

672
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,480
then to start

673
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,039
yeah i would add here

674
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,600
and i think everybody understands each

675
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
other

676
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,279
but one has to decide here if you have

677
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,080
one product such as telegram a giro

678
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
atlassian something else which is key

679
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
for you and you're prepared

680
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
to process everything coming in about it

681
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
so all vulnerabilities all boss yes no

682
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
doubt you can probably start immediately

683
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,400
start working that same thing with some

684
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,760
government system if you have epgu you

685
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,159
will certainly uh process all that but

686
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,919
if in the perimeter of the company you

687
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
have 20 internet services

688
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
that are maintained by 20 development

689
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,000
teams you first need to somehow sort out

690
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
you

691
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,840
add

692
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
three resources to a private program and

693
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,799
you'll get 100 bugs 90 of which you'll

694
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,080
just

695
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,360
sort out

696
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,159
at

697
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,640
the stage of building your own opsec so

698
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,720
without this process you won't even

699
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
identify the conditions

700
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,640
within which this program is going to

701
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
exist for you how to confirm to which

702
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,279
depth uh and which resources to try in

703
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,600
different situations a different period

704
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,679
to start to launch the program should be

705
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,000
there's no uh one-size-fits-all answer

706
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
what's happening after and what we

707
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,039
should be prepared for

708
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,640
i will support some of the colleagues

709
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,799
that black bounty can indeed

710
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,360
be done anywhere it depends

711
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
on how large your infrastructure is

712
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
imagine you have a 5 000 external

713
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
apps applications the hacker hackers

714
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,279
will come bring bringing you

715
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,559
vulnerabilities what you're going to do

716
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,039
with them if you have one application

717
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,799
five external services what's the

718
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
problem the priority uh would be to fix

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,720
your vulnerabilities uh it's not the big

720
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
team you have if you only have such an

721
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,080
application so there's no problem about

722
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,039
that everything depends uh on the size

723
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,120
uh the hackers will come to you and the

724
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,159
size of your infrastructure super

725
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,600
after the launch

726
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,440
of the program

727
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,559
uh we use some platforms and so there's

728
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,840
one question

729
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,960
how do you split responsibilities among

730
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,880
between the customers and the platform

731
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
the platform

732
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,600
becomes a guarantor that the

733
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,559
hunter uh will be paid also the platform

734
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,039
i can play the role of an arbiter uh

735
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,960
between the customer the holder and the

736
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,679
hunter because uh many people say that

737
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,440
platforms

738
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
supports the holder rather than the bug

739
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,559
hunter in fact it's not true

740
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
the community and the

741
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,760
bug the community of

742
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,320
bug hunters and holders is not so big

743
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
so everybody knows each other and so uh

744
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,240
if you flipped once uh people will just

745
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
refuse working with you down the road

746
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
it's also a question of honesty and

747
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,240
integrity the platforms don't see a

748
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,840
benefit in

749
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,679
posing in

750
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,960
showing the bug hunter as

751
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,520
an idiot because they will not come back

752
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
to it

753
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,000
and as to the uh customer the holder of

754
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
the program the biggest question is how

755
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,360
fast uh the bugs can be fixed the faster

756
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,000
the customer fixes the boat uh the less

757
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,840
duplication they allow uh the less

758
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,559
uh

759
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,799
unhappiness will they feel from bug

760
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,919
hunters

761
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,720
so if the contact if the

762
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,320
and also there's a question of

763
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,000
generosity

764
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,520
if the customer is not going to pay

765
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,159
according to the market uh standards

766
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,000
people will not be reporting bugs

767
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,440
because people

768
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
value their time and their skills

769
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,760
they're not going to use to do work for

770
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,679
you for peanuts

771
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,080
yes there are bug hunters

772
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
that go

773
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
just like a harvester and report

774
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,320
everything

775
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,600
just to get the money uh in an easy way

776
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
but there are guys have found serious

777
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,600
bugs and also how they help customers to

778
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,679
hide something else which they

779
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,080
themselves have not uh found the

780
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,919
customer will see that and will be able

781
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,840
to highlight some additional problems if

782
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
the customer is open

783
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,840
and

784
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,880
if they

785
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
are willing to talk to bug hunters that

786
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,480
has a big

787
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
probability that they uh will add

788
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,399
something to the

789
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,919
hunter

790
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,880
what the bob hunter found

791
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,320
and there's a great thing there are

792
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,159
great examples from international

793
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,039
practice

794
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
when one of the bug hunters

795
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
uh was taking a bug

796
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
he went to linkedin

797
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,880
he found a repository one of the

798
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
developers and he found some security

799
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,360
tokens there and in one forum platform

800
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
he was paid fifteen thousand dollars he

801
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,520
was surprised why i thought

802
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840
i didn't and they explained to him that

803
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
that was a security token for all

804
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,559
services so basically

805
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,039
he was expecting just a thank you and in

806
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,919
fact

807
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
well uh the uh customer behaved

808
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
uh honestly and paid them and so he uh

809
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,919
well maybe their sum uh was not too high

810
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,279
but again uh by uh showing transparency

811
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,039
in relationship this company has got

812
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,919
more

813
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,039
uh than they would have got if the bug

814
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,159
hunters

815
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
had been unhappy uh selling

816
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,679
in the black market

817
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,000
well i would like to add

818
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,320
uh the market

819
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,960
washing defines

820
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
the price of the bugs

821
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,840
if you announce that you pay fifty

822
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,440
dollars

823
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,640
you'll get

824
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,360
the 50 worth bugs

825
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,600
and no more

826
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
so

827
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,279
do not look what others are doing

828
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,000
you can pay

829
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,320
300 bucks or something dollars or

830
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
something

831
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,000
well

832
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
you cannot

833
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,519
overcome others by

834
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,440
generosity there is a certain threshold

835
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,279
the threshold

836
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,000
and some expectations of the

837
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
hackers

838
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
but they have to

839
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,519
explain about impact some

840
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,840
vulnerabilities are over overvalued

841
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,720
others are undervalued

842
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
but you shouldn't start with paying too

843
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
much

844
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
at the beginning to begin with

845
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,600
and then i wanted to say something else

846
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,720
but i forgot it so let me wait so next

847
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,519
question then

848
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
i

849
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,919
don't agree that there is a fixed price

850
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,720
no

851
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
if we talk about

852
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,799
large services

853
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,200
if bug bounty

854
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
finds something in telegram or facebook

855
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
yes you have you can expect

856
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,279
some prices in darknet but if the

857
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,320
service is critical for you

858
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,279
as a news bulletin for instance the rce

859
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,880
what kind of

860
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
price can it be in darknet but for us it

861
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,640
may be quite critical and we may

862
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
announce our price

863
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,000
and this

864
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
may be even

865
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,320
less than what hacker

866
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,200
explains well he

867
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
crashes our site and asks us to pay 10

868
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,519
million but our business is 7 million

869
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,720
worth i we cannot pay that money

870
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,120
the company must define for itself the

871
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,039
budget that

872
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,039
it is ready to pay for certain

873
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,279
vulnerabilities

874
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,720
evgeny answered my question before i ask

875
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,919
them how to evaluate

876
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,480
in new realities

877
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
pricing

878
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,880
of telegram channels

879
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
became different our

880
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,919
so-called friends

881
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,840
in the foreign bounty platforms pays

882
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,000
bounties for vulnerability of russian

883
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,240
government agencies or socially

884
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,720
important agencies this is one more

885
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,919
channel

886
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,399
a criminal channel and

887
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,280
there is a market where you can sell

888
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,119
vulnerabilities

889
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,839
in root tube for example

890
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,960
well

891
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,359
it may cost that vulnerability which

892
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,320
crashed root tube for several days may

893
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,440
cost

894
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,000
10 or 20 thousand dollars

895
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,079
and

896
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,719
many people would sell that

897
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
vulnerability

898
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,760
to hackers

899
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,599
for some money

900
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,839
we have to be flexible here

901
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
and

902
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,719
as soon as people bring vulnerabilities

903
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,679
to you for a certain price then that is

904
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
the price if they stop

905
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,399
bringing it to you then you have to look

906
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,760
if the

907
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,839
if the price is too

908
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,040
low

909
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,159
and we have to raise

910
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,400
if you raise the price by 50 times then

911
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
it means that the hacker can

912
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,920
spend the time and the effort and get

913
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,400
adequate payment for his time and effort

914
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,839
if

915
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,280
they didn't bring in the bugs

916
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,760
let's raise the price

917
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
then it leads to

918
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,920
overspending

919
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,400
and it doesn't bring in profits because

920
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
some people

921
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,960
sit down with sss and waits until the

922
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,079
price grows by three times and then he

923
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,880
delivers it

924
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,000
paying for impact

925
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
paying for

926
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,520
how

927
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,079
impactful is

928
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,599
the exploit

929
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,119
and pay

930
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,520
not what the market wants

931
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,240
this i think is the right approach for a

932
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,680
certain organization for a certain scope

933
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,000
some

934
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,680
sss can bring in great reputational

935
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
damage

936
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,760
and the company would like to

937
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,119
control

938
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
that kind of affairs

939
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,880
and the

940
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,640
hacker in the dark net

941
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,079
wouldn't

942
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,160
no one would pay anything for that

943
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,560
bug there is no market there in dark net

944
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,520
and the company

945
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,079
would say otherwise it would ready to

946
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,240
pay and sometimes the hacker comes in

947
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,040
and says

948
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,320
well i

949
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,320
took your rcf look at the domain

950
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,000
and

951
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,240
new year

952
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,839
2012 in some

953
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,880
service the

954
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,560
it's nice

955
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,160
that

956
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,640
there is a hole

957
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,560
in an isolated infrastructure

958
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,960
yes in fact

959
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,839
this is an rce

960
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,640
but this is an rce with a zero impact

961
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
or close to zero

962
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,119
well

963
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,760
we have just to tell the

964
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,280
your admin

965
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,359
and that's all

966
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,160
and

967
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,240
there could be no damage

968
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,440
so you must rely on your reliability on

969
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,720
your

970
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,440
requirements on your impact on your

971
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,839
risks

972
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,640
and

973
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,359
pay in according to that

974
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,960
of course if no one brings in the

975
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,079
bugs

976
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,520
you have to

977
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,839
launch events explain to people

978
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,520
that bank bounty works you have to to

979
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,680
carry on pr for bug bounty because the

980
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,119
platform is good and it

981
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,280
is

982
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,000
it can compete very well

983
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,359
with

984
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,480
similar platforms

985
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,359
well

986
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,280
you showed us the recipes

987
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,359
the people who are

988
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,440
in that story for many years

989
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,320
but

990
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,520
many people in this hole

991
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
came to

992
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,839
learn how much is a bug

993
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
we devoted a lot of time you can look

994
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,320
right and left you can evaluate the bug

995
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
yourself or you can come to the

996
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,480
specialist

997
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,760
because

998
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,800
in one organization one bug is critical

999
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,240
in the other

1000
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,839
organization

1001
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,240
it's quite different you can ask the

1002
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
people how much

1003
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,440
could that

1004
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,480
bug cost it's all right

1005
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,480
it can work at the pre-sale level

1006
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,000
in russia no one offers box solutions

1007
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
here everyone is ready to talk everyone

1008
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,599
is ready to consult

1009
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
come ask

1010
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,240
do the job start small

1011
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,320
if no one asks

1012
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,119
or

1013
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,240
well

1014
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,520
raise the price a bit

1015
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,359
then you see some people

1016
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,280
with

1017
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,400
reputation then it's good and you can

1018
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
ask the people you can ask back hunters

1019
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,839
bug

1020
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,079
hunters and you can look right and left

1021
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,560
yourself

1022
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
and

1023
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
you have to have experience

1024
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
to evaluate the price

1025
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,560
and there is a pr

1026
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,200
a question

1027
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,920
what is the minimum budget in

1028
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
for bug bounty to start

1029
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,800

yes

1031
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,280
the question is about the budget the

1032
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
budget for what

1033
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,240
you

1034
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,480
we talked about the profile there is a

1035
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,599
calculation methodology that we use

1036
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,400
in order to evaluate

1037
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,520
and prove

1038
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,440
anticipate how much we're going to spend

1039
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,880
if our price level is this one for

1040
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,920
instance

1041
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,079
it's easy for us because we have a

1042
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,319
multi-year experience

1043
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,000
male rule of kentucky exists

1044
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
more for more than eight years we have

1045
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,880
experience and we understand that if we

1046
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,599
have four rce per year so we need such

1047
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,599
and such money

1048
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,000
but we have to take into account a lot

1049
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
of factors

1050
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,960
which exist in specific application for

1051
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,319
example when you start

1052
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,440
a good rule would be

1053
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,640
to start

1054
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,000
in a closed mode and invite

1055
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,040
certain specific hackers that you know

1056
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,880
that you like that

1057
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,520
are good for you because of some reasons

1058
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,599
they will come to you by all means

1059
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,640
because

1060
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,040
there will be no one but them

1061
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,960
in that platform and there is a big

1062
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,000
chance of

1063
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,880
getting some profit

1064
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,319
and price should be average not higher

1065
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,000
than average after this iteration

1066
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,839
in the close hunting you can open the

1067
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,640
hunting without raising the price

1068
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,319
but

1069
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,680
after eliminating some vulnerabilities

1070
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,400
that were disclosed in the close hunting

1071
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,839

where bug bounty is available

1075
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,960
do they bring in bugs do or don't they

bring bugs

1077
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
how many do they bring

1078
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
and

1079
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,520
you may get new information for example

1080
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,960
you buy a new company

1081
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,760
and

1082
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,839
of course you have to analyze what kind

1083
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,480
of bugs it has in its infrastructure and

1084
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,839
you have to calculate

1085
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,000
what do we count

1086
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,319
take risk impact

1087
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,800
how much you can lose for that risk

1088
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,040
and try to

1089
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,680
find a

a week of bug counting hunting

1096
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,520
or a month of bug hunting

1097
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,200
so you can allocate a certain budget and

1098
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,720
give that money to the hacker who found

1099
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,800
most of the

1100
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
bugs or the best bugs

1101
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,359
and you will save the money

1102
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,760
if you believe that the stress test

1103
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,240
wouldn't work

1104
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,520
a week ago there was a similar

conference over the internet and the

1106
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,280
results were

1107
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,000
bad because

1108
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,599
two-thirds

1109
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,400
of the people already launched or

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,760
bug bounty six percent didn't

1112
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,960
believe in that idea as for

1113
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,240
evaluation of bugs

1114
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,160
they should be evaluated by the customer

or

1116
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,920
you can compare it to darknet but no one

1117
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,960
believes that bark bug bounty

1118
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,119
should be free

1119
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,480
that work should be paid for of course

the program which are socially important

1121
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,520
if they are free for the holder

1122
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,000
they are not free for the

1123
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,119
site

1124
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,920
because the backhunter gets

1125
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,839
points a reputation it's an internal

1126

um value and internal currency of the

have the higher is your reputation

whom

1185
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,560
we're talking about

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,839
independent reputation between the

each

1189
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,839
platform should be independent in this

way

1191
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,000
but not every platform manages to do

1192
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,240
that

1193
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,000
if we take

1194
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
a platform

1195
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,240
it's one thing the customer is quite

1196
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,079
another thing platform operators are

1197
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,800
also different

we have

so we can do it

1201
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,960
right from the very beginning

1202
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,000
by for example in britain in big

1203
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,400
organization they have a lot of legacy

1204
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,800
things they use printers in big banks

1205
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
metrics prints

1206
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,480
old epsons

1207
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,280
and they cannot

1208
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,800
scrap them because they spent a lot of

1209
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,000
money

1210
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,960
on them

1211
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,079
they went their evolutionary way there

1212
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,319
was no closed programs no other stories

1213
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,240
they reached evolutionary

1214
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,520
to

1215
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,520
their present conditions we can leapfrog

1216
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,200
and start without legacy

1217
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,760
we can do everything right from the very

1218
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,880
beginning i think the russian platform

1219
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,319
which one that's a question mark

1220
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,400
but it should be excellent from the

1221
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,839
beginning

1222
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,079
i can add that in the current realities

1223
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,680
import substitution doesn't work we just

1224
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,040
should have some platform of this kind

1225
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,920
regardless of what it means

1226
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,839
so it should exist and hackers should be

1227
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,400
there because the platform with big

1228
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,680
bounty without hackers doesn't work

1229
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,559
we need a lot of specialists looking for

1230
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,440
bugs

1231
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,960
we need openness transparency bugs

1232
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,920
should be disclosed if

1233
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,160
there are duplicate duplications you

1234
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,880
have to demonstrate duplications

1235
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,920
so we need more community managers

1236
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,079
rather than technicians to build the

1237
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,400
right platform of that kind in russia

1238
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,839
because

1239
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:42,839
we

1240
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,559
have little trust many people do not

1241
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,200
have trust in anything russian

1242
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,760
and they think that

1243
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,359
the russians will pay very little

1244
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:58,960
and

1245
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,559
also

1246
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,240
they will cheat

1247
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,590
because we the russians cheat each other

1248
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,719
[Music]

1249
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,280
we would like to

1250
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,599
brainwash somebody we want to

1251
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,559
cheat we want to

1252
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,000
launder some money so

1253
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,839
the main thing is to build good

1254
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,920
reputation to attract specialist hackers

1255
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,880
when they bring in bugs

1256
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,400
sooner or later they will be jailed

1257
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
they are afraid of that

1258
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,800
yes

1259
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,200
if you disclose a bug in the government

1260
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,200
agencies and publish it so uh

1261
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,119
there is a good chance of

1262
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,119
finding yourself in jail

1263
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,640
is there any future in russia with the

1264
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,559
russian platforms

1265
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,480
you were talking about import

1266
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
substitution but this is not the only

1267
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,520
reason so we rethought

1268
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,640
the

1269
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,960
idea of backbone bug bounty we don't

1270
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,040
want to pay for bugs

1271
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,280
we want to see

1272
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,920
the system that would show us that the

1273
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,839
bug is really critical

1274
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,760
we have to base

1275
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,720
our payment on impact but impact is not

1276
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,480
always obvious

1277
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,079
and the hacker

1278
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,359
sometimes can bring in much more damage

1279
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,079
that you can expect in our platform

1280
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,359
we want the hackers to find bugs to

1281
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,240
build the chains and show the maximum

1282
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,200
risk

1283
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,000
for the customer

1284
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,559
i would like to add that if

1285
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:49,440
the

1286
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,480
leading

1287
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
analytical agencies

1288
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,839
look at bug bounty market they say that

1289
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,520
they

1290
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,559
grow the market grows by 30 percent

1291
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,480
every year

1292
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,440
the bug bounty platform if it is good if

1293
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,000
it is convenient for the hacker if the

1294
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,760
hacker can sit at her down at home

1295
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,280
and

1296
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,760
earn good money

1297
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,559
and the earnings grow from year to year

1298
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,400
that is good

1299
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,160
for hacker for platform for business

1300
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,319
because more and more people

1301
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,119
are going to be involved the world is

1302
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,680
changing very fast

1303
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,880
three years ago nobody expected we're

1304
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,720
going to live in the world we're living

1305
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,079
in now

1306
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,280
and back bug hunting

1307
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,400
remote

1308
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,119
bug hunting

1309
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,319
could be acceptable for many people and

1310
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,359
the number of researchers and hunters is

1311
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,720
going to

1312
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,839
grow

1313
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,440
that's why

1314
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,880
the overall

1315
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,160
money

1316
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,520
flow

1317
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,800
in that kind of

1318
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,280
the market will also

1319
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,960
grow

1320
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,319
i like to what luca said once in pin

1321
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,160
tests you pay

1322
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,440
for the time

1323
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,079
as in the taxi in bug bounty you pay for

1324
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,640
the kilometers

1325
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,599
and the companies are ready to pay only

1326
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,119
for real bugs

1327
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,400
long term

1328
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,240
it's more convenient and more

1329
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,200
profitable and more beneficial it's a

1330
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,040
win-win situation to all the parties

1331
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,720
that's why it seems that

1332
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,079
everything will go on developing

1333
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,760
looks like that

1334
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,480
i agree with the colleagues but one

1335
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,240
there is one more driver

1336
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,598
it's mainstream

1337
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,440
with the

1338
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,520
young people

1339
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,760
we are all big children we like

1340
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,520
helicopters we like shooting

1341
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,359
cybersec needs new abbreviations every

1342
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,559
year

1343
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,440
now

1344
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,040
sdlc is in fashion then cm

1345
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,400
soc

1346
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,960
every year something new bug bounty in

1347
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,280
russia

1348
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,839
well is for the big companies

1349
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,200
but now

1350
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,160
the main stream

1351
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,839
is

1352
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,279
bug bounty in russia

1353
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,400
if we look we have three platforms which

1354
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,270
starts

1355
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,559
[Music]

1356
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,090
simultaneously cm

1357
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,599
[Music]

1358
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,640
before february 23

1359
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,960
because that was the requirement of the

1360
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,400
market

1361
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,680
and other platforms

1362
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,720
were born because customers came in and

1363
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,839
said we need that the market dictates

1364
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,078
that

1365
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,000
the market generates the drivers because

1366
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,040
they need something pin tests everything

1367
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,359
did it but but bounty

1368
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,520
this is something new

1369
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,280
a good driver

1370
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,480
i'm sorry

1371
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,240
maybe

1372
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,880
i'm wrong but

1373
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
we have already laundered the money in

1374
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,480
pintest we have to launder a couple of

1375
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,359
billion in buck bounty

1376
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,319
uh bison sold to kazakhstan a

1377
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,000
non-existent platform

1378
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,520
we are living in an

1379
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,319
inter in interesting times

1380
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,799
businesses business

1381
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,640
but well we have to pay attention and

1382
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,640
exert some efforts

1383
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,280
to do the job but the world has already

1384
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,599
invented everything we have to think

1385
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,760
whether we like it or not whether we

1386
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,880
accept it or not it it is good everyone

1387
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,040
accepts it everyone says it's a good

1388
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,079
story not only for not for everyone for

1389
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,839
some people but it's good that it's

1390
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,040
worth doing second it's not about import

1391
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,359
substitution russian companies cannot

1392
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,640
work in foreign platforms

1393
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,559
russian hackers cannot get paid from

1394
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,359
abroad and we have a good community of

1395
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,160
hunters hackers experts with good

1396
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,760
knowledge why not organize ourselves

1397
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,599
why not make it efficient

1398
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,839
it's an honest market

1399
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,040
competition that's what we need the

1400
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,559
government thinks uh well we need our

1401
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,559
own government-based

1402
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,319
closed system

1403
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,160
with government secrets

1404
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,960
yes uh

1405
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,839
but

1406
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,359
we cannot accept

1407
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:05,040
nationalization of the segment of the

1408
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,920
market bug bounty through this platform

1409
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,400
only no this is not the way

1410
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,720
we try to

1411
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,000
create the first trail-making

1412
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,559
steamer

1413
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,319
that other

1414
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,520
platforms may follow in honest

1415
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,960
competition

1416
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,400
which platform

1417
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,040
is better which is worse which is uh

1418
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,480
which attracts more hackers who

1419
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,319
pays better

1420
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,720
uh all the tools have already been

1421
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,960
invented long ago we have just to use

1422
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,839
them

1423
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,680
in the chat

1424
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,960
we actively discuss government-based

1425
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,440
bounty programs and there is one more

1426
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,960
question about

1427
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,720
government programs what is the

1428
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,480
difference between them

1429
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,640
and the commercial

1430
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,119
programs the first government

1431
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,160
based bug bounty can be opened this year

1432
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,319
is that right

1433
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,079
we're actively discussing it

1434
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,200
so please join me and answer the

1435
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,599
questions together with me

1436
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,920
right now as i said

1437
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,040
we are quite optimistic about uh bug

1438
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,400
bounty it's may it's spring

1439
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,559
everything is bringing

1440
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,960
coming back to life within this year

1441
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,319
before the end of the year we're sure to

1442
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:34,319
deploy bug bounty platform

1443
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,799
with a lot of operators

1444
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,760
uh closed platform but we're going to

1445
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,680
launch it

1446
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,200
so of course

1447
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,760
we want to protect the government-based

1448
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,720
system but that will be the an example

1449
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,720
for all the rest

1450
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,598
which way to go

1451
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,399
so that's it

1452
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,200
government bug bounty

1453
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,880
with entrance through gosu

1454
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,720
government services

1455
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,119
website

1456
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,559
so

1457
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,359
customers said authorization of pin

1458
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,000
testers through gosu

1459
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,720
they want that

1460
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,920
another question is about

1461
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,960
bounty

1462
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,040
bounty in russia is in the gray zone now

1463
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,480
can you

1464
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,119
change legislation

1465
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,599
yes i answered that question already

1466
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:32,720
just

1467
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,880
look through the

1468
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,319
list

1469
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,760
well as soon as

1470
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,720
well we found expertise and as soon as

1471
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,799
we realized that we need that system we

1472
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,400
heard several opinions expert opinions

1473
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,599
who said

1474
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:50,559
that

1475
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,440
bug bounty may be regarded as a gray

1476
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,040
zone

1477
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,599
it may

1478
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,200
ensue

1479
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,359
criminal

1480
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,720
causes

1481
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,160
article 282 283 we're waiting for the

1482
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,520
experts who did it before in commercial

1483
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,400
companies who launched bug bounty before

1484
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,960
with powerful lawyers who will come to

1485
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,480
us and say how the problem can be solved

1486
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,680
if we need uh i thought to change

1487
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,880
legislation or bug bounty should have

1488
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,280
universal agreements or something we

1489
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,359
have open doors we are waiting for the

1490
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,240
experts for lawyers who tell us

1491
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,799
what should be done to

1492
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,799
take back bounty out of the gray zone

1493
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,160
if none of my colleagues i want to add

panel discussion

1498
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,599
judging by the chat feeds and the voting

1499
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,359

myself i'd like to say that the interest

1501
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,319

its

1505
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,960
customers see it as a way

1506
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,160
to improve and step up information

1507
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,480
security for researchers

1508
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,720
