00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,920
hello everyone we are back

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,520
to the studio

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,960
and we are ready to start our broadcast

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,759
we are broadcasting live

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,920
from

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,480
page

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,039
phd

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,760
2022

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
and

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
the standoff standoff started two days

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,199
before phd and for the last two days our

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,400
attackers now defenders already um

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,960
working on and in our

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
states

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,800
and they have already achieved a lot and

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
i'm going to discuss what has already

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
happened with my friends i've got alexey

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,760
lobsin from you know stage hi alexey for

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
those of you who don't know in a stage

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
have been

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,120
with us for the last what two years

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
they've been our co-organizers for two

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
years now and also for two years you

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,120
have been participating in the stand-up

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
right yes

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,480
for two years now we've been the global

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
soc soc

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
we are observing everything that's

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,920
happening at the cyber polygon at the

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
cyber ground and we are reviewing the

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
reports of the blue and red teams and we

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
are going to interrogate you today

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
and i'll given off with my second guest

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
for those of you who

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
missed our talk with alex yesterday i'll

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,240
remind you that the while active

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,759
develops the

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
technically i.t component of our

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
standoff right

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
that's correct

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,720
so in the studio we have two people one

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,680
person

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,439
who created all of this and the second

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,400
person

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
who

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
had to

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
partially put it or had to

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
integrate into this infrastructure as a

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
serious soc are you happy with each

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
other's work

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
oh i can only speak for myself we have

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,200
been cooperating with this project for

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
many years and every year the project is

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,399
getting stronger we uh learn to

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
understand each other better and better

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
i need to interrupt you i'm sorry

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
terribly sorry because we are

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
broadcasting live news everything's for

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
real and just now just now in our state

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,959
at the railway station

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
there was an incident

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,079
an incident

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
yeah it's a basic scenario it's quite

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
basic

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,840
in the perimeter

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
it's a regular service that

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,879
controls ticket sales and it has a

68
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,160
simple vulnerability that enables you to

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,599
buy a ticket at no cost or other huge

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,840
discounts it's been happening several

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,160
times already in the last couple of days

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
well how many times

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
the ticket sales have already been

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,359
disrupted

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
it is the 14th time it is the 14th time

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
wonderful oh really

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,440
yeah hackers

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,319
are using this service uh it's it runs

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
open source there is a version you

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
google it and the fourth link

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
leads you to an exploit uh

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
and unable to become an admin for the

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
site yeah again we started this uh chain

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,360
yesterday it's like you are you're just

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,440
you have just provided the master class

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,519
on

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,879
hacking

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
and everyone who's seen us well i want

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
to try it myself and i'm sure that

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,159
everybody else would like to try it now

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,959
the more teams are out there trying to

92
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
abuse this business risk the fewest

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,400
scores they can get so today at this

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
point in the game it's not very

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,680
appealing really because i think a lot

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
the most you can get now is like a score

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
of 20.

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
it's best if you are now uh looking for

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
new risks and trying to execute new

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,439
risks at the end of two days all of the

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
offices all of the industries all of the

102
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,000
facilities all of the properties here

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,320
they have already been compromised the

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,478
attacker is already inside the

105
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
infrastructure somewhere on the user

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
side and somewhere even in the business

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
apps and only one step

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
separates them from

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,520
executing risks that would disrupt

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,320
the

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
various control and management systems

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
industrial

113
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
management systems when you created the

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,759
infrastructure what was your plan did

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
you think that the risks will be uh

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
implemented so fast and that the

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
attackers would be able to get inside so

118
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
fast

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
well we thought long about the format of

120
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
this conference we've got uh four days

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
right and uh

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
two days is the conference itself and we

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
want uh during those last few conference

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
days to achieve the maximum effect and

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
to get the highest involvement of

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
everyone so the first two days were a

127
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,440
warm-up and in the next two days we

128
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,680
expect major risks to come to life

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
so it's going according to the plan well

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
we are a news channel and we were

131
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,199
collecting news from yesterday we have a

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,160
quick report on what happened in the

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
last two days of the standoff so now

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
let's take a look at the screen and we

135
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,440
will be showing you our statistics

136
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,759
first thing i wanted to discuss

137
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,600
14.

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,960
unacceptable and admissible events were

139
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,520
executed in the last two days of cyber

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
training but overall we've got 100

141
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,160
potential incidents 14 out of 100 more

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
than uh 10 percent in two days is this a

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
good result do you think people need to

144
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,479
uh get better

145
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
okay let me

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
let me clarify something in the system

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,319
we have 100 unique risks

148
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,880
and our teams managed to find only three

149
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,199
unique risks and 14 unacceptable bands

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
that that means together i mean some

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
events were repeated

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
okay let's consider this to be a

153
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
preliminary training

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
our french colleagues

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
attackers

156
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
this team

157
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
sends their reports in english

158
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
why

159
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,199
why are you calling them a french team

160
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
if they are writing reports in english

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
well we suspect that these guys are from

162
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
france maybe because of their name but

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
get something and

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
our analysts are also show that they're

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,479
french maybe it's just a nickname that

166
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,160
they gave this team

167
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
okay guys if

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,120
you

169
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,639
uh

170
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,280
please write your next report in french

171
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
we will be very happy to get one report

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
in french

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,759
okay another thing um incident report

174
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,120
reports were submitted by the defenders

175
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
in two days right

176
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
probably didn't even see them

177
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,440
well um

178
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,800
yes actually

179
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
at the end of the game

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
day

181
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
we received several more instant reports

182
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
and currently the number is about 150.

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,720
and what about the industries

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
poor guys and heavy logistics that's the

185
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
logistics and transportation company

186
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,479
they

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
feel victims to most of the incidents

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,400
and

189
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
the risk of

190
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,759
changing the price of

191
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,240
tickets

192
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
that was another

193
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
major risk

194
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
i want to say thank you to defenders the

195
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
first risk

196
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
that was implemented now infrastructure

197
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,199
in a couple of minutes well two

198
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
they use the same vector but two teams

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
two teams uh uh

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,479
managed to uh to

201
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
exercise the same risk at the same time

202
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,800
so it was very difficult to separate the

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,440
two attacks and at the same time later

204
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,759
13 different teams managed to get this

205
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,640
risk out uh yes it happened at different

206
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,159
times but

207
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
we wanted to

208
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,640
again

209
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
say a huge thank you to our defenders

210
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,320
team who still prepare the reports

211
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
uh investigating all these

212
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
incidents

213
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,959
144 reports were received

214
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,680
in two days vulnerability reports

215
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,279
received during two days of cyber

216
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,000
exercise oh yes exactly that's the

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
correct number not all reports uh that

218
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
are submitted are

219
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
actually

220
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
they actually match our requirements but

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
you have requirements

222
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,680
yes we do we are asking people to give a

223
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
more detailed description of various

224
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
vulnerabilities that they abused but

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
yeah it's a good trend

226
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,600
and we hope that the next couple of days

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
we are going to see many more such

228
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
reports vulnerability reports

229
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
uh this year we have pretty realistic

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
industries we also have a financial

231
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
industry we've got a bank there we've

232
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
got inter-bank communication

233
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
and above everything else we also have

234
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,440
a

235
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
an exchange uh we've got companies that

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,680
are trading in the exchange which

237
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
companies are trading well is the

238
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,959
companies the six companies the six

239
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,240
segments

240
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,920
that uh are involved in the standoff

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
so all of these companies had my exactly

242
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
they are all traded companies they're

243
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
all listed and we are keeping track of

244
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,640
the current

245
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,640
capitalizations and

246
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
price per share

247
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
of these companies okay okay can we get

248
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,640
an exchange report then

249
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
the logistics company was hacked first

250
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
and the exchange responded to this we

251
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,540
also saw

252
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,760
[Music]

253
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
decline in

254
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
eps

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
of another company that was hacked so

256
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,839
every time a company or an industry is

257
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,640
hacked the

258
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
stock exchange response

259
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,959
reacts okay that's very very interesting

260
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,079
here at phd

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,120
well what we should be uh

262
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
monitoring

263
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
in order to understand which way the

264
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
stock exchange is going

265
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,279
well we have the service

266
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
available only

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,839
for the internal users maybe in the next

268
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
couple of days we'll be able to display

269
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
it for external users as well

270
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
somewhere here on the screen wow that's

271
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
wonderful wonderful good idea

272
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,519
in usoc

273
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
do you also take into account uh

274
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
the current uh stock exchange

275
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,160
uh ratings

276
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,839
i can't hear you julia okay i'll try to

277
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,079
shout okay moving on

278
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,440
well actually actually this year

279
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,320
in the last few days

280
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
twice as many vulnerable no no

281
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,680
vulnerability reports we we had twice as

282
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,040
many vulnerability uh reports this year

283
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
in the last few days than we received

284
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,760
during the november standoff over the

285
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
period of the whole four days is this

286
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,639
correct

287
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
well yeah it sounds right sounds right

288
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
but we have a different architecture

289
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
this time in november we had a big city

290
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
a big state but now we have a state and

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
different companies

292
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,680
different industries so last year there

293
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,000
was one entry point and now we have six

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,240
entry points it means more vulnerable

295
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
apps the infrastructure is uh

296
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
larger and probably it's

297
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,480
it's it's more exciting it's more

298
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,839
thought-provoking for the teams you see

299
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,560
what about

300
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
vulnerability reports

301
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
structure

302
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,600
uh more of which reports are you getting

303
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
now some daily blue switch reports

304
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
dominate well actually

305
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
we're getting all kinds of vulnerability

306
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
reports because different apps have

307
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
different vulnerabilities and most of

308
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,959
the attackers are following the

309
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,600
scenarios that we envisaged from the

310
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,639
very beginning so as soon as this

311
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,959
particular node is compromised means

312
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,680
that all other vectors that we uh

313
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
injected were compromised right

314
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,839
and sometimes i mean again we see

315
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,320
injections sometimes misconfigurations

316
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,040
something something else

317
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
it's going according to the plan well

318
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,920
it's very difficult to give the

319
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
statistics that you're asking for what

320
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
about defenders are defenders monitoring

321
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,320
all this

322
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
yeah yes uh well what could i add we see

323
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
that the people

324
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,120
are using all the latest vulnerabilities

325
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
very actively and they are also using

326
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,480
the serious amp symptom brisbaler

327
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,480
and

328
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
people are using it the people are

329
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,639
finding this vulnerability and they're

330
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,920
exploiting it successfully

331
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,199
well

332
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,480
you are

333
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
you are

334
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
a very special kind of guy yes i think

335
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,519
that you are giving people hints all the

336
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,639
time during this interview you

337
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,880
named all the vulnerabilities yesterday

338
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,880
you named the chains

339
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
you laid out for the teams well we are

340
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,800
helping

341
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,639
the red teams

342
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,680
and

343
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
at the same time we are surprised and we

344
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,240
are impressed by the level of their

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
training

346
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
we see which techniques the

347
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
people are using like dns tunneling for

348
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,240
instance i mean every time our analysts

349
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
see it they are very very happy it tells

350
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,040
you that people are serious about it

351
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
i mean

352
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
the defenders

353
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,480
they defenders are doing a sterling job

354
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,800
at the same time

355
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
to

356
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,079
i could criticize them

357
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,839
as well because

358
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,160
in some industries some of the rare

359
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,279
teams are

360
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
beginning to compete

361
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
when they answer this without

362
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
infrastructure they start to set up

363
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
other teams they start to

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
well but this is normal competition is

365
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,279
normal isn't it

366
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
before before this competition before

367
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,320
this tournament

368
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
we

369
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,079
agreed that we are not going to

370
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,519
uh

371
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
strive for a championship you see it's

372
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,959
not a championship

373
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,959
okay

374
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,199
on the defense side in the defenders

375
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,120
reports do you see the vulnerabilities

376
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,160
that

377
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
oleg mentioned do you see the tools

378
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,199
that all the techniques uh i mean

379
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,680
uh how how

380
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,959
amazing

381
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,479
the defenders reports are

382
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,680
well like i said

383
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,199
people

384
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
who are defending heavy logistics are

385
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,040
getting most of the battle

386
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
their reports

387
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
are quite complete

388
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,759
they are quite full

389
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
and like alex said we hope to see more

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,480
technical details it's something that

391
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
we are sometimes amazing in their

392
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
reports but again people are taking it

393
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
seriously and there are some

394
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
guys who have been at the standoff for

395
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
many years it's not their first time and

396
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,320
you can sell just by looking at the

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
response time at the quality of the

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,639
report you can sell it

399
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,120
by the quality of their preparation to

400
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,880
tv and they know what you expect and

401
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,399
what you look they know their

402
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,000
infrastructure very well and their

403
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
reports are submitted on time

404
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,160
