1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,400
and secret service agents are those who

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,880
are with us in the modern world they're

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
not just cyber security agents

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
cyber agents who are those cyber agents

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,279
we're going to speak about denis

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,119
kushinov is with us at the

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,640
research of threats of informational

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
security department

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
in the security center of positive hello

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
denise and alex coolin the head of

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,719
digital criminalistics and forensics

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,640
and ib group

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,000
from the ib group okay guys let's begin

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
of what is a cyber

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,280
it sounds interesting what is the main

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
part of it

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
cyber intelligence

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
it's data

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,039
this is data

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,000
which has to answer the question to who

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
attacks

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
when attacks when he can attack

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,199
and

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
what he uses for attacking his

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,960
motivation why is he doing the attack

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,159
attacks what attacks any organization

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,400
does some uh criminal campaign for

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,479
example his the group

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
motivate

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,920
to steal money

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
they can be involved in this espionage

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,159
and cyber intelligence in a simple way

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,000
should answer those questions these

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
simple questions

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
so

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,479
much time intelligence manager works

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,000
with a lot of data

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
he collects a lot of data collects data

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
about tactics of different groups

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
indicators of compromising

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
so this data volume can be applied to

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
discover attacks

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,560
to speak about who attacks you

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,850
uh

45
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,880
[Music]

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
and when we collect this data

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
one cannot say when this data will be

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
useful we can collect this data right

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,040
now but they will become useful in one

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,119
month from now some people are preparing

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,479
the attack right now and we're saying

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
that we have the data something that

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
wind form of those data but this data

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,319
will be relevant only one month from now

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,319
when the attack will happen

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,800
so as a fact we try to prevent certain

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,239
attack we work preventively

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
but there are cases when the attack

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
happened

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
and the client says we're being attacked

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
and we have data

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
from a certain company

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
research we know the taxes of when we

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,160
say that in your system you can search

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
for these indicators

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,518
and this hacker a group

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,519
penetrate through the external perimeter

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
they go there they use this exploit some

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
wpo

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
and by this you can speed up the

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
reaction

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
and mitigate all the consequences which

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
might happen data destruction theft of

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
money or data

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
so cyber intelligence

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
they do that well ib group is known for

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,519
their cyber intelligence

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
this is not just simply data of course

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
the data are at the core installed by

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,319
this data should be in the context the

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,840
cyber intelligence what is the

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
motorsport i think is the

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
we have a lot of different uh software

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
we have a lot of tactics and techniques

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
and procedures

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,640
more than 400 but the most important

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
thing is that cyber intelligence allows

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
us to collect data about specific groups

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,400
and most importantly understand which

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,680
organizations are being attacked by

91
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
these groups

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
so cyber intelligence allows you not

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
only for technical specialists to get

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
important information but also to the

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
top managers of those organizations

96
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,519
and they can make priorities for the

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,280
budgets they can understand who's going

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
to attack them they will understand how

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,599
they will be attacked and what are the

100
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,200
goals of those criminals if they will

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
enter this corporate network

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
so it's not right to think that cyber

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
intelligence is a supply of the

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,519
indicators of compromisation

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,079
some people do that they just download

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
into cm a lot of ip addresses and

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,279
whatever well this is also a tactical

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,320
level

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,080
it does exist but there's also a

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
strategic and operational one in cyber

111
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
intelligence uses tactics techniques and

112
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,600
procedures to properly detect them and

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
on a strategic level also understand

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
threats and prioritize

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
them

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
how can we understand

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
how cyber intelligence manager should

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
understand well the hacker

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
thinks about some actions he did not do

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
these actions how can you understand

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
what he wants to do

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
well everything depends

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
from potential goal

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
and it's not like that for example

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
there's a lot of different groups

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
some groups

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
are motivated financially some groups

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,880
are representing interests of certain

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
states and

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
same intelligence because we can say

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,479
that it can be a counter uh cyber

132
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,000
intelligence it will speak about threat

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,199
intelligence

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
so the there's a lot of groups like that

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,120
and in principle cyber intelligence

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
people they know what they're interested

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,919
in on the basis of this information we

138
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,120
can understand if the group a

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
e enters network b

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
what this group will do in this network

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
because

142
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,680
we know about their reputation yes

143
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
okay let's speak about who are those

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
attackers and what do they attack

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
how do you see it especially in recent

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
days did we see any changes in the

147
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,080
trends or the intensity of attacks

148
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,039
you see

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
in recent days

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
especially due to political events the

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,680
trends have changed

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
there is a lot of attacks targeting

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
risk

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,440
reputation risks destruction of data in

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
recent days we see that we see mass

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
leakages of information

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
breaks are happening

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,639
we see through the news through the

159
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,039
tweets and many people have heard about

160
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,280
this anonymous group which acts in

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,800
political goals they are targeting

162
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
uh breaking into russian communists and

163
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
if we compare the year 2021 they we see

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,199
one more attacks like that ddos

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,510
breaking

166
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,360
[Music]

167
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,039
how much more

168
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
single percentages or dozens

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
significantly not dozens but

170
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
significantly more

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
if hackers can find a small crack in

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,800
perimeter they will get through it is

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,599
and i can say this is a days of big bend

174
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
tests and many companies who never faced

175
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
it they are facing right now frequent

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
incidents

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,039
but we still have

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,680
opt groups the trend is still kept it's

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
growing but not in amount like this

180
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
explosive growth

181
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
of such attacks

182
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,759
out of tactics i can say that new

183
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,240
tactics are available and right now

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
there is a supply chain trend it's

185
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
called supply chain through the open

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
source because

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,319
it's not a really nice one can you

188
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,840
disclose this supply chain to the open

189
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,919
source it may not sound well supply

190
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,680
chain to the open source it's attached

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,720
to the delivery chains through

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
some products uh which are in open

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
source okay can you give us an example

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
for example well let's speak about a

195
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,120
banking company

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,680
well solar makes yeah solar mix yeah

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,919
it's a story it's an old story i would

198
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,199
like to speak about something new for

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,720
example

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,960
there is a repository for developers of

201
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
javascript npm and

202
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
with political

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
statements they've been downloading data

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
political banners and people have been

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
installing it they've seen those banners

206
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
clients have seen those banners and

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,199
nobody stops them from this and this is

208
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,280
available they can download malicious

209
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
code in it and when many companies

210
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
download these updates to themselves

211
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
they receive a backdoor to the update

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
they download uh default uh backdoor and

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,240
open source is uh

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
we've been considering we still consider

215
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
that this is outside of politics and all

216
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
of this but still

217
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
people are behaving like that this is

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
not really nice unfortunately

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,839
unfortunately but it is happening

220
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,519
it was happening

221
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,760
and it continues to happen

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,519
i believe that this trend will come to

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
nothing but the supply chain if

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,760
yesterday vladimir and igor zelevsky

225
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
were telling us about

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
asian pt groups they've been attacking

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
to the black net it's an interesting

228
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
supply chain that those who didn't watch

229
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
this report please look at it supply

230
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
chain is uh moving up phishing stays

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
there it's still available

232
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
and this is interesting to the open

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
source supply chain

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
well uh there is a statement

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,519
as if in every company in every business

236
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,200
they do have some internal group hiker

237
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,920
group insiders to your point of view is

238
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,920
it a truthful statement or not really

239
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
i think this is more related to state

240
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
organizations and organizations which

241
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,480
are posing interest to foreign

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
intelligence i might agree with this if

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,839
we speak globally about

244
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
mostly no then yes but usually business

245
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,959
has another problem

246
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,839
because even right now it's not

247
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
well protected so criminals if they have

248
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,480
a desire it's not difficult for them to

249
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
enter any network and it's not necessary

250
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,080
to use any complicated techniques like a

251
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
supply chain attacks same phishing

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,640
same publicly accessible application

253
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
remote access services

254
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,800
they are very easy come easily

255
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
compromised and attackers

256
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
are using

257
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
like it was working 15 years ago it

258
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
still continues to work

259
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
talking about the threat landscape in

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
russia

261
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
it's very actively developing in the

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,399
course of last month

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,360
and we do see that activities have been

264
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
activated if previously they've been

265
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,920
doing nothing which activists activities

266
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
okay

267
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
anonymous

268
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,160
like anonymous and all other people

269
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,959
who are trying to support or to

270
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,320
give response to some political

271
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
phenomena of the current world

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
and not just doing ddos attacks but also

273
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
attacks

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
against different organizations well

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
according to your opinion

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
goals for these hack groups today

277
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,839
are more

278
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,440
provocative like anonymous that

279
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
something happens and anonymous takes

280
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
responsibility or

281
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
they are aimed against making

282
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
significant damage to companies

283
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
i think this is a temporary story plus

284
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
many groups can use it as some

285
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
smoke wall because we do

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
see that they have activated traditional

287
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
financially motivated cyber criminals

288
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,839
because first of all

289
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,160
russia right now for many countries

290
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,320
became absolute legitimate

291
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
for a hacking country and interesting

292
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,000
and financially motivated

293
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
and financially motivated hackers are

294
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
interested in this while everybody is

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
looking at anonymous today perfectly

296
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
breaking networks and

297
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
they get

298
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,680
ransom

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
if we're speaking about the ransomware

300
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
we fix

301
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
that are four

302
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,399
times more of them than last year big

303
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
number if previously we've seen those

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
attacks in the west and mostly these

305
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
were russian-speaking groups even

306
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,160
russian-speaking groups they are

307
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
attacking

308
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,560
russia

309
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
and they have big interest

310
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,279
uh in big companies

311
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
which previously

312
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
they have not been attacking and right

313
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
now everything has changed

314
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
what is their main target actually

315
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,959
speaking

316
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
if you look at different hacks like

317
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
anonymous

318
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
they are not

319
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
blackmailing

320
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,720
they don't require ransom but they have

321
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
reputational and physical damage

322
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
they destroy data

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
and if they steal data they publish them

324
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
without any warning

325
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
so basically

326
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
this is a cyber war stage

327
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,040
with maximal damage against the enemy

328
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,480
let's speak about attribution

329
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
what is it

330
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
and is it possible in the course of

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
cyber intelligence to understand

332
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,800
yes of course it's possible to

333
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,120
understand okay in the beginning what is

334
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,560
it let's

335
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
open the term attribution of healthcare

336
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
attack attribution as we've told you

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
well uh there's a big number of criminal

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
and sponsored groups

339
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,440
well attribution of attack to a certain

340
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
group

341
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,519
but we did not disclose the term

342
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
this is when we determine who stands

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
behind this attack

344
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
so which hacker group stands behind it

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,040
because groups can use unique malicious

346
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
code unique tactics techniques and

347
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,359
procedures but sometimes

348
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
especially if we speak about cyber

349
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
criminals and not cyber war or sponsored

350
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
by the state groups

351
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,399
speak let's speak about ransomware uh

352
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
companies well in recent years it became

353
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
very complicated because it's all based

354
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
on partnership programs same people are

355
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
jumping through different partnership

356
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,480
programs they use same tools the same

357
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,880
malicious software plus they use

358
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
services from other attackers

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,959
which are tuning servers which

360
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,320
uh rent out uh malicious software and

361
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
right now very often it's mixed up

362
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,560
before the attacker have encoded uh

363
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,639
with some unique ransomware it's very

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,279
hard to say who stands be behind these

365
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,959
ransom attack speaking about the

366
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,040
sponsored groups sponsored by the state

367
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,959
it's much simpler with that but it's not

368
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,480
always happens like that and we see

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
examples when one group breaks

370
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
infrastructure of another group and uses

371
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
the malicious software of another group

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,040
uh posing as some american group

373
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,279
and american group shows itself as a

374
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
iranian group and there could be certain

375
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,760
complications in the

376
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,839
attribution but it depends on how much

377
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
data is available for this type of

378
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
intelligence if this data is sufficient

379
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
then it's easy to attribute this attack

380
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,639
if you don't have sufficient data then

381
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,720
unfortunately it might be very difficult

382
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,639
or impossible

383
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
yeah you can always say but you should

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
make mistake

385
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
and you should not make a zoo of many

386
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
groups because right now from year to

387
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
year we see more and more publications

388
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,959
of reports about different groups and

389
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,880
every researcher wants to bring

390
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
something new

391
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,199
so we can say well i found a new group

392
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,000
this is a new group but at the same time

393
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,959
as it was properly said uh from ib group

394
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
there are tools which are shared between

395
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,079
groups either person just comes from one

396
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,120
group to another group or

397
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
just buys from one developer and it

398
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
happens that when we attribute by code

399
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
then we have not really nice situations

400
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
and we say that well this is another

401
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,680
group but it's not always like that

402
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
maybe this is one group and we can speak

403
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
about it

404
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,880
and many researchers they have a lot of

405
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,040
reports they are not always able to

406
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,399
speak about it and they say well this is

407
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,480
a new group

408
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,360
because

409
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
bank database is not available we don't

410
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,519
have agreement between vendors how to

411
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
properly name those groups every vendor

412
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,759
has his own system of naming apt-1

413
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,800
somebody calls as ta 428

414
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
somebody calls it just like

415
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,160
uh from the mentally spread table

416
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,519
somebody

417
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,440
invents some entities and they use them

418
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
as names so you open the group card

419
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,880
and you see 15 names of these groups and

420
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,040
say well i will invent another one and

421
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
it happens that

422
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
it's like a snowball

423
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,000
grows very fast

424
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
in case if the self attribution is

425
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,759
possible in case if it's understandable

426
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,839
what kind of a hacker group it is what

427
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,680
happens next of course you have this

428
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,320
data uh on the side of the cyber

429
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
intelligence person

430
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
officer okay we see data what kind of a

431
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,320
hacker group is involved and then we are

432
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
during the incident we're sitting there

433
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,440
we'll research the incident and say that

434
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
this particular group has certain tool

435
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,599
it does this and these techniques

436
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,240
it moves all over the network it's

437
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
financially motivated

438
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
it steals money

439
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,599
it encodes computers and sells money so

440
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,919
we can assume but other steps will be

441
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,079
available but if for example the final

442
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,599
point of incident

443
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,079
when everything is encoded for example

444
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,240
something was stolen we say where did

445
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
they come from and we are saying with

446
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,799
which techniques they went into the

447
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,120
network and were saying which wpo has

448
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
been used how they use network

449
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
infrastructure uh which certificates do

450
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
they use how do they transfer data et

451
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
cetera so on the basis of all this data

452
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
you can quickly investigate incidents

453
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,000
and you can say who's standing behind it

454
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,080
basically we can have small

455
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,039
data

456
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,480
when we react to incident there's a

457
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
certain host that will was compromised

458
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
because my system administrator have

459
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
seen some potentially malicious activity

460
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
i don't know maybe relation with some

461
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,799
well-known command and controls

462
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
and if we have cyber intelligence data

463
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,840
which

464
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,679
we can attribute it to

465
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
we also

466
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,080
the group

467
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,320
and understand what was uh taken by this

468
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
group and it speeds up our reaction to

469
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
the incident and we can prevent

470
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,880
appearance of these negative events

471
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
not the finals of the

472
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,120
attack will this data be transferred to

473
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
police for the investigation do you have

474
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
these practices of course

475
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,640
but if it's a foreign attack

476
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,960
and this is uh not uh somebody from

477
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
outside from the charity of russian

478
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,799
federation when you figure this out

479
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,200
well it happens differently but the

480
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
organizations which are involved

481
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,679
speaking about cyber criminality

482
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,559
not about state sponsored groups

483
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,080
because it's much more complicated but

484
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
speaking about

485
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
traditional cyber criminality possibly

486
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
anybody many of you heard that during

487
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
last year there were a lot of arrests

488
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
related with ransomware

489
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,919
and people who somehow are related with

490
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,559
this principle just yesterday

491
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,840
there was a publication that

492
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
behind us the person who've been

493
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
developing and developing it's a citizen

494
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,919
of venezuela he was discovered and he

495
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,840
was uh

496
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
law enforcement agencies are exchanging

497
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,840
data on the international level there's

498
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
interpol europe all and this is all

499
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,360
realistic and it works honestly it works

500
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
and you know these recent cases they do

501
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
confirm it okay thank you very much guys

502
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,320
cyber

503
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,000
criminality it's the same criminality

504
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,799
but in a digital space

505
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
but there is no difference where the

506
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,960
crime was committed in digital space or

507
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,400
in real world just for the simple reason

508
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
that virtual and real worlds are

509
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,520
inseparable right now the role of cyber

510
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
intelligence is to

511
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,559
investigate and prevent cyber crimes and

512
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,919
right now we've been speaking with two

513
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,360
cyber uh investigators alex corkov from

514
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
