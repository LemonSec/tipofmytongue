1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,279
let's continue talking about interesting

2
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,119
and unusual topics

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,000
and from space ships flying in outer

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,279
space

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,320
we're flying to the

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,359
theater we're going to speak about how

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
complicated technical not interesting

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,239
topics

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
can be presented to people in such a way

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,920
so that they can be

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
astonished

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
they would become happy

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
and start acting so we will speak

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,480
how technical topics can be

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,199
brought to ted speech and i have two

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,480
guests here

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,120
i'm really happy

18
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,359
in order for you to understand who

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
you're speaking to oxana

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
is ted ex

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,439
street

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,759
yes i remember

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320
was able to

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
promote his topic very complicated topic

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,799
to this ted speech

26
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
twice

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
yeah twice he was able to do it twice

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
and it's not the limit

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,920
so i wanted to discuss this with you

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
this situation

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,240
i hope you're going to tell us do we

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,119
need topics like that and do people

33
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,159
expect news from the world of cyber

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,399
business and cyber technologies yes of

35
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
course organizers wait for something

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
like that and if you will look at

37
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,799
organizer as the architect of the event

38
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,479
and taking consideration the fact that

39
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
this event should uh contain information

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
about all the spheres so technologies

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
are something new constantly developing

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,598
has a quotation or a quota for this

43
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,840
technical presentation

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
but organizers usually go to people that

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
everybody hear about of course i would

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,319
like to call

47
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,040
edward snowden if i would have a choice

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
or maybe who else is very popular david

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
young evgeny

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
those that everybody know

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
everybody heard ivan such golf until

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,200
recently

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
but everybody else

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
they speak about themselves

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
they speaking themselves to their own

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,239
brand

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
and then they come to tedx or maybe they

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
have to write to the organizers and of

59
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,879
course we want to know people want to

60
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,440
know because this is where the future is

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
they'll probably understand you

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
that these topics they have to be

63
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,599
carried by well-known people or maybe

64
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,720
people

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,239
who are well-known and who are super

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
professionals in their topic they can

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
also speak at the tedx and be

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
interesting speakers there and become

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
interesting for the organizers but for

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
the organizers it's not always

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
understandable to all the technologies

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
but these topics have to be presented

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
but another topic is

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
how many of those ideas inside of the

75
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,799
cyber security topic or technologies and

76
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
everything else

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
i think that we can dig very deep

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
because we've been speaking about

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
robots will they enslave us or not if

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,959
it's not going to be punished and then

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
we've been speaking about

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
the data that should be treated properly

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
everybody speaks about it

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
the one who wants to speak he needs to

85
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
search for a new aspect of the same

86
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
topic

87
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
can you tell us how you've been looking

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
for the new aspect

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
when you've been getting ready for the

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,080
tedx

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
he participated in the tedx two times

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
and you had topics about what

93
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,799
it was long time ago it was something

94
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,040
very popular

95
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,959
it was about personal confidentiality

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,478
and how can you treat

97
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,519
your own pictures

98
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,240
where you can lose your personal

99
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,720
confidentiality and how can this be

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,680
negative to us which threats we can see

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
the first presentation was an overview

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
presentation and then i tried to say

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
that

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
cyber security is very important and we

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,720
can't even imagine which consequences

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,680
they cyber security from cameras from

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
your phones from computers from the

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
internet devices

109
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
it can lead us to

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,600
very real negative consequences in the

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
physical world when people have been

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
losing their apartments

113
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
they were not able to enter their smart

114
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
houses because they were tuned

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
improperly

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
what do you think is that that and it's

117
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
a task it's a task for you

118
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
your favorite combination of words uh

119
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
from your work life

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
computer incidents okay something else

121
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360
in this accommodation there are two

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,440
words i begin one uh begins with t

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
another with h

124
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,560
threat hunting so the task

125
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,199
oksan is with us and we are the

126
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,280
examination team

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,639
you have a task

128
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
you should invent how you're going to

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
tell us about threat hunting in such a

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
way so that it would become

131
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,199
interesting that would be exhilarated

132
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
and we would think that this topic is

133
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
worthy of ted speech

134
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
threat hunting

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,919
it's very difficult for roxanna she

136
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
doesn't know what it is

137
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,800
well i know these two words

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
informational security this is a

139
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
separate area of activities very

140
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
important activity because the most

141
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
important activity in threat hunting

142
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,120
is to make hypothesis

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
for specific infrastructure specific

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
companies for

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
maybe industry

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
information

147
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
in the area of informational security to

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,199
make hypothesis and these hypotheses

149
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,919
usually related to the question of

150
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,240
discovery of

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,639
fraudsters inside of the infrastructure

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
and then you start to check these

153
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,919
hypotheses and you have to try

154
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
retrospectively

155
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,639
look at

156
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,800
whether there was a penetration of a

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
criminal in the infrastructure if it was

158
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,000
or was not is it a truthful hypothesis

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
maybe it has to be specified or improved

160
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
and thanks to these

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
you should find in infrastructure those

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
hackers that you were not able to

163
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
discover previously and when this

164
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
hypothesis works once through its

165
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
attacks

166
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
then the process is built in such a way

167
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
so that these hypotheses should work

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
continuously and ideally it should

169
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
become a new detector new knowledge of

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,479
informational security products

171
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,360
and it would search for hackers without

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
humans

173
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
okay can you repackage this term can you

174
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,199
tell us story about it

175
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
we can give him 15 seconds to think

176
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,599
about it well first of all you can use

177
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,120
some metaphorical statement a bright

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
example

179
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,919
for

180
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
dummies

181
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,840
which idea comes to your mind well it's

182
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,759
not the most important thing about this

183
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,520
explanation of something it's a good

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,479
thing

185
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,479
in simple words what complicated things

186
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
but what is also important is to show

187
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,319
the usefulness for the one who is

188
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,240
listening well the usefulness for the

189
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,800
one who is listening

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
let's flip this story to another side

191
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
because honestly speaking at the given

192
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,319
moment of time the informational

193
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,039
security market has a big

194
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
thirst for

195
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
qualified employees

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
and others for those people who are

197
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
burning for their work and they love to

198
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
work and many people when you speak

199
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
about computer science computer security

200
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
information security and when you speak

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
about this technology many people think

202
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
that this is boring not interesting

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
mathematics physics

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,159
some complicated technical skills but

205
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,679
honestly speaking it's not like that

206
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,240
honestly speaking it involves colossal

207
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,958
field or creativity and threat hunting

208
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,719
is one of those elements

209
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,680
related with creativity so speaking in

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,959
analogies

211
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
make a hypothesis

212
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,880
that i want to fly from one mountain to

213
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
another mountain which wings i need for

214
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
that

215
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
for the first time you can select

216
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
unsuccessful form of the wings and you

217
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,880
die but

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,959
usually you try try try trying to

219
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,040
discover something new which is gonna

220
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
become useful become important and this

221
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
is a colossal element of creativity it's

222
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,440
a very important charge for your brain

223
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
and

224
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
even people who can find parallels

225
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,120
between different spheres of life

226
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
they can because what about digital

227
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
technologies well digital technologies

228
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
is the mirror of our real life that's

229
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
what digital technology is and honestly

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,760
speaking we have to transfer

231
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,519
those things

232
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,600
in which we have skills in our daily

233
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
life into the digital life same for the

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
threat hunting we need to discover uh

235
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
threats

236
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
for example when somebody approaches us

237
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
in the street can i look at your wallet

238
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
how much money do you have in your

239
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,880
wallet well how much money

240
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
can you give me your phone number to

241
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
make a call well that's another one

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
and everybody understands it everybody

243
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,560
makes an assessment uh

244
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
but in some cases you can give a mobile

245
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
phone to a person maybe really something

246
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
bad happen with the person and this

247
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,760
person needs to make a call

248
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,839
so we do know how to make assessments

249
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
and during the evolution we know how to

250
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
make assessments is it true or not

251
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
should but when in the messenger

252
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
somebody writes you can you give me your

253
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
phone number of your email address

254
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,800
please follow the link give the password

255
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
and login doesn't include those factors

256
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
so how can we transfer these factors

257
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
from real world into digital world and

258
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
how by using these factors we can

259
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
discover criminals well the flight of

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,160
the bumblebee the flight of the

261
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,519
creativity

262
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
interesting topic

263
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
in your conversation alexis

264
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
i've heard five different directions

265
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
which can be divided into five different

266
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,279
speeches

267
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
the most beautiful things already have

268
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
been verbalized you should have one idea

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
and one topic and some specific steps

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
which users should make here and now

271
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
because they are not going to remember

272
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
two ideas three ideas

273
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
but it's an interesting topic especially

274
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,519
if you have invented well

275
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,279
informational security

276
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,360
well it is so interesting because it

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
might involve this this and that

278
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,839
we have a lot of fun

279
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,440
here can you tell me please is it

280
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
difficult

281
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,640
because when you evaluate who's going to

282
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
be included into the program which

283
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,279
criteria do you use

284
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
for the future speakers should there be

285
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,519
known people or the topic should be

286
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,560
interesting

287
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
well well people it's if there's a topic

288
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,519
you know nothing about it to the

289
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
authority you will definitely be able to

290
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,399
convey this message to everybody else

291
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,079
but usually i have three criterias first

292
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,839
the availability of the idea because

293
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,320
even if it's a cool well-known speaker

294
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,880
but he has no idea that he wants to

295
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,920
share with other people

296
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
then we don't have this presentation but

297
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,079
what is idea can you give me an example

298
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,000
of an idea well i do have the ideas

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
while sitting here

300
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
idea which can be packaged into a

301
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,880
twitter statement which is a short but

302
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
not basic for example if you take a

303
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
speech of one of my favorite and one of

304
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
the well-known ted speeches

305
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
ken robinson about the school his idea

306
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
that the modern school kills creativity

307
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
and we have to change it very good idea

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
but then through stories through

309
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,160
personal examples he tells us it in such

310
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,839
a way so that we look at his

311
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,600
presentations and we cry and we say that

312
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
yes the school has to be changed and i

313
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
will start today with my kids i will

314
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
treat them differently i'll follow their

315
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
individuality

316
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,399
so it should

317
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,200
lead to a certain action not necessarily

318
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,160
but at least

319
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
it should be verbalized if you can

320
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
verbalize something it means that you

321
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
have understood it and remember the

322
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,519
second thing it's the expert expertness

323
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,600
it's not necessarily that this person

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
should be a mega superstar like elon

325
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
musk yes of course it would be wonderful

326
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,040
but it's not necessary and it's

327
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,639
sufficient if you work in a sphere

328
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
which is connected with your idea and if

329
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,079
alexi for example is going to write to

330
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,480
the organizers of anybody and he said i

331
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
will speak about the flight

332
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,240
to the mars what the mass has to do with

333
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
it are you flying to the mars are you

334
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,639
researching the topic of the mosque

335
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,160
well the previous speaker was from mars

336
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
so the expertness should be related to

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
the topic this could be a number of

338
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,959
publications this could be some

339
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
i don't know patents

340
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
which you have had in your sphere maybe

341
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,440
inventions you've had in it and the

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
earlier person starts working his brand

343
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,000
the better it is for other people in

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,839
other spheres and number

345
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,440
three some presentation skills at least

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
basically it's not a commercial

347
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
conference

348
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
so we want to keep a balance between

349
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
efforts that you spend for preparing the

350
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,519
speaker

351
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
and the result

352
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,920
is it difficult to prepare a speaker

353
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,279
yes and no

354
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,120
if the speaker wants to get ready

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
nothing difficult in there but if he

356
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,720
doesn't want he will never come to you

357
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,120
there are complicated stories when we

358
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
have very strong public relations

359
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
manager and he says well we're going to

360
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
prepare with somebody else good person

361
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,959
good topic uh but not something is not

362
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
working so if the person has no desire

363
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,880
to invest into the training nothing's

364
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
going to work

365
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,600
do you agree yes i do yes i agree

366
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
well the question you ask the answer you

367
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
get

368
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,440
it is

369
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,760
difficult to stop

370
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,839
speaking technological language and try

371
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
to explain in simple words

372
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
in understandable words in analogies

373
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
especially to those people who

374
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
understand nothing in computer security

375
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
and things that you do or why it might

376
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,199
be important to them

377
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
so a selection of these words proper uh

378
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
metaphorical comparisons this is the

379
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,279
most complicated part

380
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,639
when i was thinking

381
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,800
that we have to talk

382
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
to each other i've googled

383
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,079
what presentations we might have

384
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,680
especially those related with cyber

385
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,800
security on ted and i've discovered

386
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,519
three big areas one of them is

387
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
confidentiality and personal data the

388
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,519
second area everything which is related

389
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,680
with our favorite gadgets

390
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
all this stuff and direction number

391
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
three about

392
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,440
how cool are those hackers okay so both

393
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
of you tell me please what do you think

394
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,710
why these three topics

395
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,440
[Music]

396
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,959
resolution

397
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,639
well speaking about the end users they

398
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,720
ask themselves a question why am i

399
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,519
listening this

400
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
because maybe

401
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
something complicated

402
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,839
and it's very difficult to build

403
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,320
connection with the end user and maybe a

404
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
state commercial secret nobody has

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,600
prohibited in any country technologies

406
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
are developing very fast they're

407
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
entering the area of strategic interests

408
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
of those countries where they are

409
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,440
invented so there should be a proper

410
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
balance between all those things

411
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
not don't you think that people don't

412
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
know anything

413
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,680
and that you have to tell and speak

414
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
about new stories

415
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,759
maybe i need to explain

416
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
but there's a interesting for a person

417
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
what he understands and something that

418
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
is closer to him

419
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,720
so if you will speak about some

420
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
peculiarities

421
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,839
of highly loaded systems discovering on

422
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,079
the flight something something something

423
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,959
some samsung even you not you'll be

424
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,120
interested in such a speech so if you

425
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,680
build connection between usefulness then

426
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
of course

427
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
it's going to be interesting

428
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,759
but these are topics which are on the

429
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,520
surface

430
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,880
that's why

431
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
when the

432
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,039
cream was removed from the surface there

433
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,480
will be people

434
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,039
desiring going deeper into these topics

435
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,679
and tell us something new something more

436
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,760
accessible something more difficult in a

437
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
more accessible language well a

438
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,599
philosophical question to both of you

439
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,119
let's try to philosophize why

440
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,720
why you do what you do do you do ted and

441
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,440
why

442
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
she doesn't why do you participate in

443
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
this death who's going to be the first

444
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
one

445
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,760
i'm going to be the first one

446
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,679
well ted

447
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
yes

448
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,320
i'm really confident that events like

449
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
these terrorists

450
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
are changing our society around

451
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
they make people better they help people

452
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
to get expressed

453
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,400
for ideas to be expressed

454
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,520
that well it was so important for me i

455
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,799
wrote a book

456
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
it helped me to express myself it helped

457
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
me to receive certain support

458
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,520
so it's

459
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,039
it's a human growth

460
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,679
yeah somehow it is and it's always nice

461
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
to be in the company of same thinkers

462
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,360
good and cool people so it's community

463
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
that you build around yourself it's

464
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
always wonderful

465
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
at the same time

466
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,919
no

467
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,320
looking at what i do in my work

468
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,480
i separate it as a hobby

469
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,120
when you say why do you do that you

470
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,799
create a community of people who are

471
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,280
interested in working with each other

472
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,440
so we in security we work like you

473
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
in syria

474
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
we find interesting people

475
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
who are interested in talking to each

476
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,240
other it's an interesting concept it

477
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
really has touched me and i will think

478
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
about it for quite a while

479
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,400
why

480
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
did you apply those efforts to speak

481
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,240
there

482
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,799
well it's a new experience tedx getting

483
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,880
out of the comfort zone

484
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
and second of all cyber security it's

485
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,160
kind of a box in itself but we are all

486
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
boiling in this box together with each

487
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
other we're communicating the bird

488
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,880
language and we're not leaving this box

489
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,160
but there's a good analogy

490
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,840
with the rules of the road

491
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
because as soon as cars started

492
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
appearing here

493
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,120
we have evolved

494
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
and the person has learned a lot of

495
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,960
words this is zebra this is the light

496
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
street light

497
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,240
digital technology is penetrated into

498
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
our lives so much that when a person

499
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,480
receives smartphone in his hands he

500
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
should have a dual factor authorization

501
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,960
etc etc and if we being in this box

502
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,559
we're not going to tell the rest of the

503
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,400
world about it the world is not going to

504
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
change but if the world is not going to

505
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,600
change

506
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
these bad hackers

507
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,240
will become more and more successful

508
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,039
in making their cyber

509
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,400
crimes and it's going to be much more

510
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
difficult for us to win them and make

511
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,360
this world more secure

512
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,280
so the laziness moves the progress

513
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,039
to work less

514
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,919
