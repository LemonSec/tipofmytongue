5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,639

my god what do you mean oh my god was it

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,600
difficult was it funny was it happy uh

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,559
have you been bored well all blue teams

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,320
felt difficulties because as i've told

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
you yesterday most of red teams went

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,399
into corporate networks and today

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,199
they have reached uh scada

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
two red teams have completely destroyed

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
the oil industry but what was the end of

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,719
it what do you mean by that

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,119
we realized risks are related with

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,760
pipeline discontinuation

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,720
other

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,720
risks

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
even was a fire

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,880
fire

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
well we've been playing together with

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,880
vladimir putin possibly possibly what

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
else was interesting

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,119
generally

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,479
in corporate network uh corporate bank

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,640
network and payments payments payments

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
yes tomorrow we should have some

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
payments and will the money be spread

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
around uh given to everybody well you

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
should approach vladimir

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
does he have some money in the atm or

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
not you have a last game you know

42
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,720
nothing about money you're not the money

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
a guy you're a froster guy and who do we

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
have in the banks how many teams are

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
breaking banks at least two of these two

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,759
one have already uh created a leak of

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
data

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
but it has not been accepted it has not

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
been accepted yet because there are

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
certain

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,159
uh suggestions improper report yeah

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
what letter the name of the team i'm not

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,880
going to tell you oh you tell me

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,239
sometimes you tell me everything right

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,520
now you don't tell me anything well

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
yesterday

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
this poor risk which two teams tried to

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,480
do it and they have already got two

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,440
points four points each

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
tell me please in addition to skada and

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,400
banking a segment what else was good

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
energy sector was hacked

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
what about them they have decoded the

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,360
data how many times

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
right one time

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
yeah but totally

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
no no

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
just a desktop of a top manager

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,800
well that's all right that's all right

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
and they've stole his data stole his

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,879
data which data do you know confidential

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
data oh my god

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,920
it's like an investigation in police

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
which data confidential data yeah

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,839
confidential data okay wonderful

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,120
what was so interesting

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
out of techniques or tactics or in the

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
criminal behavior well if you will look

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,239
on these can you show me with your uh uh

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
finger wove

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
well we didn't have a lot of web attacks

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,879
it means that people are inside of the

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
corporate networks well they broke

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
everything here yesterday they broke

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
everything

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,519
they don't need web attacks they already

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
have backdoors

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,840
they use

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
them i like that one of the teams uses

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
domain

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
which is similar like sock in stage but

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
with one end yes alexis was telling me

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,000
about it this morning and couple people

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
from positive said why do you have those

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
injections in the internet no

96
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
there are pt security domains why do

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,040
they do that

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
just for the fun of it

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
does it comply to the rules

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,840
these are resources in the internet that

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,239
people relate with and what

102
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
what they expect from people who go

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,680
there they have a lot of

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
files like rats some additional

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,440
resources for hacking scanning

106
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
so from the infrastructure they go to

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
these resources and they pull

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
information inside of the game and then

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
they use those resources and they use

110
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
those tools and by these they get

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,919
promoted they get stronghold and they

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
move forward etc

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
do you follow

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
who is in the top amongst attacking

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
teams there are two of them

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,840
one of them is caught by and

117
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
team and codebay

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
they've destroyed the oil industry

119
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
completely

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
in half they broke it in half they broke

121
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,680
in half almost enough

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
do you evaluate

123
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,560
somehow

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
defenders what happens on the defense

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
side

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
a daily very difficult time their life

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
is very difficult

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
uh those people who are responsible for

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
logistics it was very difficult for them

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,919
and right now some other teams had to be

131
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,080
intensified in their investigation but

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,479
none of the risks have been investigated

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
completely so no report was submitted

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
well they are submitting reports but you

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
return them it's very difficult for them

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
because uh

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
for example speaking about logistics

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
when there are 13 teams that been

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
realizing the risks it's very difficult

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
to differentiate one team from another

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,800
it's difficult when you have two teams

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
but when you have 13 yes of course you

143
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,680
can

144
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
look time-wise but you need certain

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
competency and experience

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,240
what about the global saw

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
has everything been distributed yes but

148
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,840
maybe you will tell me about it yes

149
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
we're going to tell you you're telling

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
yes we're telling you

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,240
okay let's give them a hint small hint

152
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,080
no yesterday i gave all the hints but

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
can you give me another hint no i'm not

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
i'm not going to give any hints i

155
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
already gave them a lot of hints okay

156
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,479
beautiful

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,479
what has changed with my big numbers

158
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,960
nothing have changed well uh in the

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
course of 12 hours for example today we

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
have less web attacks uh more people

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
have switched to corporate network works

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
in here we see that on the level of the

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
operating systems we have this we have a

164
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
number of events here

165
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
you know we started with the

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
universities

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
new and all vulnerabilities have been

168
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
used for the promotion getting

169
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
stronghold and moving forward and look

170
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,199
for shell is being used for penetration

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
during one of the days in minecraft

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
