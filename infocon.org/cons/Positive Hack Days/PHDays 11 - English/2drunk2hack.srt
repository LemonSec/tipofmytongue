16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,559

from organizers and and we have

20
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,719
you press the buttons and drink tequila

21
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,320

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,799
and no other rules this year we have

23
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,439

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
and the one who will get more trough is

27
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,080
it's going to be the one who would

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,720
increase his chance or her chance to

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560

you will have points points points these

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
are nothing omar forget points are

91
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
nothing the most important thing is the

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,320
trophy the point if you made a small job

93
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,639
you made some automation

94
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
you switched on the directory

95
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
so you're a real leader right this is

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,639
point

97
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,320

98
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,799
we had one similar experience and we've

391
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,120
brought neliwika to

almaty and

394
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,640
so much tequila

395
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
i've never been drinking so much tequila

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,400
neither before or after and instead of

397
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
limes we had oranges and instead of salt

398
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
there was a sugar

399
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
well to drawn to how it did work that

400
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,640
time but it was a nice event it was a

401
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
nice event and they don't make events

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,160
like that anymore

403
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,640
three rounds

404
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
three rounds and one more minute and 20

405
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,480
seconds standing between us and the end

406
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,640
of the ph days

407
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,280
that's why i used this guardian robot

408
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
then they took the clothing from the

409
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
wardrobe

410
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,570

are breaking it

414
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
and of course we're watching omar as

415
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,000

418
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,639
half a terabyte

419
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
and rest of the participants

420
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,280
i would drink tequila or maybe eat some

421
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,840
lime but omar

422
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
he didn't eat the fish

423
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,640
and you know the

424
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,039

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,080
terabyte for the last place i so i

503

those young competitors contestants

622
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,120
over 21 but below 34.

623
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200

contest

625
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,080
