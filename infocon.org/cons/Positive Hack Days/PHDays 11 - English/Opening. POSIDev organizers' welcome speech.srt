9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,480
team

and tomorrow they're here to answer your

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
questions related to our track and

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,480
we don't know the wi-fi password we

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
don't want to know the wi-fi password

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
and we don't want you to want to know

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
the wi-fi password

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
just for you to know

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
anyway

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
as far as the track is concerned and the

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,800
presentations are concerned

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
here here they are

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
and let's let's give a hand to the guys

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,840
you know their faces you know where to

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
go to

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,199
another activity that we are having

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
in this room

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
you have souvenirs right there

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
when you enter the the room you see it

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,840
and you can see alona another member of

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
our team she's waving at you oh

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
so alana will be

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,720
happy to give you

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
uh some merch in exchange of five

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,400
minutes

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
questionnaire

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
you answer the questions and in return

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
for answering the questions you get

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
fancy stuff

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
so so much for the track

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
we're in for a couple of very

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
interesting presentations

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
first half of the day we're going to

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
devote our attention to more technical

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
stuff

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,399
something related to coding to

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,680
vulnerabilities and such

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
second half of the day

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,960
meanwhile will be related to

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,119
organizational issues deaths equals

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,479
devops

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,039
etc

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,520
just a couple of words about our

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,000
community

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
probably noticed we

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
it used to be called a positive

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
development user group now we are

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
positive

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
and it's not for nothing we had a reason

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
to do that

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
we ipo'd in december

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,560
our ticker is posse just for you to know

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
and one of our activities related to ipl

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,959
was related to building communities

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
in fact series of communities

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
within the project of co-owner of our

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,760
company

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
so those are professional communities

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
that would

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,800
come together to resolve issues

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
related to our industry

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
and that would participate in developing

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,519
the products of the company and open

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,040
source projects

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
and would get

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,280
options and shares

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
in return

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,519
this platform is going to be delved upon

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,080
by one of the speakers today but anyhow

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
our community is one of the things that

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,360
we do these days that's why we're

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,319
positive

83
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
one other reason for us to be deaf

84
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
is that

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
apart from

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
defensive coding and everything related

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
to

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,840
security code analysis

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,200
vulnerabilities researchers related to

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,799
security etc

91
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
well this year and onwards

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,159
we are going to try and broaden

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
our communities activity

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,319
and let me

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,640
explain you what i mean

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
for about six years we share expertise

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
expertise related to

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
uh code security

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,400
at phd days at

100
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,959
other events we do that

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,959
and we can do that we also can do code

102
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
you know we are developers despite the

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,439
fact that we're dealing with security we

104
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,239
also do coding

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
and coding

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,439
works

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,478
to resolve pretty challenging tasks

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
and probably this is some other kind of

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
expertise that we would like to share

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
with other

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
coders

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
so

113
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,000
today and tomorrow we're in for a couple

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,479
of presentations like the one that we're

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,880
going to have right after myself about

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,080
how we did plugins for ides and this one

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
is about plugins not about research not

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
about analysis

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
so this is our

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
first try

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
and if the try is a success will develop

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
further and we'll try to

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,639
turn into

124
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
uh not just the duffsy cops community

125
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
but rather a dev developers community

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
so

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
related to that is my next request

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
those of you who got

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
free of charge tickets oh give me a show

130
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,240
of hands

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
who got our free of charge tickets

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
not too many

133
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
yes you could do that

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
uh around 50 people actually got our

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
free of charge tickets as members of our

136
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
community and this is something that we

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
do regularly

138
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
this is our qr code

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,080
and you can get it there so we give away

140
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
tickets for those who are active users

141
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
of our chat and this time we just gave

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,560
it away to all the members of the

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
community not for the track but

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
obviously to the conference both days of

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,680
the conference

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
anyway

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,320
oh boy whatever what i wanted to say

148
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
i don't really remember sorry

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
no i just wanted to show you the qr code

150
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
so that we have more people in our chat

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
oh yes right

152
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,479
i was telling you

153
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
why we are now

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
trying to dive into

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
developer community we want to

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
cover

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,840
those developers who are not yet into

158
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
the topic of security and we would like

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
to entice

160
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
interest in security in them

161
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,840
apart from that and i'm sharing a secret

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,880
for you

163
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
with you

164
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,199
we are

165
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,840
discussing the probability of opening

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,400
part of our code base including our

167
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,280
technology base

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
in particular the vm

169
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
that is in uh that is in charge of

170
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
uh code analysis and application

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
inspector we have couple of open source

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
projects that we are

173
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
prepared to start off

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
