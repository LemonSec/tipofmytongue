we forget

that

cyber transformation

22
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
boosts cyber risks

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
and any kind of risk

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,200
can multiply all our investment to zero

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
bring our investments to zero and we

would like to understand uh how

our digital initiatives and digital

transformations can reach could reach

who are you

what kind of specialists you are and

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,479
what is your opinion about digital

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
transformation and

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
digital security question one is quite

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
simple and brief

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
tell us briefly

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,879
about well we have uh a time with a lot

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,239
of events

46
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,120
digital transformation uh has been

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,760
taking place for a long time but

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
what about now what are the changes if

49
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,920
any what is the general status what is

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
the interest to the digital

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640

your companies catherine

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
you know

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,959
so the attitude to digital

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,440
transformation hasn't changed in

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
february

57
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
before and after

58
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
for several years

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
we everyone was focused on digital

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,440
transformation to a greater and greater

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
scale

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,959
and the recent events proved

63
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,840
the

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,239
that we are on the right way

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
for several years

66
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,480
i can comment on the

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,518
first point

68
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,959
digital security

69
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
can

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
come after digital transformation no

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
digital security and digital

72
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
transformation must go hand-in-hand

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
together in any kind of digital projects

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,959
i think this is only reasonable you have

75
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
to think about security from the very

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,319
beginning

77
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,510
that this is what we do in ros atom

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
this is

normal

81
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,599
digital transformation is underway no

82
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
one denies that

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
and the security is included it's very

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
strange even to imagine that it can

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
be

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,120
eliminated there were some

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,880
hypotheses and attempts i don't remember

88
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
any of them they were somewhere else in

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
a different world in my world i didn't

90
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,120
notice any of them in the last two years

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,919
when we worked online

next question will be to you the big

96
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,320
question but now please tell me briefly

97
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
what is your opinion

98
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
about

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
the general dynamics of digital

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
transformation i can only support

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
because the process of digital

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
transformation cannot be stopped

104
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
the focus might change

105
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,240
because

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
import substitution

107
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
cyber security a bit more focus on them

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
but at the level of

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
at the federal level at

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,440
indus industrial level at smb level

111
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
digital transformation is going on and i

112
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
cannot but react to the first point

113
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,039
that

114
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,479
security

115
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,880
digital transformation cannot live

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,840
without digital

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,440

intelligence artificial intelligence

119
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,560
is about any of us

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,840
it's used in health care recently we

121
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
launched

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,080
pilotless traffic project in moscow in

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
skolkovo in some other areas and these

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
technology

125
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
come very close to each and every of us

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
and without digital security without

127
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,319
thinking about new threats

128
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,280
we

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
cannot live

130
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
it's a question of morality and ethics

131
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
it's another subject

132
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
that we have to discuss and we that we

133
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
already discussed now ivan

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
i didn't introduce you properly

you are a digital identity chief digital

identity officer which is very

137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
interesting for australiacom and russia

138
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,840
in general i think you have something

139
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,039
about the change of focus uh

140
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
in the last six for the last six months

141
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,560
yes a lot of things happened

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
uh we're going to speak more about it

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
today but talking about digital

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
transformation in general what is

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
happening

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
we faced fundamental problems

147
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
that we underestimated before

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
digital transformation is moving on and

149
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
companies

150
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,120
exert a lot of efforts to substitute

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,080
foreign

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
products but fundamentally there is a

153
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,479
big shift

154
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
that we identified it's not about

155
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
infrastructure

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,919
it's

157
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,639
yesterday

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,039
many

159
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
people were sent to learn

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
python

161
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,360
but now

162
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
we train them in analytics in products

163
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
in customer experience

164
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,319
in

165
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,520
new

166
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,360
product generation new customer ways

167
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
customer journeys

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
it's a lot of things i can talk about it

169
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
for hours but the shift has taken place

170
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,080
and made

171
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
many people try to change

172
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,599
their

173
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
professional status

174
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
it's a blue ocean in front of us despite

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
all the problems that we face it's a

176
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
time for new opportunities new digital

177
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,919
transformation

178
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,879
anyway

179
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
to continue

180
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
we see that

181
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
at the business level

182
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,240
we see changes

183
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,680
and at the government level we discuss a

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
lot of things

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
that

186
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
were not quite important before

187
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,240
digital passports sovereign internet

188
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
user data security personal data

189
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,958
security

190
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,880
meta universe

191
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
this is what we discussed now and it's

192
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
very interesting what has happened uh

193
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,600
became a catalyze a catalyst

194
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
for those subjects

195
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
they are not paper documents they are

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,600
real problems for us now elia

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
you are head of the center of competence

198
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,279
now

199
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
strategies

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
are already

201
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
have already been written what about you

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
what has changed

203
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
thank you

204
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
yes

205
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
i am head of

206
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
import substitution center of influence

207
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
a center of competence that was set up

208
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,480
by

209
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,600
the presidential decree in 2015

210
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
2016

211
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
and we realized that digital

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
transformation

213
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
has to become

214
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
part of the

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
business core in russia

216
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,880
companies government agencies

217
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
started without

218
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
digital technologies you cannot operate

219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,399
at all

220
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,279
and at that time

221
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,800
many people

222
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
believed that i

223
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
was

224
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
an old timer but i said if we change the

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
paradigm

226
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
we have to

227
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,640
focus on local

228
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
russian russian-based

229
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,519
uh products and services

230
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
because anything can happen

231
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
and it really happens

232
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
it's not

233
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,000
yet happen until the end

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
there is something else

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
to follow

236
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
there is no there

237
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,040
haven't been any really destructive

238
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,910
steps made at a certain point we got

239
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,360
[Music]

240
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,519
work with hackers internal extruders

241
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
but

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
vendor activities

243
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
were excluded

244
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
there was a disclaimer

245
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
we protect against

246
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,119
internal

247
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,680
intruders external cyber criminals not

248
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,959
about vendor activities if any

249
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
and the companies that generated their

250
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,560
strategies focused on russian based

251
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
technologies

252
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,920
70

253
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,720
russian 30 non-russian that was the

254
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,600
target but now the situation has changed

255
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,560
and we have to review those figures and

256
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
tears

257
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
and the target is

258
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,399
to

259
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,360
exclude

260
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
inappropriate

261
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
damage

262
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
unacceptable damage should be eliminated

263
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,440
and we saw attempts to incur such

264
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
damage in the last two to three months

265
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
so you have a lot

266
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,959
of work to do a lot more work to do

267
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,920
of course we didn't expect such events

268
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,479
but those events took place actually

269
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,639
unfortunately and we have to react

270
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,880
yes

271
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
so we didn't have any illusions from

272
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,880
2014

273
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,760
on

274
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
but in general if we look at the russian

275
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,440
history russia

276
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,920
was without sanctions for two weeks

277
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
in its

278
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
modern history

279
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
unfriendly actions

280
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,120
were expected and import substitution

281
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
trend didn't

282
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
start

283
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
yesterday or on february 24 it started

284
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,839
in 2014

285
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
when we

286
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,040
talked about digital transformation

287
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,720
we noticed that transformation is

288
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
continuously transforming

289
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,839
we are changing our digital

290
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
transformation document the general

291
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,360
targets are the same but the ways to

292
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
those targets

293
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
are

294
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,800
changed from time to time

295
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,120
and this is not a negative trend

296
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,399
actually for example

297
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,320
we

298
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
corrected our digital strategy when we

299
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
signed agreement with the government

300
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
to develop quantum calculations and

301
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
development of new

302
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
manufacturing technologies

303
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
digital economy you know

304
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
this is the area that we

305
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,480
interact uh quite closely

306
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,760
and our target

307
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,480
was fixed in 2017

308
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,399
with the government

309
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
government ross

310
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,920
and rostec

311
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
to

312
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,560
ensure

313
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,760
the

314
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,120
independence

315
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
of

316
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
manufacturing software

317
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,560
ot software

318
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
operational technologies

319
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,040
and every year digitization subject is

320
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,600
amended and this is only normal it has

321
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
to change

322
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,199
two years ago

323
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,279
the pandemic

324
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
generated some changes now

325
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
there is some other factor that should

326
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
remain nameless

327
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,959
that forces us to do that sergey now you

328
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,079
promised

329
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,600
a big picture please switch on

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
the presentation

331
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,240
and

332
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,399
in the chat there are questions that you

333
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,560
have to answer let me

334
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
try to tell you what happens at the

335
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
government level

336
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,120
what happens about digital

337
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
transformation

338
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
our organization is a business partner

339
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
of the government in the national

340
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,760
program area i'll tell you about the

341
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,480
three packages that were introduced and

342
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,839
how they work

343
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
the digital transformation as a notion

344
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,760
now was first introduced

345
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,279
in 2020 by the president and the targets

346
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,000
were fixed to

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,320
2030 there are three four areas digital

348
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,880
maturity of key

349
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,440
industries and social areas 97 of

350
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
households

351
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
have to be connected to broadband

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
internet access 95

353
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
of socially important services must be

354
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
digitized

355
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
and

356
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,839
investment in local digital technologies

357
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,920
should be increased by four times

358
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
digital economy

359
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,560
is a national program

360
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
which has to

361
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,759
be completed by 2014 and it creates a

362
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
basis for

363
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
uh digital transformation its

364
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,600
development of new digital technologies

365
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
regulatory base

366
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,040
artificial intelligence

367
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
data security and digitization of

368
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
governments

369
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
government services

370
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,479
besides

371
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
the ministry of digital uh development

372
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
introduced

373
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,120
packages of i.t

374
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,680
industry support the first one

375
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,759
was introduced in 2020 2021

376
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,800
for russia it created and it created

377
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,880
exclusive conditions

378
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,000
they resemble offshore

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
when

380
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,559
tax payments were reduced

381
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,720
income tax was reduced and vat was

382
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
eliminated

383
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,119
but not for all the companies only for

384
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,319
those

385
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,880
which 90 percent of revenues generate

386
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
from

387
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,359
selling software licenses second package

388
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,959
with a lot of

389
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,720
market players 200 companies

390
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
it hasn't been completed it's in the

391
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
process of completion

392
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,640
but i think we have significant progress

393
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,679
here ross atom is part of the process

394
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
ross telecoms beer

395
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
and other big companies

396
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,400
the road map was signed in 2021 in

397
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,679
september

398
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,880
and it's

399
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
actively

400
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,080
implemented in 20 areas

401
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
emergency measures are well known

402
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,960
because every day they are discussed in

403
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
mass media

404
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
most of the areas

405
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
already implemented in some areas we

406
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
still negotiate with the ministry of

407
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,520
finance

408
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,320
in addition to those measures

409
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,600
which include uh

410
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
loans

411
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,039
with reduced interest reduction of

412
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,120
administrative workload reduction of uh

413
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
important

414
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,799
interest rates

415
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,600
and

416
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
there is

417
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,200
headquarters in the ministry of digital

418
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,880
development and we have 34 areas

419
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,000
and in 34

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,480
aids to the minister

421
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,679
who

422
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,559
work

423
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,320
in each of those 34 areas

424
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
what is the results first of all

425
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,000
income or revenues from i.t services

426
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
then

427
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,960
taxes tax payments

428
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
grow

429
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,840
import and export also grows and the

430
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,840
number of employees grows

431
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,120
here in all the four

432
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,200
slides we have a big

433
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,720
asterisk because this is the analytics

434
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,679
for 2021. we don't have any data for

435
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,440
2022.

436
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,600
it's very difficult to evaluate the

437
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
recent events

438
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,320
but in general

439
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,360
i would like to announce one more point

440
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
about our organization

set up the first digital transformation

443
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
media

444
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,280
where we tell

445
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440

446
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
of industries and regions best practices

447
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
of digitization and we and

448
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
you can see interviews with our

449
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,280
digitization

450
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
leaders please subscribe

451
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,760

453

those measures we have a lot of them

454
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
we talked about uh support measures of

455
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,840
the ministry of uh digital ministry of

456
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
digital development but the ministry of

457
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,799
industry and ministry of trade they have

458

they operate at the level of subjects of

464
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,639
the russian federation at the government

465
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,320
governor of the russian

466
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
regions level then we have a

467
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240
book

468
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,320
from thomas siebel about digital

469
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
transformation we translated it and

470
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,039
published it and we have a

471
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,000
manual which helps you to find

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
appropriate

473
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,559
information

474
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,720
and learn

475
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
whatever you have to learn that's all i

476
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
wanted to say good

477
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,320
now i see

478
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,120
a lot of things

479
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,240
about digital security and how to

480
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,480
survive in the

481
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
year of digital transformation so we

482
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,720
looked at the support measures uh would

483
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,600
you like to add anything or shall we

484
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
dwell on it

485
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
later in principle

486
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
the events

487
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,559
from february

488
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,400
were quite dynamic in terms of industry

489
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
support

490
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,679
the government

491
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,120
turned

492
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
to the companies

493
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,158
their employees

494
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,919
towards new startups

495
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,039
with certain benefits and decrees

496
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,039
talking about digital security there

497
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,840
were two presidential decrees one

498
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
about

499
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
about prohibition of

500
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
foreign software

501
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,480
in critical

502
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,559
objects

503
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,679
prohibition will start in

504
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,159
2025 and then there is a second decree

505
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,280
about elimination of foreign-based

506
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
cybersecurity products so everything is

507
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,480
all right why at the government level

508
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,280
why at the president level i can explain

509
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,840
because in 2014

510
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,520
we have

511
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,720
president obama who helped me to

512
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,799
substitute import because president

513
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,720
obama

514
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,360
introduced sanctions and said he

515
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,159
said i'm going to ruin russian

516
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,559
industry so he helped me quite a lot

517
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
we started thinking about

518
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,799
something else because ibm is still here

519
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,440
microsoft is here our people are

520
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,720
employed

521
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,080
but they are

522
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,600
under the ceo who is in the united

523
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,360
states under obama and now everyone says

524
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,400
openly about implementation of

525
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,360
unacceptable sanctions

526
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
unacceptable

527
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,720
influences against russia against our

528
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
public

529
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
a lot of sanctions have been introduced

530
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,520
but several of them were painful

531
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
about high-tech

532
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,639
industry in particular

533
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,440
japan imposed sanctions

534
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,039
about

535
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,880
lathes

536
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,200
about electronic microscopes

537
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,520
the rank and file person doesn't

538
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
understand what it means but for us it's

539
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
clear that they try to

540
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,760
stop development

541
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,880
of digital transformation by

542
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
using non-economic

543
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,760
measures

544
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,480
and so this is how it happens everywhere

545
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,760
in the industry if quantum computing

546
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
is something that people don't

547
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,120
understand a lot

548
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,520
by the way myself included i need some

549
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,640
education

550
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,440
but then the i.t component

551
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,559
is the same the cpus

552
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,600
the

553
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
machines

554
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
for a circuit board

555
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
production

556
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,840
software for

557
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,240
engineering analysis or engineering

558
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,200
modeling and everything

559
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
being done

560
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,120
to

561
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,679
stop the development of the country and

562
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,960
inflicting an inadmissible damage to it

563
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
in addition to hacker attacks

564
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,199
thank you thank you in our chat

565
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,199
people are asking our writing

566
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,039
it's

567
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,080
no surprise that most people here are

568
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
information security professionals which

569
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,320
is quite good because not always

570
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,840
information security people are getting

571
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
to digital transformation or as we all

572
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,600
know the digital transformation is sure

573
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,360
to get to them

574
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,919
uh 70 percent of the entities are

575
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,480
implementing digital transformation

576
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
so what we said that a lot of companies

577
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,279
are indeed

578
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
seeing

579
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
a point doing that

580
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,200
and the next answers

581
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
uh make me a bit wary

582
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,279
so is cyber security included in digital

583
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,480
transformation

584
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,039
less than 60 percent say yes

585
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,000
24

586
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
say no

587
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
and i'd like to note that those who are

588
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,240
saying no

589
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
they don't have digital transformation

590
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
do you think so yes indeed

591
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
it's very strange

592
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
according to all the recommendations is

593
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
security should be included

594
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
it's the same as

595
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,919
to say

596
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,320
so we don't use computers anymore

597
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
so for me it looks

598
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
about the same

599
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,080
another thing is that look cyber

600
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,880
security is being built differently on

601
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,000
the one hand they can build a fence

602
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
and just say that we do have cyber

603
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,679
security

604
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,760
here for instance the example they're

605
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,159
using the example of all these models

606
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
that's being run in phd we see

607
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,159
that fences can be broken through

608
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,760
so cyber security and digital

609
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,640
transformation should be integrated

610
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,440
into the core into the essence of the

611
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
business logic of the applications and

612
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
systems themselves

613
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,200
not just defense

614
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
i once

615
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,960
visited a nuclear power plant and saw

616
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,039
how security is being implemented there

617
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,440
yes there is a fence but

618
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,399
after the fence they have dozens

619
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,080
of virtual fences that do not allow

620
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,679
an inadmissible damage to happen so the

621
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,000
task for all companies is not just to

622
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
build cyber security through installing

623
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,600
some firewalls or

624
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,960
antiviruses or cms and so on but

625
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,320
so that inside the systems

626
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
the protection security measures

627
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,440
should be included

628
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
both from destructive external uh

629
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,960
influences and internal attacks yes

630
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
thank you

631
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,640
well there's quite a lot of intelligence

632
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
here and let me remind you what we saw

633
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,480
in the public sphere in terms of

634
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
information security of the past six

635
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
months we saw

636
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,799
massive leaks

637
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,840
and unfortunately we all know uh such

638
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,960
names as yandex jedi and picabo

639
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
we've seen

640
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
spoofing

641
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
and

642
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,039
mass media

643
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,000
outlets were attacked such as tas we

644
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,279
also saw attacks on manufacturing

645
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,480
i remember a story about celiac and the

646
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,799
measurement of temperature in

647
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,039
the refrigerators according to our

648
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,559
statistic

649
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,559
it can be seen

650
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,559
that there's a growth in attacks it's

651
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,120
not such a big growth but where we saw a

652
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
big growth is that 70 percent of attacks

653
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,640
became targeted in the past we saw a

654
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,840
distribution

655
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,279
uh like

656
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
the targeted tax were less than uh 50

657
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,320
there was a broad front

658
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
private individuals companies now 70

659
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,000
attacks are clearly targeted

660
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,799
and the purpose is either to steal the

661
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,360
data or disrupt the operation

662
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,520
what else

663
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,000
the techniques are quite standard

664
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,520
the

665
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,520
hacking the breaking through

666
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,520
the ransomware is in the top as usual

667
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,039
but they're also clearers cleaners

668
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
if after the ransomware uh something uh

669
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,679
could be restored but the cleaners uh

670
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,840
just to delete all the data and

671
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,480
uh it to be restored let me remind you

672
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
after all

673
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
among all these new threats there's also

674
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,919
a positive aspect that we've noticed as

675
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,320
part of the information security project

676
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,039
there was a separate track about a phone

677
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,159
fraud and the size of phone frauds

678
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,440
grew down

679
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,919
uh 10 times uh

680
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,960
after the events it was clear where

681
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,799
these phone calls were coming from

682
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,279
it looks like they switched to

683
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,840
more substantial assets

684
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,919
her colleagues we've discussed and i

685
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:18,960
think

686
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
it's

687
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,600
obvious that cyber uh security should be

688
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
part of digital transformation

689
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,640
uh forming its warp and weft i think

690
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
you have experience implementing not

691
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,520
just a digital transformation but

692
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,760
implementing large-scale digital

693
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,559
initiatives that have cyber

694
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,279
security technology included let's say

695
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,480
biometrics

696
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
biometrics basically it's a security

697
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,279
technology can you talk about that

698
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,600
what activities are happening anywhere

699
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,159
cyber security digital transformation

700
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,320
is

701
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,799
playing the biggest role

702
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
yes indeed we have a big initiative we

703
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,399
uh call it a digital identity the

704
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,960
purpose of this identity is

705
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
to assure

706
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,760
a

707
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,679
complete ability of an individual or an

708
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,200
organization

709
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,000
to

710
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,240
be a legal agent

711
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,080
it has a lot of technologies digital

712
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,559
signature technologies to

713
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
process big data and so on and so forth

714
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,679
so taking together these technologies

715
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,320
have already got a status of digital

716
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
passport today and these technologies

717
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,640
can be used to receive services through

718
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,960
the internet but where the internet is

719
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,200
present where digital technologies are

720
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,120
present a lot of threads are coming into

721
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
the bargain and so

722
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
in

723
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,120
addition to the traditional things we as

724
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,279
we are developing this project are

725
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,039
formulating the task of how to survive

726
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,080
in digital transformation not just to

727
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,000
uh perform this digital transformation

728
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
but by surviving it

729
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
there are a lot of suffer points there

730
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,720
and i'd like to dwell on several of them

731
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,360
firstly cyber security as such or

732
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,000
information security

733
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,480
in our case has become

734
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,600
a close friend and brother

735
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
and brother-in-law are norms that

736
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,440
comes hand-in-hand with the project with

737
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,159
a product why so because unfortunately

738
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
the technologies that exist in the real

739
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,279
world when they are brought into the

740
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,480
digital world

741
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,919
they require a a set of additional tools

742
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,559
such as cryptography neural networks and

743
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,360
so on and so forth

744
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,720
that

745
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,799
already exist on the on the one hand on

746
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,519
the other hand are quite novel and you

747
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,880
need to

748
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,799
you know get to grips with them so

749
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,039
creating a community

750
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,279
involving both the government

751
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,960
organizations and services and business

752
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,080
and it is that has given a good effect

753
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,519
on the one hand to overcome uh the

754
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
paper-based rate tape a red tape

755
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,399
and on the other one on the other hand

756
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,760
to take a clear view of problems that

757
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,240
exist both in russia and across the

758
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,200
world

759
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,120
we of course

760
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,080
are looking at what colleagues are doing

761
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
across the border

762
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,440
so the first

763
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,960
part is super community maybe

764
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,799
it sounds to you

765
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,159
it sounds quite

766
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,399
uh

767
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,799
banal for the i.t people

768
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,039
because in development it's a usual

769
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,640
story

770
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,519
but a community in cyber security is

771
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,159
something new and we don't know a lot

772
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,559
about that but the second story is of

773
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,440
course

774
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,320
about the fact that when creating a

775
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,080
digital service you won't be able

776
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,279
to

777
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,360
use only the traditional

778
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,080
security tools and measures

779
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,279
and

780
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,080
even

781
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,320
the traditional attack and threat models

782
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,760
are not enough

783
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,879
so question arises about

784
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,918
research

785
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:10,960
for instance

786
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,679
we ran into a problem of normalizing

787
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,960
neural networks because we're working in

788
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
biometric technologies deep fake it

789
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,199
technologies uh that are attacking this

790
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,960
digital identity we understand that a

791
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,480
lot of uh

792
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
developments both in this country and in

793
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,918
other countries uh have been have come

794
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,639
up

795
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
and they've been tested both abroad in

796
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,040
this country but nobody has learned to

797
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,359
work with aggregating the results and

798
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,719
working out

799
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,760
a unified measurement scale

800
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,719
to understand if it's an attack or is it

801
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,359
just a recognition of a specific

802
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,280
biometric image

803
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,040
so

804
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,839
aren't there any uh back doors in the

805
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,679
neural networks as such

806
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
of course it's serious it's serious

807
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,359
research serious research is required

808
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,760
for that and even professionals are few

809
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
and far between that's the second story

810
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
and the first story

811
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,320
is

812
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,960
lies in these sphere of business models

813
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,720
because traditionally information

814
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
security

815
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,560
is

816
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,000
worked on with their own

817
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,520
security

818
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,880
departments and divisions in large

819
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,040
organizations there are professionals

820
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,079
who have certificates and

821
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,760
smaller organizations small and medium

822
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
businesses

823
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,760
need to outsource this function

824
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,200
we have chosen yet another approach

825
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,598
which might sound a little bit radical

826
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,800
we've taken it from other business

827
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,520
models not related with digital identity

828
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,599
we've followed the new sharings

829
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,640
[Music]

830
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
when we were

831
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,359
offering an opportunity to use

832
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,800
the solutions

833
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,240
of

834
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,560
third-party vendors and test them on our

835
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
products and offering them an

836
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,119
opportunity to

837
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,520
earn on our projects

838
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
so taking together these three

839
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,240
approaches gave very good synergy on the

840
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,520
one hand we improved our own proficiency

841
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
in information security on the other

842
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,599
hand we gave an opportunity to vendors

843
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,920
not only large ones but also small ones

844
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
to have their products and solutions

845
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,480
tested

846
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,359
and gain access to the capital that

847
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,880
will help them continue their r d well

848
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,320
thank you very much i had a lot of

849
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,119
exciting things and i think a special

850
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,720
presentation can be made about what you

851
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
just said but what needs to be focused

852
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,839
on when we said about digital

853
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,839
transformation we're talking uh about

854
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,440
changing a business model and now you

855
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
just mentioned a new business model

856
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,560
applied

857
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,839
to create a service on

858
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,640
uh

859
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
cyber security they've taken revenue

860
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
sharing uh they've taken crypto

861
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
technology and they started it all uh

862
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
when i uh read about

863
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,920
different initiatives and startups i'm

864
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,800
struck

865
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,040
by how few and far between are the

866
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,960
stories about

867
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,079
digital transformation

868
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,960
can i respond

869
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,240
after the events of the 24th of february

870
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,960
we

871
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,240
thought

872
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,680
about convening several expert

873
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
meetings so that large business should

874
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
share their experience how they've

875
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,680
overcome this pressure how they've

876
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,880
restructured

877
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,000
their infrastructure

878
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
and we couldn't

879
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,160
bring together

880
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,920
this expert

881
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,720
community because people started saying

882
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,880
why should we disclose

883
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,640
our vulnerability and how we're

884
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,480
providing for infamy security it's a

885
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,560
direct challenge to hackers

886
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,320
so they should find these bottlenecks

887
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,560
and try to break them

888
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
so in this

889
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,880
sense i think it's even good that

890
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,440
not everything about cyber security is

891
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,000
publicly available is this discussion is

892
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
not always public uh but nevertheless it

893
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,839
doesn't mean that the new technologies

894
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,000
are not being developed it can be seen

895
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
by what kind of discussions are being

896
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,960
conducted in closed working groups on

897
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
information security and also was

898
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,280
presented here at the exhibition we see

899
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,800
a lot of new solutions

900
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
you're totally right and also

901
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,240
we are seeing

902
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,599
some new and more active demands

903
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,320
to build business on cyber security so

904
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,160
companies who

905
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,800
didn't use to

906
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,040
do cyber security as a business

907
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,599
are now showing a serious interest in

908
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,240
order to build a business like that

909
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,560
to create some added value for

910
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,400
themselves and also for the market

911
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,560
commercially

912
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,520
again

913
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,079
it comes back to mind that in many

914
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,240
countries including ours the regulatory

915
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,280
driver

916
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,440
is a must it needs a good push in the

917
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
right direction

918
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,880
uh india

919
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,839
can you

920
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,720
enlighten us on the uh regulations is

921
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,000
anything happening

922
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,480
to overcome these challenges

923
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
of course uh it's always lagging behind

924
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,119
uh it's always like behind here it's not

925
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,400
too bad well maybe but

926
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,680
for digital transformation

927
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,400
new

928
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,880
directives and methodology

929
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,079
recommendations are going to be

930
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,640
published shortly as i said for cyber

931
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
security the focus

932
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,839
is

933
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,078
to

934
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,720
make

935
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,560
leaders of the companies personally

936
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
responsible and by the way in other

937
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,720
countries it produces effect

938
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,359
the regulatory environment

939
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,280
is of course one thing but it's also

940
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,320
important

941
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,040
that your own conscious i guess changed

942
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,200
because digital transformation is not

943
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,440
going to happen uh without people who

944
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,079
are going to uh perform it and that's

945
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,839
hoping uh that

946
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,079
in the past five years so we've been

947
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,400
able to break the mentality

948
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,680
to use

949
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,960
you know

950
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
shrink wrapped western

951
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,640
systems also

952
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,599
consulting patterns how transformation

953
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,599
should be done and so on and so forth in

954
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,480
addition to it i used to work with

955
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
aviation

956
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,720
and aviation is

957
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
a sphere

958
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,319
that people are talking a lot about i

959
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,240
can tell you that in aviation in

960
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
military aviation the biggest secret

961
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,200
is not really about the structure uh of

962
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,920
the airframe or the engines uh or even

963
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,359
the military applications the biggest

964
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,400
secret

965
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
is uh the uh system uh to this friend of

966
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,280
our system

967
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,599
uh that

968
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,400
if you take the soviet time

969
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,800
a guy once went to japan on mig-25 it

970
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,440
was quite a good uh aircraft

971
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,960
so people here got scared not because

972
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,880
technologies uh would be stolen

973
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,920
but

974
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,599
that this was a

975
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,040
military

976
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,839
aircraft that had this friend of oh

977
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,400
system

978
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,160
no if you

979
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,960
see that some aircrafts

980
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,480
are

981
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
falling from

982
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,640
aircraft carriers

983
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,200
they would you know extract them from

984
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,240
the depths of up to 3000 meters not

985
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,200
because

986
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,119
they're afraid of losing the aircraft

987
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,839
but because they don't want uh to have

988
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,960
their friend of all system compromised

989
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,280
so because that will break the entire

990
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,400
security

991
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,200
environment in cyber security there are

992
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,880
similar systems and one has to

993
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,359
understand

994
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,880
i mean large companies have to

995
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
understand that if it's not a russian

996
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,319
vendor then the trust to them should not

997
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,760
be too high

998
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,359
because they're using their own friend

999
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,760
of o system and no

1000
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,119
hackers

1001
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,720
are needed for them

1002
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,960
to produce a disruptive effect so this

1003
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,839
capability is there by

1004
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,079
in the system

1005
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,000
so therefore

1006
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,960
the

1007
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,680
task for us

1008
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,240
is not to hope uh on

1009
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,560
foreign solutions

1010
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
so it's not an option to use a foreign

1011
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,520
system

1012
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
either in cyber security or

1013
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,839
in core systems

1014
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,480
they're all very vulnerable at this

1015
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,119
day and age

1016
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,000
let me add a few things about friend of

1017
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,800
all

1018
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,440
friend of foe

1019
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
this approach has a peculiarity you

1020
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,440
remember

1021
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,240
a children's fairy tale

1022
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,960
so

1023
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,200
our mother has come home to bring some

1024
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,800
milk but actually that was a

1025
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,839
wolf

1026
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,480
in mother's

1027
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,520
dress so this is one story with another

1028
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,680
story is about educating your own

1029
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,160
employees talk about the recent trends

1030
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,640
what has indeed changed

1031
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,160
in

1032
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,200
the attitude to cyber security of course

1033
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,880
it's about getting not only

1034
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,760
security professionals involved

1035
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
but

1036
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,440
also

1037
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,119
representatives of

1038
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,640
other

1039
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,920
business areas

1040
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,520
number ones i mean uh top executives

1041
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,880
we already have a lot of examples where

1042
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,200
the top executives of the companies are

1043
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,919
getting involved

1044
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,440
in

1045
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,920
solving uh the

1046
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,119
tasks

1047
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,599
affecting the business not

1048
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,599
in terms of which firewall is installed

1049
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,520
or which av system

1050
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,560
is installed but what exactly it needs

1051
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
to be protected in the first place

1052
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,640
from the business perspective

1053
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,079
it's also about

1054
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,359
building up

1055
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,680
the output of

1056
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,400
security professionals

1057
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,359
it's about including uh regulations uh

1058
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,520
that will

1059
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,359
help protect yourselves from an attack

1060
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,680
also i'd like to add

1061
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,079
a another trend about regulations it's

1062
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,960
about deregulation for certain niches to

1063
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,400
implement ai technologies

1064
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,240
these are called experimental legal

1065
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,440
modes

1066
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,720
so-called

1067
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,920
that

1068
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,200
are applied

1069
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,800
to

1070
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
driverless vehicles

1071
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,440
to telemeds and so this is about

1072
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,920
providing digital technologies a way

1073
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,520
to be implemented on a faucet on a fast

1074
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,160
track track

1075
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,520
by allowing certain legal regulations

1076
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,680
and not to be applied to them

1077
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,359
so

1078
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,240
once

1079
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,280
this

1080
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,359
is allowed uh then uh for four or six

1081
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,319
months

1082
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,280
uh these requirements can be lifted uh

1083
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,680
allowing the technologies uh to be tried

1084
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,079
and tested uh in uh real life much

1085
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,520
faster well thank you i have indeed been

1086
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,079
caught up by the story about using the

1087
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,800
friend of foe

1088
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,880
concept

1089
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,760
in information security because this is

1090
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,880
exactly

1091
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,800
what we need to understand in the first

1092
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,680
place

1093
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,440
so what's happening

1094
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,280
by a legit user or what's happening

1095
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,000
by an unauthorized individual

1096
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,440
so that we could

1097
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,560
respond

1098
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,599
in time uh before

1099
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,319
any unwanted damage is inflicted so

1100
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,920
colleagues i

1101
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,160
am eager uh to continue discussions we

1102
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,520
had questions about

1103
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,000
economics uh profitability i think we're

1104
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,480
going to come back these are great

1105
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,440
topics but we're kind of short in time

1106
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,359
so i'd like to ask you

1107
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,880
one question so we're living in the

1108
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,160
world that

1109
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,800
we have everybody has a company of its

1110
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,200
own of their own their background but

1111
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,880
perhaps we are also able uh to make the

1112
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
work uh that

1113
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,359
we are dealing with more comfortable

1114
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,839
uh including information security uh

1115
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,839
let's just try and understand

1116
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,400
and

1117
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,880
articulate what

1118
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,960
kinds of comforts

1119
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,240
should exist in information security on

1120
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,960
cyber security what do we wish how can

1121
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,200
look

1122
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,160
is it a question do we have two hours

1123
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,000
for that

1124
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,920
oh maybe another couple of hours and now

1125
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,440
briefly

1126
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,480
it's the cyber security event

1127
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,440
near uh provides

1128
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
for not inflicting

1129
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,240
the any damage whether it's economic or

1130
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,119
political or reputational

1131
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:19,920
to

1132
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,559
the company

1133
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,720
and i would not even fear to mention the

1134
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,520
state because inflicting

1135
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,680
even a reputational

1136
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,240
damage to the state

1137
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,119
will

1138
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,760
recoil to affect all companies i would

1139
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,319
also include the inaction that can also

1140
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,079
bring

1141
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,640
about the damage yes but what we're

1142
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,000
saying uh what should cyber security be

1143
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,400
like it should protect us from actions

1144
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,200
or

1145
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,880
inability to act

1146
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,680
inflicting a damage i think it's too

1147
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,079
generally a question to give

1148
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,319
a specific answer i would focus once

1149
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,480
again the digital technologies and the

1150
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,040
artificial intelligence

1151
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,960
bringing new risks and threats on the

1152
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,280
other hand they open new opportunities

1153
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,720
so as for me

1154
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,119
i don't think that there's any

1155
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,079
technology that's going to be

1156
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,400
rolled out in russia

1157
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,200
that

1158
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,520
could be replicated allowed to be

1159
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,839
replicated or without

1160
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,000
reviewing its security

1161
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,800
so

1162
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,040
once a technology goes to the pilot

1163
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,559
phase so it's more often than not that

1164
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,760
this phase

1165
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,640
the threat model is start is being

1166
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,839
reviewed

1167
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,280
and i think

1168
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,119
it's very important that this dialogue

1169
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,800
should start

1170
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,280
as early as possible so that by the time

1171
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,319
that the technology uh is uh deployed uh

1172
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:57,040
specific uh requirements should uh be

1173
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,079
determined or defined so all on the

1174
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,400
other hand so the cyber security should

1175
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,040
be flexible and agile

1176
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,960
so

1177
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,040
understanding how that maybe the object

1178
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,119
of protection is not yet there but we

1179
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,119
have tools to protect them

1180
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,960
yes this is exactly how it happened with

1181
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,880
digital technology and artificial

1182
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,400
intelligence the old model where we use

1183
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,559
defense around to protect everything it

1184
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,119
doesn't work anymore because ai

1185
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,880
produces new synthetic data

1186
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,640
it's the result of work can also

1187
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,040
be a new object that

1188
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,920
we

1189
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,480
have not yet known so in this sense

1190
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,960
information security should

1191
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,000
shift

1192
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,119
to be more agile more flexible

1193
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,160
to be able to address risks new risks

1194
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,960
well judging but by what you

1195
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,520
mentioned talking about statistics this

1196
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,520
is the essence of cyber security

1197
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,400
uh interventions here

1198
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,880
cyber security and everything at least

1199
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,559
are what i've been dealing with as part

1200
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,960
of my work i have a mathematics

1201
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,880
background a lot of experience

1202
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,720
in programming so it's all about the

1203
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,040
logic of thinking about mathematics

1204
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,119
about the understanding of the nature of

1205
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,839
information technologies what's

1206
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,760
base in the basis of it so my generation

1207
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,960
well maybe i look young but in fact i'm

1208
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,079
quite old

1209
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,839
so in my generation

1210
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:30,640
when

1211
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,440
we

1212
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
went to universities

1213
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,359
most people wanted to become an

1214
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,680
economist or a lawyer

1215
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,559
but

1216
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,520
quite few people well actually

1217
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,359
very few people

1218
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,720
went to become a mathematician

1219
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,280
and this resulted in a situation where

1220
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,040
the leaders and companies

1221
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,880
are people who have no mathematical

1222
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,720
education

1223
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,280
in their background but frankly in all

1224
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,319
projects that i had to deal with

1225
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,480
and by the way i've talked to guys here

1226
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,640
who hack systems and those who protect

1227
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,799
these systems and frankly

1228
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,720
i haven't

1229
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,280
found anything a super secret in what

1230
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,200
they are doing with the methods that

1231
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
you're using

1232
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,960
in the foundation of all the most

1233
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,680
effective ways to

1234
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,880
penetrate

1235
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,520
in the digital city is logic

1236
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,880
and the more

1237
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,200
we are going to share this information

1238
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,640
we just don't have this culture by the

1239
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,960
way in this country

1240
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,280
now the problem

1241
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,119
goes way beyond

1242
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,640
a separate

1243
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,880
company it goes

1244
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,520
to the scale of the whole country

1245
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,079
so the more prepared we are to share the

1246
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,119
cooler we're going to get and

1247
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,839
the last analogy a lot of people a lot

1248
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,000
used to be said about fintech

1249
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,960
saying that we have central bank uh it

1250
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,000
makes uh exhausts a lot of efforts to

1251
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,240
build fintech but with fintech there's a

1252
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,200
problem

1253
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,359
it's the problem of very low financial

1254
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,280
and partly digital

1255
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,440
uh

1256
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,520
level of understanding in the population

1257
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,599
the literacy in the population

1258
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,079
so we have this very low level

1259
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,960
of basic knowledge about what it's all

1260
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,599
about uh why it's needed what was to be

1261
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:28,640
done with it

1262
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,920
if

1263
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,040
we pay attention to this

1264
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,200
we have well-developed companies here

1265
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,240
positive kaspersky and others

1266
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,520
so a lot of companies who deal with

1267
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,160
security second important point is

1268
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,920
security should be invisible for end

1269
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,839
users

1270
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,280
and third it should be convenient

1271
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,800
for end users because you can

1272
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,720
set up such security that no one will

1273
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,440
use the product but it will be

1274
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,440
100 security secure we're talking about

1275
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,760
digital transformation and digital

1276
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,680
becomes core

1277
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,800
of

1278
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,359
the company's business

1279
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,800
interaction with

1280
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,400
customers

1281
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,880
population you can make

1282
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,520
absolutely secure

1283
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,440
interaction but no one will use it

1284
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,040
so point one

1285
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,839
should be clear it should be local

1286
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,720
locally based locally generated

1287
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,680
in its basis not on the surface but

1288
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,800
deeply inside

1289
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,559
it could be ibm inside and on top

1290
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,160
a russian

1291
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,440
shell we have such examples so it should

1292
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,040
be russian on top and russian inside in

1293
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,520
the core thank you colleagues we need

1294
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,960
more time of course

1295
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,359
i'm

1296
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,720
not going to summarize because i sent

1297
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,280
the summary to the chat the questions

1298
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,400
were interesting the answers even more

1299
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,319
interesting we're going to take them

1300
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,720
into consideration i would like to thank

1301
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,480
you all

1302
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,119
and i wish you to continue your

1303
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,760
productive operations

1304
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,100
thank you

1305
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,429
[Applause]
