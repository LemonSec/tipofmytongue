1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,200
one chinese classic said crisis is a

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,120
time of opportunities opportunities for

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
the development of new business models

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,240
new or still not well developed as they

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,800
could be developed at this moment of

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
time and right now we're going to speak

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,960
about the mssp markets managed security

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,560
service providers

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,560
which are well known abroad but in

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,480
russia until recently it was

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
insignificant we're going to speak about

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
it together with anton alexander the

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,920
head of the development business

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
department positive technologies and

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,200
romanov cinecom the head of the

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,040
department of execution of security

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
vision hi guys

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,840
hello

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
hello

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
well in the beginning let's clear it up

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,039
what do you mean in your understanding

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,320
in russian

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
uh concept that there is a certain

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,960
specifics what is mssp model

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
modeling ssp

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,879
mssp model

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,000
it's more about the sales model

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
roughly speaking when there's a vendor

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,320
which manifest develops the software

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,159
there is a client

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,960
uh it's a software priest who wants to

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,840
acquire this software but for some

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,080
reason it's not able to purchase it but

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
even support because sometimes software

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,159
requires exploitation with help of

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,799
highly qualified specialists

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,520
so we can be helped by mssp provider

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,479
it's an organization provider

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,680
a certain data center provider which has

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
the capacities and qualified specialists

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,119
and following the mssp model they

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,799
purchase this software in the basis of

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,920
this software they provide services to

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,560
the clients

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,159
can you add something about russian

46
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,360
understanding of many security service

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
providers

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
yes i can

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
add to this mssp first of all it's a

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
service

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,439
which includes software hardware and

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
people

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
which have expertise so the main part in

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,319
mssp is that client receives some

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,680
additional

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
product or service

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,800
the main difference

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
between russian and global companies

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,640
there is no difference between

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,800
well

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
what about this

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
right now especially in recent months

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,080
we've seen significant changes in the

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
area of providing services and products

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
in the area of informational security

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
as well or by the way we've been

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
attacked and by the way in order to see

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
what happened i'll have to switch it was

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
the fraud in this ticket sale system

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
this is also related to the

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
transportation system i see that this is

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,120
attack against ticket selling system on

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
the railroad and airport

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
okay we are going to continue

75
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,360
did we see any significant changes on

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,239
the russian mssp market in recent months

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,200
roman can you begin

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
i think they did happen maybe they are

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
not noticeable right now but they're

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
going to be noticed by the end of the

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
year and in the conditions of the

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
current situations

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
we know that a number of vendors have

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
left the company number of service

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
representatives in the area of

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
functional security and clients

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
our clients

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
they have to search

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,959
for some alternative solutions

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,599
this could be a replacement of one

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,640
vendor by another mssp provider domestic

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
ssp provider or in some other cases they

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,280
need to replace on-prem solutions which

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
they've been using from a certain vendor

95
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,840
by some other mssp solutions

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
for the speed of their implementation

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
anton what do you feel about it

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,478
well i have to agree with the colleague

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,918
that due to recent events

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,160
foreign vendors

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
whose soft has been traditionally used

102
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,320
for mssp they left our market and

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
they've released a certain niche

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
so our company which exists in the

105
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
course of last five

106
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
years on the mssp market takes their

107
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,080
places can you evaluate the market size

108
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,160
which would appear

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
which is the market which is accessible

110
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560
for mssp service providers well

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
i would make this assessment by the end

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
of the year but right now i can say that

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,039
demand from the side of mssp partners

114
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
both uh

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
for the procurement of the software to

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,479
provide services and also requests from

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
the side of the potential msp partners

118
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
who want to get connected to our mssp

119
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,199
program and the number of these

120
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
applications has grown and just in

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
recent two months the number of these

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
applications has increased the number

123
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
that we had in last year which means in

124
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
the in two months

125
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
march and april it has exceeded the

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
total number and uh money-wise as well

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
interesting

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,080
and uh what kind of requests are those

129
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,720
well as we've heard previously a market

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
was left by foreign vendors and we have

131
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
to replace their services that been

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
provided by them previously we have to

133
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
search for the software for the

134
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
analogies of this software therefore

135
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
there's a lot of demands which are

136
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
coming to us from mssp partners who

137
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
previously been providing services on

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
the basis of foreign software

139
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
and our software

140
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
from positive technologies is a priority

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
software to companies who wants to get

142
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,680
connected to our mssp program and those

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
who don't want to stop providing their

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,080
services to their clients

145
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
which requests and applications do you

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,319
see when we speak about service

147
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,039
outsourcing

148
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
which types of services you mean

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
well for which services there is the

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
highest demand on the market

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,319
well

152
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
taking consideration current situation

153
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
when we see growing number of attacks

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,639
we

155
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,680
see a lot of services of monitoring and

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
responding to attacks

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
as well

158
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
investigation of the consequences of

159
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
these attacks

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
and of course providing services which

161
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
help them to discover the initial

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
reasons of what was happening then

163
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
divide those attacks into certain

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
elements to see where errors are

165
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,880
happening and how to fix those errors

166
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,039
and how can one restore damaged assets

167
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,440
in the infrastructure

168
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
so for these services demands are

169
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
growing very significantly

170
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
yes speaking about the product

171
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,280
um

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
speaking about products traditional

173
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
demands related with application

174
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,160
firewalls web application protection and

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
we see significant growth of

176
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,639
applications for rcm

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,039
also among three top products and the

178
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,840
basis of which we provide services from

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
our msp products

180
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
this is network discovery

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
the one which is used by expert security

182
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
center to investigate

183
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
incidents of hacker attacks yes

184
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
well

185
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,599
in russia msp market

186
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,840
in my understanding was not so well

187
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
developed

188
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
especially if we compare it with western

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,879
countries

190
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,599
where the service related market is

191
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,280
higher than product related market

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,680
do you see right now any radical changes

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
of this trend in the direction that

194
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
clients are ready to work

195
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
following the mssp model

196
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
anton can you be the first one

197
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,159
before these events in february we could

198
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,680
see the growth of attractiveness of mssp

199
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
services for the clients and it was

200
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,399
organic growth insignificant yes but

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,959
after these events everybody knows that

202
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,839
we had problems with hardware delivery

203
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,920
in russia hardware supply and many

204
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,320
clients have faced situation not only

205
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,839
with the lack of qualified specialists

206
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,320
but also with the lack of hardware and

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200
as it was noticed uh previously it's

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
hardware software

209
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
and services no problems with a software

210
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
but we do have problems with employees

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,839
and right now we have problems with the

212
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
hardware so msp partner which has a lot

213
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,279
of hardware becomes the most attractive

214
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
one and their services become attractive

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,160
for their clients

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
how can you comment

217
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
on this

218
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,959
is there any bright trends of demand

219
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
from ssp services because there's a lot

220
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
of models for example the model uh

221
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,000
common for russia when the client does

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,519
everything properly there's an

223
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
outsourcing model

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,800
in the clouds and there's a lot of other

225
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
models

226
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,279
and for some reason mssp has not been

227
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
moving this direction

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
well i would like to say that

229
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
i think we had the situation before

230
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,839
prior to

231
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,160
2020 when the mssp market was very

232
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,480
slowly developing organically

233
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
yet 2020 has corrected the situation

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,480
when the corona has happened and when

235
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,279
the processes in companies started

236
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,399
changing

237
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,920
then due to those changes which were

238
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
required we could see an immediate

239
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
demand

240
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
for such changes especially in

241
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,519
informational security area and the fast

242
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
response could be discovered with the

243
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,040
help of mssp companies but my apologies

244
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
you said back then in those cavy days

245
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
the demand started growing

246
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
but how significantly in percentage

247
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
can you tell me

248
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
well different experts they give

249
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
different numbers

250
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
well speaking about the revenue your

251
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
company receives

252
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
i would say that from the point of view

253
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
of mssp

254
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,120
it was uh from 30 to 50 percent

255
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
when the carved have started and it was

256
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,519
the first

257
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,560
step

258
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
when we could see significant changes in

259
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,439
the growth of mssb

260
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
then we could see the development in

261
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,600
other case in other directions

262
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,279
since february situation have changed

263
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
even more and the second point of growth

264
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,480
when mssp services became even more

265
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
demanded

266
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,359
and we had a situation

267
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,639
that in a short period of time

268
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
we had to realize the system of security

269
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,639
provision due to shrinking capabilities

270
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,880
and at the same time

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,800
we have seen more and more attacks

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,279
against different companies

273
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,760
can you speak about russian market how

274
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,279
does it work do we have high level

275
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,959
competition on the mssp market

276
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
right now we are getting ready to high

277
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,800
level of this competition because uh the

278
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
i.t security market in russia to my

279
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
point of view will grow significantly at

280
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,959
the end of this year including mssp

281
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,000
market

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
but we are ready at the account of the

283
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,040
fact that we include into our msp

284
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,880
program our new products and solutions

285
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
do have a lot of mssp players in the

286
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,599
market who provide these services

287
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,200
can you list anybody who can provide

288
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
these services

289
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
who are the clients who receive these

290
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,480
mssp services well these services are

291
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,000
provided by mssp provider the

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,639
organization

293
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,440
which procures these software from us

294
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
and provides services on the basis of it

295
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
i don't think that it's really different

296
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
from how it happens in the west for the

297
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
client

298
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
which consumes mssp services while

299
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
speaking in the language of

300
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
subscriptions they purchase subscription

301
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
not for our software but they pro

302
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,760
purchase a subscription to mssp provider

303
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,639
software so this is the main difference

304
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,760
of uh on-prem sales

305
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
from classical outsourcing

306
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
mssp outsourcing it's a totally

307
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
different thing and your expectations

308
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,560
upon the results of this year

309
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,399
the volume of sales that you are

310
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,680
responsible for in positive technologies

311
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
will you be able to show growth compared

312
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,839
to the previous period yes i would like

313
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
to show significant

314
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
significant growth very significant

315
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
growth okay roman what are your

316
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
ambitions upon the results of this year

317
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,760
yeah we also have big ambitions

318
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
we see higher demand from the side of

319
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,839
our partners

320
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,040
and we see that from the point of view

321
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,680
of demand for providing our mssp

322
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,480
services the demand has already grown

323
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
significantly and we expect that it's

324
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
going to continue

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
growing and a financial result at the

326
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,399
end of the year will grow and we see the

327
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,199
number of players on this market is also

328
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,440
growing and we create a number of

329
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,639
partnerships here as well

330
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,600
what stops clients from working with

331
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
mssp providers what are the main

332
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
stumbling blocks

333
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
uh

334
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,040
there were certain doubts from the side

335
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,240
of the client and lack of trust to

336
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,639
service providers

337
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
because you have to transfer part of

338
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,680
your infrastructure and your information

339
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,480
and

340
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
join it with the infrastructure of this

341
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,959
third party company and the question of

342
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
trust is a very important

343
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,959
question

344
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
also it is very important due to the

345
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
fact that well on the west there is a

346
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
trend

347
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,140
that

348
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,440
[Music]

349
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
due to

350
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
significant growth of those mssp

351
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,600
providers and their use while the vector

352
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
of attacks have also changed and

353
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
criminals and proctors are trying to

354
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
attack mssp providers

355
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
in order to

356
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
compromise their clients

357
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
so mssp providers should take care of

358
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,079
their own security and by this increase

359
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
trust to them

360
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,680
and things that we observe and these are

361
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
really interesting observations since

362
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
the end of the february of this year

363
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,639
due to well-known events

364
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,000
policies

365
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,519
were changed

366
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
and the companies started toughening the

367
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
security situations

368
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
and the services from the point of view

369
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,279
of internal tougher policies

370
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
this became a stumbling block and for

371
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
some companies it became it even

372
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
impossible to go to mssp provider

373
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,480
because of this

374
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
do you have to convince provider that

375
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,040
they have to work with mssp model

376
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,199
no i don't i don't but i would like to

377
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,399
add to previously said

378
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,800
what else can stop the client

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
in selecting mssp services first of all

380
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
this is very attractive that the client

381
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,720
receives turnkey software hardware

382
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,279
services they don't need to spend money

383
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
for highly qualified personnel but on

384
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
the other side mssp services for the

385
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,280
client

386
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
they have certain disadvantage

387
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,679
disadvantages that mssp service in the

388
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,480
accounting it's an opex

389
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,079
and when you purchase software and you

390
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,240
put it in your balance it's a capital

391
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,679
expenditure

392
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
so it's the question of budgeting for

393
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
example if declined for the next year's

394
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,200
budget his budget was not approved

395
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
and he will not be able to extend the

396
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
software that was purchased

397
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
in their balance as a capex he will have

398
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,400
some money left

399
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,720
but if the budget will not be extended

400
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
and he was purchasing mssp services to

401
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,240
opex he will stay with nothing he is not

402
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
going to to have software and hardware

403
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,760
because everything is going to be on the

404
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
side of mssp provider

405
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
is it a threat

406
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
to mssp budgets not being continued next

407
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
year

408
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,799
the budget distribution so right now the

409
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,080
client puts it into operational budget

410
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
opex

411
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
and they might under

412
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
receive this operational budget next

413
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
year and he's not going to get services

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,919
that they got to use

415
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,840
uh in the previous years do we see

416
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,440
dangers like that

417
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
when they define the budget they don't

418
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
say that this is msp service they say

419
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,320
that

420
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
we need this money

421
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,880
to realize certain security mechanisms

422
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
or certain security mechanisms in the

423
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
infrastructure

424
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,120
so people who are decision makers in

425
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
budgeting

426
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
they don't look whether it's opex or

427
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,559
capex these are costs these are money

428
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,840
will it threaten mssp i think these are

429
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,559
not related things and the final thing

430
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,720
that i might have to you about

431
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
perspectives of development in the

432
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,640
nearest year and a half

433
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,480
which products and services are

434
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,520
most demanded mssp provision what do you

435
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,160
expect

436
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,080
well protection of web applications

437
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
monitoring on the basis of cm

438
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,360
investigation of incidents with the help

439
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,320
of our node i think that demand is going

440
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,399
to grow for mobility management

441
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,120
with the help of our vm products

442
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
i'm thinking how can it be done for the

443
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
partners clients and for us

444
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,039
analysis

445
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,400
searching vulnerabilities in the

446
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
infrastructure and providing reports to

447
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
the clients

448
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
so you need to determine what are the

449
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,840
holes in your infrastructure

450
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
is

451
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
and the second demand is monitoring of

452
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,559
those incidents

453
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,640
which currently are happening in your

454
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,280
infrastructure what can be done with the

455
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
event management and security incidents

456
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
so what's happening here and number

457
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,080
three in case if the hacker attack

458
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
happens it is very important to

459
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
understand what happened and investigate

460
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
this incident and this is demand to

461
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,520
investigate these incidents

462
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,690
okay

463
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,720
[Music]

464
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
do you see certain trends in the next

465
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,039
year year and a half

466
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
well everything depends on the level of

467
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
maturity of the company

468
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,880
which looks at the possibility of mssp

469
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,159
on a certain level of maturity

470
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
also topics related with providing

471
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
security infrastructure monitoring

472
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
scanning

473
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,039
which already have these processes which

474
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,799
have already implemented those processes

475
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,080
in the company

476
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
they will look in a direction of

477
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,400
improvement of the quality of the

478
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,120
services and

479
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,719
classical awareness

480
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,200
maybe they will use

481
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,559
some

482
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,559
test approaches which become more and

483
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,400
more viable well i would like to wish

484
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
you success

485
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,360
markets of mssp which are widely fast

486
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
developing in russia it is important to

487
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,280
have wide portfolio

488
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,039
in order to provide more products and

489
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,039
services to providers on the basis of

490
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,400
what vendor provides to them

491
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
you have not given us specific growth

492
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,520
numbers but you've told us significant

493
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,760
growth well i remember these words

494
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,799
so

495
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,320
take these new opportunities and use

496
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,400
them for your benefits thank you thank

497
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
you very much
