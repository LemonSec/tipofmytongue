1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,080
hi alexi

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
so we're visited by alexander expert

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,759
security center ahead in positive

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,120
technologies and we're going to speak uh

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,360
about cyber exercise

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
and we do the cyber exercise on the

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
basis of positive infrastructure so what

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,560
is the cyber exercise and why do we need

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,439
it

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,119
well first of all i will give you

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,800
certain clearance we don't do it on the

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,439
basis of infrastructure but on

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
real base

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
that we work with an infrastructure that

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,880
you work with every day in real networks

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,520
so we do it in our real networking real

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
network that's how this exercise is

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
being done the main objective of this

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,039
cyber exercise is to check how our

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
informational security system works the

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,360
one that we built in our company because

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,760
according to our opinion during real

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
cyber exercise you will be able to see

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
how different procedures are operated

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
inside of our company we have defined an

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,320
accessible

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
events that we're afraid of and which to

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
our company can lead to maximal damage

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
theft of money injection of code in into

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
our products supply chain

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
you speak about uh vulnerable

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
even backdoor

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
if the backdrop will be injected and

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
then will be delivered to our clients

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
it's going to be a big damage an example

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,159
of such attack attacks against the solar

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,000
chain were happening like solar winds

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
and in the last four years were saying

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
that supply chain attacks is a trend

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
and from year to year they become more

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
and more obvious and we'll see more such

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,320
attacks

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,280
then set off confidential information

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
from our infrastructure from our network

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
it's an unallowable event that we have

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
defined for ourselves and the main

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,840
objective of the informational security

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,960
department sock i.t department is to do

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
it in such a way so that no matter what

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
taxes these unallowable events would not

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
be realized inside of our infrastructure

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
we have certain monitoring we have

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
conducted hardening

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,399
according to our internal developed

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,199
compliances how our informational system

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,200
should look like

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,920
we have implemented a reaction approved

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,760
it together with our i.t department

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,280
and we invite different teams to attack

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
our infrastructure emulate external

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
thrusters internal fraudsters

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,760
and see how our security system fights

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
against it aren't you afraid to

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
invite external pen testers well this is

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
the infrastructure i come in the morning

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
i take my copy i open my laptop and i

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
start reading certain emails and then

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,640
you receive phishing letter from some

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
external attack team

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,959
in the beginning

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
we did have something like this well

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
different teams they use different

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
penetration tactics and techniques and

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,200
in course of last year we've been

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
looking at six different teams

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,879
which have been attacking positive

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,319
infrastructure there were different

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
teams

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
they have their own footprints

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,280
they specialize in different things so

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
we've been inviting our guys our highly

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,480
qualified teams of pen testers and

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,120
hackers which also been attacking us and

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
then we've been looking at how the

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,280
infrastructure behaves inside

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
infrastructure with our products how our

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
regulations work and how the security

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
system was developed from our side and

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
also inviting just

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,959
teams from outside with different

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
approaches and i can definitely tell you

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
that we can clearly see that different

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,239
hacker teams they attack differently and

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
it makes sense

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,120
we should see the roots of everything

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
because the team which is involved in

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
consulting operations on the market they

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
are targeted for the goals for success

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
and they have one type of tactics

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
another team which works more in a red

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
team

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,480
mode

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
who works in-house or they provide a red

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
team services uh

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
not the black box method but they have a

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
certain knowledge of infrastructure they

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,439
understand that they're gonna be cut

108
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
that somebody will be

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
rejecting them

110
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,120
and there is going to be rejection it

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
means they need to simulate activities

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,919
of real hunger

113
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,160
not just can you give us the passwords

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
and we're going to do everything

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
ourselves right right they are behaving

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,280
more accurately and more durational with

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
time

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,160
more lengthy well from our point of view

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,720
the minimal allowable time for real

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
cyber exercise not less than three

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
months three months yes because

122
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
if you reduce it to one month or

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
month and a half the attackers it's

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,479
gonna be difficult for attackers

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,479
especially if they work in the black box

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,479
mode they have to understand the

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,240
infrastructure

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
what do you mean by black box well black

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
box when they know only the external

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
connection and in the result of the

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
ascend they have discovered what belongs

132
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
to the company and then they attack it

133
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,280
so they attack blindly without knowing

134
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,638
any internal resources yes

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
as a third-party person on the side of

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
the criminal

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
so

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
on the stage of the investigation inside

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
of the infrastructure it takes a lot of

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
time

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,000
especially if this team makes uh

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
does all of it hiding and obfuscating

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,160
their actions

144
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
you can give them hints you can tell

145
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
them which segments exist in the

146
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,479
infrastructure

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,320
how they are divided in order to speed

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
up their actions

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
but it's not so interesting

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
so three months

151
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,720
this is the most optimal time

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
also it is important to look at target

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,440
setting because we went through several

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
iterations during this exercise and

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
target setting has been formed

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
differently

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
you can formulate the impossible event

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
as the money theft and then

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
different interpretations begin is it

160
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
possible to steal money maybe it's not

161
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,479
possible to steal the money and they get

162
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
access to one of the accounting

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,080
computers they open the console make a

164
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,680
screenshot and they said well whoever

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,919
entered 1c accounting we can steal your

166
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,880
money after this

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
the financial department gets in instead

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
says okay after the accounting well this

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,080
system that system and then dbo so

170
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
internal processes which regulate that

171
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
even if the

172
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
hacker gets access to one c he's not

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
going to be able to do this

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
because the company doesn't just have

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
technical limitations but also certain

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
internal procedures and certain business

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
processes and very often the argument is

178
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,759
happens around technical for example you

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
get access to some critically important

180
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
system

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
we call them key systems those systems

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
which have a key influence against

183
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,759
different business processes however

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
there is no guarantee that you can

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
violate this business process and

186
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
transfer money for example so at the

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,880
current moment of time during this cyber

188
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
exercise we have specific goals

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
we tell them okay dear hackers who

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
attack us you have an objective to

191
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
transfer money from our account to

192
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,199
another account so in positive they can

193
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,160
take big

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
amount and transfer it to a certain

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
amount well we don't say big amount

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,720
but the fact of money transfer is

197
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
important to us to a specific account

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,199
so we would like to check not only the

199
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
technical limitations that we have

200
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,039
inside of our infrastructure not only

201
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,120
the technical means of protection of the

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
uh information sock and i.t activities

203
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,800
but also would like to check the

204
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,599
propriety of organizational

205
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,160
controllers which are built within the

206
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
business processes it's interesting

207
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,319
because when we've been discussing those

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
business risks

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
owners of those business processes

210
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
where these uh inadmissible events have

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
landed they are getting involved in it

212
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
and in most of the cases they know where

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
you can make a trick

214
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
okay let's speak about it you've been

215
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
listing a lot of different risks

216
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,160
financial risks technological risks and

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,639
maybe some other risk who are those

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
people you approach to formulate those

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
risks

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
let me begin with an example of my

221
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,440
management company our company uh the

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
risks are being formed by top management

223
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,679
ceo of the company other top managers

224
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
[Music]

225
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,519
and we have been doing it in iterational

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,760
matter we have a big list and a number

227
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
of those inadmissible events we have

228
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
approximately 30 of them then we started

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
discussing them and started looking at

230
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
different

231
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
options different scenarios of what is

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
going to happen if this will happen or

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
that will happen and in result of these

234
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
discussions we have understood that we

235
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
have a limited number of specific uh

236
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,080
four inadmissible events

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
can bring a great damage to the company

238
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,519
and looking at the international

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,440
experience are those incidents and

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
statistics of those incidents that we've

241
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
seen in infrastructure of other

242
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
companies and globally

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
basically these four inadmissible events

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
are applicable for most of the companies

245
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
so many companies are afraid when their

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
money are going to be stolen for example

247
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
in the accounts of the company they have

248
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
a lot of money it's inadmissible event

249
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
for them

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
and from my point of view all the

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
developers they have to seriously treat

252
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
supply chain attacks there was a lot of

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
public situations

254
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
can you disclose it how this might

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,279
happen in our situation well supply

256
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
chain when the criminal injects a

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
certain code maybe back door

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
vulnerability or anything else

259
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,519
then

260
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,079
it gets into the assembly and then

261
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,880
distributed amongst our clients so the

262
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
criminal

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
with the help of our distributions of

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
this vendor gets into their

265
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
infrastructure and well i've been

266
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,720
speaking about solar wind supply chain

267
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
this is the mass product so in our

268
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
portfolio we have more than 10 products

269
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
like this

270
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
and some of them have big big

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
distribution among our clients

272
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,160
among

273
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
big business clients in russia so to us

274
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
this is inadmissible event and

275
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
practically when we do incident

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
investigation the first time supply

277
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
chain we've seen four years ago when the

278
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
vendor was compromised and through the

279
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
vendor they've entered to certain big

280
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,240
organizations

281
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
it's a pain it's a problem and from my

282
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
point of view each vendor should take

283
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
care of this and responsibly approach

284
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
the process of development look at how

285
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
does it work what is what are the

286
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,560
results which distribution which stages

287
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,360
does it go through how easy is it to

288
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,680
change something in this distribution

289
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,920
software and another important thing is

290
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
that most of the people approach it

291
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
formally they say okay we have a

292
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
certified process we have checked it the

293
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
papers have been filled and submitted

294
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
that's all right but in real life

295
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,279
after analyzing this inadmissible event

296
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
we understand that there's a lot of

297
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,399
attack vectors through which supply

298
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
chain attack can be realized

299
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
i can speak even about those vectors

300
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,839
which are related to open source

301
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
products it's not a secret from anyone

302
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,600
big corporate developments this or other

303
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
way are using open source components

304
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,839
some libraries open source components

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,760
which are available to wide audiences

306
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,279
and you can integrate your product

307
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,200
within them so you can integrate your

308
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
product and it's very important to check

309
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
the version where where did it come from

310
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
maybe it doesn't have a back door or

311
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
injection in this component that you

312
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,480
receive maybe it has certain

313
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,550
vulnerabilities

314
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,719
[Music]

315
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
last year and this year there was a lot

316
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
of uh uh

317
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,560
vulnerabilities that were printed in the

318
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,279
news lock for g and other ones you speak

319
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
there they've been popular yes these are

320
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,839
very popular libraries and big number of

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
products are used by these libraries

322
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
in their uh code base

323
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
okay speaking about biggest enterprise

324
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
companies

325
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,200
90

326
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,839
of them they did have those libraries

327
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
and we've been analyzing our products as

328
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
well

329
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,200
and inside of our products if i'm not

330
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,079
mistaken in four of them this library

331
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,040
has been used so we've been looking and

332
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
it's been used on many occasions yes yes

333
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
it was so we've been analyzing how this

334
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,399
vector is important for our products

335
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,440
about how the version complies and then

336
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,839
we've been producing patches which been

337
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,560
closing this vulnerability when it was

338
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,639
discovered

339
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
and this is very important because in

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
the case of log4g it became very well

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
known and everybody started researching

342
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,440
this vector however taking in

343
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
consideration the current situation in

344
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
the area of informational security it

345
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
doesn't give you the guarantee that

346
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
anybody is not going to put it into a

347
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,000
certain open source uh uh functionality

348
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
and there were some examples of it

349
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
of this library yes there was a lot of

350
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
examples when in open libraries they've

351
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,680
been injecting certain code which have

352
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
been showing certain windows with

353
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,920
certain messages or the functioning has

354
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,079
been stopped on the territory of russian

355
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,839
federation and this is a very important

356
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,680
story and

357
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
we should work on this

358
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
on the basis of a positive

359
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
infrastructure

360
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,720
how many teams do we have in this cyber

361
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
exercise well

362
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,760
i'm i've lost the count

363
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
and for the first time i feel really

364
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
worried it's very

365
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,839
interesting well the first time it was

366
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,160
back then we have approached it very

367
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
cognitively well in our company we've

368
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,399
been conducting a lot of pen tests we've

369
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,959
been attracting our hacker team as well

370
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,560
at a certain moment of time we have

371
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,440
attracted them so that they would work

372
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,079
in a concept of inadmissible events to

373
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,480
demonstrate what they're able to do

374
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,720
and it was uh well right now 22. it

375
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
wasn't back in 2020 yeah it was back in

376
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
2020 then we looked at the result

377
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,959
and we have been able to formulate those

378
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,560
inadmissible events well before you've

379
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,839
been speaking about those inadmissible

380
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,959
events

381
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,440
you've looked at results and

382
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
how

383
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
good was it considering that we're a

384
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
technological company considering that

385
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,639
these were the first cyber exercises of

386
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,360
this kind well cyber exercises they have

387
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
different functioning modes in our first

388
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,600
cyber exercise we've been trying to

389
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
prove that inadmissible events are

390
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,600
possible inside of our infrastructure

391
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
and that's why uh

392
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
ib and salk infrastructure they have not

393
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,360
been fighting with each other they were

394
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
able to get there

395
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,880
and they were able to show us the

396
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,639
technical capabilities that they have

397
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,600
received access to key systems

398
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
like one c for example for example i've

399
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
reached this this and this node and if

400
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,240
i'll press the button something's going

401
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,040
to happen yes most likely inadmissible

402
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,320
event might happen after this we started

403
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,279
changing the format of cyber exercise

404
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
first of all we started changing the

405
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,000
response in the infrastructure

406
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
response is one of the most important

407
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,920
points it's impossible to build response

408
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,720
in a company which would be successful

409
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
and would respond to any hacker without

410
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
its own processes

411
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
well i was asked not to touch it and i'm

412
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,560
not touching it

413
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,000
but right now you

414
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
yeah you send the ticket to the it and

415
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
it it says well three days for blocking

416
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,839
and then you see only because of these

417
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,680
three days they penetrated to your own

418
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,079
infrastructure

419
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
so we built respawns we've been

420
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,160
developing plans with atn we've been

421
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,560
building control points so that we would

422
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,240
see the chain of how hackers penetrate

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,720
through the infrastructure

424
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,040
then cyber exercise that we did have we

425
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
have invited one team

426
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,440
excellent it we really worried about it

427
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,920
because this external team was really a

428
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,079
strong one

429
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
we gave them a list of inadmissible

430
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
events and we asked them to realize them

431
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
we've been checking them in two modes in

432
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,680
a mode of external uh criminal

433
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
and they were able to show realization

434
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
of one inadmissible event

435
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
and then

436
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,600
so they were able to do something yeah

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
then we let them inside of our

438
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
infrastructure and we wanted to see how

439
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
they will behave as internal fraudster

440
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
but always

441
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,439
i'm saying always that external and

442
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
internal criminals they are given by one

443
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,280
step one phishing letter one account uh

444
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,640
one push

445
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,359
which you have pushed on uh dual factor

446
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,160
authorization

447
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,520
and we have switched off the response

448
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,599
mode because we wanted to see how they

449
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,199
were able how they're going to be able

450
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,599
to do it so you've been watching without

451
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,559
responding yes we wanted to

452
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,799
investigate the fullness of coverage

453
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,720
about infrastructure because we wanted

454
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
to see the whole chain how long is this

455
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
chain and what's going to be the

456
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
visibility of this chain because

457
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,200
we also have decided uh to look at very

458
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,160
important parameter

459
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,720
how much the heck how much time the

460
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
hacker will need to realize this an

461
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
admissible event because it directly

462
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
influences the speed of response

463
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
in the same process we've been tuning

464
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,440
our

465
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
we've been tuning our products our new

466
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,400
expertise back for cm for nom for off

467
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
and we've been working with r d

468
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
department in this direction so you've

469
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
understood how the chain works you've

470
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
understood to which nodes they enter

471
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,039
where the product wasn't seen where the

472
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,360
process is incomplete yes you're right

473
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,440
roughly speaking this were the second

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,160
and first exercise then we've been

475
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,840
inviting to other teams

476
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
and in the autumn of the last year we

477
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,480
have invited three teams and right now

478
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
this year

479
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,320
in the beginning well approximately one

480
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,960
month ago we have invited our people

481
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,240
to check once again our positive

482
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
infrastructure we switched off the

483
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,240
response mode and the objective of this

484
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
sock is to collect kill chains to look

485
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
at the tactics and strategies and we've

486
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,240
changed some things

487
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,679
because in the infrastructure of our

488
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,480
company we have you too

489
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
our meta product

490
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
that we started producing from the last

491
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,640
year and during those cyber exercise

492
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,080
that we've started one month ago

493
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
we are checking what you too and how

494
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
does it see the movement of hackers

495
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
inside of the infrastructure and how

496
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,840
this chain which is being seen by o2

497
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
with one operator and together with rng

498
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,440
team how does it comply to the chain

499
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
that is being seen by sock

500
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,559
so

501
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,520
we match these stories and we try to

502
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
understand

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
where sock was faster where youtube was

504
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
faster so your main objective is not

505
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,919
just to understand how the hacker

506
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
behaves to build your own processes and

507
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
to improve the product but also you have

508
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,720
to teach you too so that it would learn

509
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,320
to work at least not works as the expert

510
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,919
team yes we want to make you too

511
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,160
to work faster and with a better quality

512
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
than our sock because we clearly

513
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
understand the team that we have in soc

514
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
and we have highly

515
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,880
high specialists in forensics head

516
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
hunting

517
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
uh first line second line monitoring

518
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
analytics and we have limited number of

519
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
those people

520
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
and we can have like maximum 10 people

521
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
in the market and how many

522
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
you have in this cyber exercise how many

523
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
experts do you have who understands how

524
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
it works in your sock mini miserable

525
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,480
challenge would you decide to minimize

526
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
our human resources and

527
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
we wanted to find that minimum of people

528
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
that will give us proper results so from

529
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,520
the side of the sock

530
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,679
per unit of time we have three people

531
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,240
unshift simultaneously one of these

532
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
three people

533
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
and we have started uh well these are

534
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,159
interns so this one person is an intern

535
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,600
who just came to our company

536
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
this is the first or second dive into

537
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
the info security area and they're just

538
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,120
learning

539
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,240
so they work 24 by seven

540
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
in different time zones they are located

541
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,799
in order so that for everybody is going

542
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,880
to be maximum comfortable to work we

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
have minimized the number of people

544
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
which currently monitor so three people

545
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,159
is enough for the shift work in sock

546
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,120
yeah

547
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
in addition to these uh shift uh salk

548
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
three people uh in the informational

549
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,760
security department we also have the

550
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
sheet from the i.t department it's only

551
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
one person

552
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,559
who follows the operability and who also

553
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,880
checks all the tickets and response

554
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
tickets or the source connection tickets

555
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
or maybe other changes in infrastructure

556
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
would be done correctly then if i'm not

557
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,120
mistaken in 24 by seven mode we have

558
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
another person in this support

559
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,159
department who is involved in support

560
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:02,880
and

561
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,799
operationability of the products because

562
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,640
sock is not involved in

563
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,840
cm engineering and sandboxes for their

564
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,919
operability and for their exploitation

565
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,200
we have another department being

566
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
responsible well it's not light so

567
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,480
you've listed about like five or six

568
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,280
people but in typical security shift

569
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
that's not it that's not it so in this

570
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
shift we have five people also you have

571
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,919
to take into consideration that some

572
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,480
shifts are eight hours long some shifts

573
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
are uh 12 hours long so in order to

574
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,000
close these 24x7 you have to multiply

575
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
these five people by four because some

576
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,640
people get weeks some people go on

577
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
vacation some people get sick so you

578
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
have to multiply it by four so you have

579
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,400
20 people so when you have those 20

580
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
people you have to manage them you have

581
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
the head of the group and according to

582
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,960
our estimation so approximately 25

583
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,600
people and this is the proper number of

584
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
people which is sufficient for the

585
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,159
infrastructure which looks like ours

586
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,120
where we have approximately have up to

587
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,520
10 000 assets

588
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,799
if the number of informational assets is

589
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,640
going to grow if the number of

590
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,559
facilities will grow then the number of

591
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,400
people will also have to be increased

592
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,159
because these number of people will not

593
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,240
be able to cope with this volume and

594
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
point number two to this number of

595
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
people well we've been approaching this

596
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
number quite a while maybe year and a

597
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
half

598
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
in our initial steps we had much more

599
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
people within a shift from our side from

600
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,400
tech support side because during

601
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
real tests we

602
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,880
start understanding that we have to

603
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
automate more or we start understanding

604
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
where we need to have a shorter

605
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
horizontal connections to be built uh

606
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,720
product functionality that has to be

607
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,840
improved or well for example i know r d

608
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,919
people are approaching sock team and

609
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,640
they say which buttons do you press most

610
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,760
often and they say okay every 30 minutes

611
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,159
we press this one two three and then

612
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,559
next release says well instead of these

613
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,400
three buttons you have to press this one

614
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,080
button which will cover these three

615
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,640
processes which speeds up the process so

616
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
we give a big input to the cyber

617
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,159
exercise not only from the point of view

618
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,120
of our own positive security but we also

619
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
introduce

620
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
a real experience and methodology of

621
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,080
exploitation of our products and their

622
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,000
development

623
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
the final question that i have to you

624
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
know for example we are going to conduct

625
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,679
another cyber exercise and we're going

626
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
to convince that the infrastructure is

627
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,240
reliably protected everything has been

628
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
optimized everything is

629
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,760
right and steaming okay then we are

630
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,159
going to start back bounty in the

631
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,880
positive infrastructure after this we

632
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,520
are going to announce the positive back

633
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
bounty for the whole positive

634
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
infrastructure and the cherry and the

635
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,020
cake the ideal result will be

636
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,200
[Music]

637
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,279
every external hacker who is motivated

638
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
by a very expensive bug bounty program

639
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,039
they

640
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,919
not myself will be responding but you

641
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,799
too will be responding and not 25 people

642
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
but four people

643
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
who are going uh 24 by four days

644
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,440
so the automatic response

645
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,159
with proper discovery with proper

646
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,720
response with proper chain discovery

647
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
it's the result that we would like to

648
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,440
achieve and then as a next step we have

649
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
to understand that we're not losing this

650
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
result because we have we see new

651
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,360
vulnerabilities we discover them we

652
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,760
change business processes we

653
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,600
produce new sites new products city

654
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,480
infrastructure is a living and breeding

655
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
uh product and it's not just a result

656
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
that you have achieved no when you get

657
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,279
to this uh paramount well you see the

658
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,679
new mountain and you have to reach

659
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,440
another paramount and in 36 five days a

660
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
year you have to check that you don't

661
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,760
have any problems and that you are able

662
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
to operationally and continuously

663
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
maintain this information security level

664
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,760
and in such a way to be a public example

665
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
that this is achievable that this is

666
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,960
possible

667
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
and

668
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,000
how our products work with all of these

669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
and how is it necessary to build

670
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,279
informational security on the basis of

671
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,559
the inaccessible events concept

672
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,559
thank you inadmissible events which

673
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
might happen in digital infrastructure

674
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,679
of the company and may entail serious

675
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,360
consequences that alexis was speaking

676
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,600
about for every team these events could

677
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
be different

678
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,840
but

679
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
there are a few of them for example this

680
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
is the theft a big amount of money

681
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,919
injection of malicious god uh into the

682
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,919
source code if it's a development

683
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,400
company

684
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
if it's a technological company they

685
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,480
have the skada

686
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
when the sky can be broken which can

687
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,279
damage the industry significantly and

688
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,520
even sometimes lead to human casualties

689
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,159
so this cyber exercise is a necessary

690
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,400
tool to check how the company is

691
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
sustainable uh to respond to such

692
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
inadmissive events and interesting

693
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,320
experience that you have it's going to

694
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,559
be interesting when this cyber exercise

695
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,159
will be completed and we're going to

696
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,320
tell to the audience

697
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,080
which result did we achieve and another

698
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,600
important thing that you've told us is

699
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,120
you too because we've been announcing

700
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,159
you two some time ago and uh

701
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,720
it's very interesting to follow how it's

702
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
developing

703
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
and right now product is on the stage

704
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,159
when

705
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,960
expert team inside of the infrastructure

706
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,799
is learning to detect hacker attacks

707
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,399
and therefore

708
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,279
we

709
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,080
do

710
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
automated protection thank you liosha

711
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,880
thank you
