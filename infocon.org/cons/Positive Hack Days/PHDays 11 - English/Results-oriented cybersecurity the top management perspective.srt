1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
it is the new terminology that recently

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,719
emerged in the market but it helps us

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,320
understand better the goals of cyber

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,080
security now let's

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,039
talk to alexander bill b who is ceo of

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,880
rosatom digital solutions about the

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,279
goals and objectives of results oriented

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
cyber security

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,640
well it's a pleasure to be here thank

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
you very much for the introduction and

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
for the invite it's my first time here

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,800
and very often you get to hear

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
especially in hr management or hr

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
consultancy i

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,640
tend to

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,520
speak about engagement or involvement

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
you can sell immediately that everyone

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,640
here is completely engaged everyone here

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,399
the integrators the vendors the

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,199
participants and i envy you in a good

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,559
way because um in my company i would

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,800
love to see the same level of engagement

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,399
of my employees

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,760
well thank you very much for your kind

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
words you know that this is our 11th

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,560
forum and we've been around for a while

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
and our objective is to

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
showcase

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
cyber security to

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
demonstrate which incidents a real

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
statement may face or to explain who

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
hackers and defenders are so it's uh

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
it means very practical they are hacking

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
they are considering scenarios but at

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,720
the same time

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,040
we see our mission in education exactly

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000
exactly and also uh engagement soap

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
management and we will talk about top

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
management there all top management also

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
needs to be engaged

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,119
and

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,960
it needs to be educated about what

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
information security is a result

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,240
oriented

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
efficient uh

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,960
uh

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
information security for me

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,960
means a mechanism clear mechanism uh to

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,439
protect your business from undesired

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,479
events especially under the current

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,040
circumstances the video hosting that uh

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,920
i mean people have been talking about uh

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
since last week this is such a huge

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
reputation risk and today it's reaching

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
a level when every top manager

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
not should should not just follow a

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,800
script that yeah we've got a script and

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
i'm following the script of information

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
security but now as a top manager i need

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,959
to be engaged myself i need to

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,560
understand

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,920
uh what

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
my innocence are what my unacceptable

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,200
events are what for me a business unit

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,840
is what does it mean and based on that

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
understanding cyber security should be

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
built engagement of the punishment is

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
key it has a digital transformation it

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,599
starts also with the top management if

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
you don't leave the story then it's very

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
difficult to

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
attract

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
others uh to the same narrative it's

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
very difficult to engage others and

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,840
building a safe and reliable enterprise

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
do you understand it correctly that the

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
digital transformation has affected

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
almost every single company and business

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,120
here

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,920
should also be focusing on results it

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
should also be result our e and t

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
well totally uh digital transformation

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,400
what does it mean in essence we all

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
understand

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
that any

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,560
digital footprint or any digital trace

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,599
leads to

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
a risk of

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
my abuse is

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,680
in my pocket and you can rob me off the

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,799
wallet

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
you can take it from me physically by

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
upon physical force but in the digital

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,799
world i understand that i can lose

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
access to resources that i'm using uh

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
through other mechanisms so it's

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
integral integral part of your digital

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,920
planning whether you are planning

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,319
engineering software or industrial

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
software you must always understand how

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,920
you would be controlling

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,640
the

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
cyber security it's

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,519
preventing various risks what is the

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
role of cyber security in the digital

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
transformation and in uh making the

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
unacceptable impossible

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
yeah must

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,519
know i i say that the group of digital

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
transformation well basically

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
there are many books uh

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
written

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,360
tony sudden thomas several they all

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
wrote good books consultants heaps of

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
consultants come and tell you uh hey let

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
us analyze your current model uh give

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
you a picture of your target model and

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
you can also get roma's agile scrum or

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
waterfall or some other methodology that

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
you can follow to reach your targets

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
for me digital transformation

122
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
and it's it's not

123
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,400
it's not a revolutionary

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,359
vision really but

125
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
top management soft management always

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
thinks about p l

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
if i do this what will be the effects

128
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,919
that at the end of the year i can tell

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,120
my shareholder here is that was our plan

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,880
and uh

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,800
i outperformed it

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
the real problem is home security is

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
very difficult to

134
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,440
quantify to monetize

135
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,479
we know it we cooperate with you often

136
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
and every time when we uh reach the

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
point in our discussion where we are

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
saying that if i invest one ruble how

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
big the payback will be well usually

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
it's zero you can't make money with

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
cyber security but you can lose a lot of

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
money with cyber security yeah cyber

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
security can make tomorrow better than

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
today i don't know statistics and it's

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
very difficult to sell actually i don't

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
know statistics let's talk about a car

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
you buy a new expensive car or not very

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,400
expensive car really how many people

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
ensure

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,240
the car completely how many people would

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
buy a complete spicy insurance you can

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
pay 5 million robots for the car but are

153
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
you willing to risk the car you can

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,319
insure it you can invest the money where

155
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,240
you can put the car in a garage and it

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
will stay there for for forever but you

157
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
have already paid for third-party

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
liability insurance and i think that top

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
management often thinks in the similar

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
way they come and say why do i need to

161
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
invest into heavy and complex products a

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
cyber security

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
software hardware installation pay for

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,359
installation as well

165
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,479
so it's for me it's a matter of changing

166
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,520
the culture for me as cyber security is

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
an integral part of the digital

168
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,960
transformation and digital

169
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
infrastructure but

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
i'd start

171
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
with the key factors that impact the p

172
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,560
and l i wanted to go to

173
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
use another example steel and mining in

174
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
metallurgy the most expensive part of

175
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
the production process is the blast

176
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
furnace and

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
this is the most labor intensive the

178
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,720
most technology intensive and the cost

179
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,919
intensive

180
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,880
part

181
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,840
if you optimize the operation of a blast

182
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
furnace by

183
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
half a percent one percent the business

184
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,960
will feel an immediate effect and using

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
these success stories you need to

186
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
persuade the top management that is

187
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,919
worth investing into

188
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,639
all kinds of digital optimizations

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,479
including digital or information

190
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
security

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
so what's the role of information

192
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
security

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,280
in this

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,000
narrative

195
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
it's an integral part of digital

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
transformation i don't know

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,400
when you

198
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,599
when you

199
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,879
uh

200
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
when you look at digital transformation

201
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
usually you would see several blocks in

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,919
there like six seven and one of these

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,520
blocks will be uh cyber security is uh a

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
mandatory part

205
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
and what about unacceptable no i mean

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
cyber security uh results-oriented cyber

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,319
security maybe i'm uh already uh you're

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
thinking you know ahead of your

209
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
questions but i'm no longer thinking in

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
terms of classical subsecurity that we

211
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
discussed a year ago two years ago i'm

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
thinking about cyber security 2.0

213
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,639
results are in subsecurity corporate

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,680
culture must be changed and the top

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
management must be made aware

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,680
of the results uh results

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,479
uh information security another example

218
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,400
for the listeners

219
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
many people especially top management

220
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
can say what is esg right everyone knows

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
what hge is and every top manager can

222
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
give their explanation of what is you if

223
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
you ask industry 4-0

224
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
anyone will be able to give the

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
definition of ms340 but what about

226
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,680
cybersecurity you can do this kind of a

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
poll you can go to top management in any

228
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
company and

229
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
ask them what is security 2.0 no one

230
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
will be able to give an answer and it's

231
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
normal i think uh it's natural but it

232
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
must be changed

233
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,920
thank you very much alexander

234
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
results-oriented subsecurity esg i mean

235
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,320
people understand what it means industry

236
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
for 4.0 they understand what it means

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,800
but cyber security

238
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
the results uh

239
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,519
oriented cyber security is when cyber

240
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
security is an integral part an

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,000
inalienable part of

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
the digital transformation

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
and

244
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,279
prevents unacceptable events from

245
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,880
happening

246
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
ensuring the well-being

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,080
of

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,839
the

249
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,360
business thank you alexander alexander

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,680
