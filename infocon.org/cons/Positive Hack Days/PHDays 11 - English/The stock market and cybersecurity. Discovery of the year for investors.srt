hello

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,760
it's unusual for you to come to cyber

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,440
range

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,879
and speak about cyber security

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
when you are related to the investment

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
segment however in recent days cyber

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,199
security is a very interesting object

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,159
for investors and this is very important

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,119
to open this segment for a wide audience

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,200
of those who can be interested in this

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
let's begin with this market in these

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,880
new realities whatever you see happen

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,080
let's begin with you alexi

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,520
well first of all

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
the exchange market i would uh divide

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,759
into prior to 24 of february and after

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,720
if prior to 24th of february it was

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
classical

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,920
growing

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
equity market worthy

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,520
everything was done by institutional

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
investors in those recent transactions

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
on share placements which were happening

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
usually 50 or more percent of demand was

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,079
coming to foreign investors

41
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,799
and also largest public companies

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,560
shareholders and largest national

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,479
shareholders were institutional

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,960
investors the situation right now have

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
changed significantly

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
first of all if we're going to speak

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
about

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,560
activities on the stock exchange

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
uh no activities of foreign investors

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
are obvious russian institutionals are

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,879
also

52
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,400
so the main weather in the market is

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
made by physical entities

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
who until recently we're making 30 to 40

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,319
right now more than 50 percent of

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,959
turnover and demand on the for public

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,599
shares are coming from physical entities

58
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
more than 50 of the turnover

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
yes on average uh stock exchange

60
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
statistics

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
i think that in the future along the

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
situation will be stabilizing the

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,319
economy we see a lot of new placements

64
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,200
new

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
names and perhaps the main difference

66
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
from what was happening before when

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
companies were looking at the demand

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
from the side of international investors

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,959
institutional ones i think

70
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
the new one will be done and developed

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
by the physical investors first of all

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,760
the depth of demand

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
i believe that the average size of new

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
transactions will be much lower than

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,799
prior to february when we have seen

76
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
ipo of 400 500 million dollars right now

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,680
the transaction of 150 million dollars

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
will be a normal transaction it's going

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,360
to be a new reality and the main demand

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
will be 50 60

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
will come from the side of physical

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
entities

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
physical persons

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
developing this conversation i would

85
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,959
like to add that

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
due to the changes on the market due to

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,560
foreign investors have left and only

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
russia investors stayed in the market

89
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
two things are happening we will see the

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
changes in the approach

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,959
to investment strategies and to the

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,200
assessment of the company because

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,079
historically

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,840
there were significant differences in

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,519
preferences a risk appetite from

96
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,639
american investors and russian investors

97
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
and this is the first difference

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
uh to which the sectors will be

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
reassessed and the second thing that i

100
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,479
would like to add to these well the

101
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,120
approach is different on this stage to

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
the investment strategy and i think in

103
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
event in west we see a lot more funds

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
who and people who have invested deep

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
fundamental analysis for their

106
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
investment so this

107
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
is a sign of a better developed

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,199
financial market so right now in new

109
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,560
realities

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
certain time

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,040
will take for rebuilding this system and

112
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
renovating this system

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
which creates possibilities as well

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,680
i would add to these that

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
there was a good period of uncertainty

116
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,479
when markets were frozen

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
and big amount of private investors were

118
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,560
positively looking at these jobs

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,919
that was happening in the market when

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,160
markets have spiked and first trading

121
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
days we have seen that they have

122
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759
supported very well

123
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,840
those uh

124
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,960
that were

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,560
existing in the market it helps this

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,199
diversification

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
by type of investors helps companies

128
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,880
honestly speaking

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
as my colleagues have said there is a

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
movement towards private investors this

131
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
marketing is a little bit different uh

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
they have different objectives

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
they are less

134
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
susceptible to analytics it's important

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
that the company should be well known

136
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
and

137
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
it would it should have

138
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
interesting work with investors that's

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
why those trends that we have seen

140
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,319
recently when there was a big inflow of

141
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,120
private investors from classical banking

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
deposits into the investment

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
it was additionally realized and helped

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
to stabilize our market in addition to

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,440
this these investors perceiving more

146
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,840
positively these new industries and

147
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,319
being more particular

148
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
an example of your company have

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,400
indicated that cyber security is

150
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,319
interesting and it's important to tell

151
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
people about it and justify it and then

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,039
this idea is going to work okay let's

153
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,840
speak about it

154
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
speaking about new industries which are

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
selected by investors

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,880
what attracts them because cyber

157
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,600
security one year ago even six months

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,880
ago nobody knew about this market uh

159
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
there is something unclear not

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
understandable and niche

161
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
marketed but right now we see in our

162
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,319
example as a market uh company everyday

163
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,960
interest is growing what attracts people

164
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
the company new economies and things

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
that we see in the world

166
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,919
recently uh in the days of pandemics

167
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,120
when we have seen new reality new

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
channels of operations they started

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
growing respective company new economy

170
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,240
and with the time

171
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
these trends they came to our stock

172
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
exchange as well people started placing

173
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
money and this placement was conducted

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
and

175
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
investors

176
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,680
well they've been reacting positively to

177
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
this new information to these new

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
companies so if

179
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
not for these february events i think

180
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,919
this year we would see big amount of new

181
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,280
placements new i.t companies absolutely

182
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
diverse

183
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
companies

184
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,360
and on a step-by-step basis we could see

185
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
that

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
we see not only big scale companies

187
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,280
but also more local companies because

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120
the appetite for these risks does exist

189
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,080
i would add to these that for investors

190
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
who search for growth shares

191
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,759
what was important to them

192
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,400
to them it's important to see structural

193
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,639
growth potential in the industry and

194
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
it's always important for the investors

195
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,879
to select good quality companies and

196
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,000
leaders so the example of your company

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,879
shows us that

198
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,279
there is a high demand for these stories

199
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,360
and i would like to add to this in the

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
current realities when stock exchange

201
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,880
markets go through very complicated uh

202
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
life it is

203
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,959
very important for investors to invest

204
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
into stories which are growing stories

205
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,040
and profitable stories

206
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
and this is something that we're able to

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,279
see prior to february events and the

208
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
profitable companies they show even

209
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
higher market dynamics than companies

210
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,519
which require capital investments

211
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
another thing that i would like to add

212
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
to this in addition to the fact that

213
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
this sector is fundamentally growing one

214
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
it's much smaller

215
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,040
it depends less from what happens in the

216
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
current realities of macroeconomics if

217
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
there are basic sectors which are really

218
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,440
sensitive to gdp changes if respectively

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,880
gdp is dropping the demand for oil gas

220
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
and metals is also dropping your sector

221
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,720
cyber sector is fundamentally growing

222
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
sector and also in even in the most

223
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
pessimistic scenarios

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
plus in the conditions of the fact that

225
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
most of the foreign companies are

226
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
leaving this market

227
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,480
we see very big addressable market which

228
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
continues to grow

229
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,240
and not many companies have possibility

230
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
to broadcast this growth into positive

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
financial indicators what is important

232
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
for investors good quality market and

233
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
how

234
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,440
these companies are able to transform

235
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
this market share into growth and

236
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,279
profitable growth because historically

237
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,839
if you will take the sector of new

238
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,480
economy in wider sense we have seen a

239
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
lot of hype stories which have been

240
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
growing very fast but which still have

241
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
not become profitable but the main

242
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
difference of your story and cyber

243
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
security sector and positive technology

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
sector that this is fast growing company

245
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,720
which shows uh

246
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,760
growth

247
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,399
and growth not only on the top line of

248
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,160
revenue but also profit as well

249
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,880
what do you think will be the most

250
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
interesting for investors to know about

251
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
positive technologies

252
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
because we are technical guys and we

253
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,360
speak in a very specific language which

254
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,880
is not really understandable by my

255
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
audience and only our first experience

256
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,320
when we come to the market and we say

257
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
okay we're going to tell you about cyber

258
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,040
security one year ago when we were in

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
very different organizations

260
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
we've been told okay guys

261
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,079
why do you go to stock exchange it's

262
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,440
funny

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
but when we have announced that we are

264
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
not going to deny our plans to go to

265
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,920
stock exchange and we have added to this

266
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
that we're going to place ourselves for

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
physical investors without attracting

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,279
investment funds they've been uh

269
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
showing like that they said well we can

270
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,880
expect everything from you on the basis

271
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,440
of your plans but perhaps

272
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
something is exploding in your head and

273
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,320
that's why you're making fantasies but

274
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,160
life has happened like that and looks

275
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,920
like there are no other options in the

276
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,279
market and that's why we are

277
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,839
this little ship that floats in this

278
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
investment ocean and which attracts

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
attention

280
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
what would be interesting to investors

281
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,959
what should they learn about positive

282
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,440
well i would like to begin

283
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
if we're speaking about private

284
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,240
investors

285
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
they know brands

286
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
and when positive

287
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,120
to them it's not the brand which is

288
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
strong in the market of course it's

289
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,079
going to be important for them to know

290
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
your agents when you say that you work

291
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
with largest uh

292
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,839
russian private and state corporations

293
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,320
of course they all are known and the

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
level of trust to positive technologies

295
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,079
is

296
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,200
growing

297
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,839
at the account of these agents

298
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
in addition to that

299
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
business scale you have a lot of things

300
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,279
to show and profitability

301
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,959
i believe that these three positions are

302
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,800
very important

303
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
yes i will agree with eager and i would

304
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,399
like to add to these that we investors

305
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
should always hear

306
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
about the future

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,040
and it is important to explain why this

308
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,519
market is going to grow why companies

309
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,320
will invest more in cyber security how

310
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,279
much they're going to invest etc and

311
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
topic number two

312
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,320
as i've told you previously investors

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
love to invest money into leaders of the

314
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,800
market good quality story so we have to

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
show potential not only of the market

316
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,240
growth but also potential of positive

317
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,079
growth inside of this market how it's

318
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,920
going to grow its share in which

319
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,040
segments etc

320
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
and perhaps additionally

321
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,399
compared to institutional investors for

322
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
whom dividends are are important but not

323
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
always important in stories of growth

324
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
for physical dividends is something that

325
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
they can feel physically that's why the

326
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
fact that you have started paying

327
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
dividends

328
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
is a very big positive step forward

329
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,760
which happens and you can say that

330
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
you can earn money not only on the

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,480
potential of growth of exchange rate of

332
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
the shares but also on dividends

333
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,800
something that can be tangible

334
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
you say a lot that you need to be more

335
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,720
transparent about the market about

336
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
companies but today at 6 30 we are going

337
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,120
to

338
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
have presentation for investors where we

339
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,760
are going to tell about all of these and

340
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,040
i hope it's gonna be very transparent

341
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,760
and understandable because we have very

342
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,720
big educational part in cyber security

343
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
and everything that happens here during

344
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
this cyber fight

345
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,600
is our face of the cyber security that

346
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
this is not just some guys in odis uh

347
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
some lamps are blinking and it's not

348
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,360
understandable what is cyber security

349
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,600
we are showing that cyber security is a

350
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
well understandable thing and first of

351
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
all it's understandable by its results

352
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
which results should be understandable

353
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,079
non-admissible

354
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,560
events for different companies or for

355
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
different industries of economy should

356
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
not happen

357
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
everybody totally depends on digital

358
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
technologies and if

359
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,519
something happens like during this cyber

360
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,880
fight the spill of the oil the impact of

361
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,600
the trains some indecent content

362
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
published on billboards

363
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
theft of big amounts of money this is

364
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,519
inadmissible that shouldn't happen with

365
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,600
those companies and we are showing

366
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
people that these can be

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and the role of cyber security to

368
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,079
prevent from this so this is a basic

369
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,360
need

370
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
in our modern digital realities and the

371
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
completing question that i would like to

372
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,279
ask you about the future of the stock

373
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,000
exchange market you said that most

374
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
likely it's going to be the physical

375
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
investor market it's going to be the

376
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
interest to invest

377
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,399
into new direction of cyber security

378
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
how do you see a russian stock exchange

379
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
market in one year two years in midtown

380
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
perspective

381
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,560
well in current realities we leave now

382
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
one two years it's a very long period of

383
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,430
time

384
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,240
[Music]

385
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,199
but most likely the market will be

386
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,480
stabilized

387
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,880
at a certain moment of time

388
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,519
so i think that activities of russian

389
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,560
institutional investors will

390
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,120
be restored

391
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
also in addition to the existing types

392
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,079
of investors which available right now

393
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,199
first of all these are managing

394
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,440
companies we could see

395
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
new types of investors

396
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,040
which are not investing or investing

397
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,120
very weakly into the shares

398
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
well i'm speaking like pension funds

399
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,120
and if a legislation is going to change

400
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
perhaps we will be able to see new

401
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,240
institutional investors

402
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
and i believe that activity of physical

403
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
investors is going to grow respectively

404
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,000
to anything

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
so from this point of view in addition

406
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,199
to those factors that we just discussed

407
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
physical

408
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,639
entities they make decisions about

409
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,000
purchase and sales not alone they work

410
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,839
through big brokers and each broker has

411
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,799
a lot of analytics who write analytical

412
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,480
recommendations about companies and it

413
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,760
is very important

414
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,079
in making their research reports and

415
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
from their opinion from how they are

416
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,679
positive or negative

417
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,360
it will

418
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,600
[Music]

419
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,280
influence the appetite of investors

420
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
to purchase

421
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
new

422
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
cheers

423
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,400
well i will try to be optimistic as well

424
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
as we have discussed it's understandable

425
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
that investment base has changed

426
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
the market have changed and i do agree

427
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
that number of physical investors will

428
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,200
grow it is necessary

429
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
to have more russian local institutions

430
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
and funds who would invest money into

431
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,760
shares

432
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,160
for our stock exchange

433
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
this will take some time so it is

434
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
going to be very hard to speak what's

435
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
going to happen in several months or one

436
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,400
year or maybe two years but when this

437
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
will happen i believe that market will

438
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,240
come back to stable growth

439
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,280
i see the future of our market as

440
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
relatively positive and this is related

441
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,679
with the fact that

442
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,880
market was dropping private investors

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
they've been taking it very painfully

444
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
and it is very important to have this

445
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,200
feeling of this new level

446
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
and some exchange

447
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,799
growth so that investors

448
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,600
would not drop in their portfolio

449
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,280
psychologically it's a very important

450
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
factor well it's very clear that our

451
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
market will be separate and it's going

452
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
to be oriented on the internal investor

453
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,720
and what can we observe here

454
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
liquidity

455
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,559
we have enough liquidity in the country

456
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
we have a lot of investment tools that

457
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
were available they are available and

458
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,160
they have some of them have disappeared

459
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,520
and if we will see new ideas

460
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,640
then investors money will overflow there

461
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
and then we have this community

462
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
when companies

463
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
are placed on the stock exchange like on

464
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
the highest level

465
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
there will be structuring of the assets

466
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
and the highest level of responsibility

467
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
for investors it's very important so

468
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
that

469
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,960
would be

470
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
would behave correctly on the market

471
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
because the changes in certain sectors

472
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,720
they influence the whole market so

473
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,919
that's why

474
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,760
it is very important

475
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
to see a certain growth which is going

476
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,919
to help investors to stay and look

477
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,760
deeper in the existing options of where

478
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,080
they can invest their money

479
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
and the final blitz question

480
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
and answer it like yes or no

481
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,080
cyber security is a new oil and gas for

482
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
investors yes yes yes

483
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,880
okay thank you very much

484
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
it was a conversation about stock

485
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,520
exchange in new realities

486
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,240
and the interest to investments into

487
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,039
cyber security from the point of view of

488
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,320
physical

489
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,080
investors market
