1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,560
security market is actualized from the

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,559
point of view of records man from the

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,000
point of view of valuable specialists

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
and we don't have a lot of them in the

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,239
country and in recent months

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,960
big changes happened in what's really

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
happening in these markets so

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
how does the recruitment market looked

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,720
in cyber security we'll speak with

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,519
directly by chopin

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
specializing in attracting specialists

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,680
technical director and committee state

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
center

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
and a person who works with technical

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
people and with the clients

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
and maximum questions deputy head of the

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,519
department of defense of applications

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,239
[Music]

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,840
you are the person who is strong in the

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
market so what really happens in recent

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,039
months

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,559
on the recruitment market in our area

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
honestly speaking i think not much time

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,760
have passed because these were recent

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,959
events

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,119
so it's hard to speak about some trends

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,360
but uh we can say that there is

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,320
something waiting for us

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
people are getting relocated some people

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
select some international companies

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
new opportunities for themselves but i

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,720
think this agenda

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
has been

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
and we should spend more time on the

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,240
fact that many people

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
that we communicate with and that we

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
communicate within the market already

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
and they want to stay

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
with us in russia they're ready to

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,600
invest

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
in cyber security uh they're ready to

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,240
invest in the i.t and this agenda

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,920
results available maybe it's a little

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
bit underestimated not many people speak

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,520
about it and we don't hear about it

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
everybody says like everybody's moving

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,320
but how many people in positive have

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,919
relocated or left

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
people

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,800
and eight of them as i understand i may

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,120
not remember exactly are people who

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
change their mind in the process

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
so in principle if you will compare it

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
with the total number of positive people

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
we have 1300 people this is not a big

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
amount 35 people

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,550
moved

58
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,699
[Music]

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,319
and

60
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,360
technical especially

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,160
well if you look at my department

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,800
several people did have uh plans to go

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
abroad and they didn't cancel it so they

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,920
rested and came

65
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
there was nothing like we are going to

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,200
wait everybody's staying in russia

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,800
okay there's a lot of people who's been

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
working and continue to work in western

69
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
companies which leave a russian market

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
i've calculated approximately 40 foreign

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
i.t companies

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,959
have announced that they will seize

73
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
their activities or leave russia they've

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
announced it very cleverly they said

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
like we will stop it but in three months

76
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
we're going to come back and we'll tell

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,799
you about our final decision these three

78
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,640
months will end up in june

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
in case if

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
okay i will formulate this question

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
following wait so what do you think

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,599
dasha what are your feelings

83
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,879
maybe you have some additional

84
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
information

85
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
are we going to have on the market big

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
inflow of

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
people from the i.t world and i.t

security world in the course of nearest

89

man

90
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,319
you know these people already are coming

91
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,518
to our market because

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,159
being in such a state of uncertainty is

93
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,680
not very simple for people and some

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,200
people are looking at the market they're

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,560
getting doubts they're thinking about

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,320
some new opportunities so i don't know

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,839
but it is possible to say that it's

98
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,440
going to be some significant increase of

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,959
this number of people possibly there

100
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
will be possibly there will not be but a

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
certain percentage of people will be in

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
the market and possibly it's going to be

103
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,919
very interesting even to us these are

104
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,440
going to be interesting people to us yes

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
it's going to be it's a great

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,200
opportunity for the recruitment yes

107
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,320
[Music]

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
do we have a lot of people coming to us

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
yes we do have a lot of people coming to

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
us and right now we have an opportunity

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,560
of communicating with those people who

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
previously prior to all these situations

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,639
they were busy in other projects they've

114
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
been doing some other ambitions career

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
ambitions and right now they're open for

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
dialogue with positive and this is a

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
cool opportunity that would like to

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
maximize

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,600
and those people

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
who in some sense been doubting about

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
cyber security in our country they

122
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
didn't believe that they will be

123
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
developing in this area as they wanted

124
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
to

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
right now they have changed their

126
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
opinions significantly because well

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,639
honestly the situation is everything

128
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,600
like

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
that we have a really viable environment

130
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,080
in the cyber security and you understand

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,360
that there is a demand for your needs

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
there is a demand for your product and

133
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,120
if we're speaking about some products

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
especially there's a possibility of

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
realizing those goals and bring some

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
good to people

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,440
so who's going to be the next one

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
nobody's going to argue with the fact

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,479
that

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,960
as a country we have significant export

141
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
potential

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
uh

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
medicine or culture i.t and irrespective

144
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
it's what happens nothing's changing in

145
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,680
this industry

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,319
right now i think this is the right time

147
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
to review our positions in this area and

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
to understand what uh usefulness you can

149
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,919
bring to russian cyber security and

150
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,120
speaking about the trends which are

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
happening with specialists

152
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
which are working in american and other

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
foreign companies

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
if we're going to open facebook

155
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,479
and if we're going to look at what

156
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,319
really happens with people who are

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
significant experts in their industries

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
well they did have certain changes that

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
we see

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
tell me about it which you see

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,318
well to my point of view

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
there are several transitions uh and i'm

163
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
speaking about people with thousands of

164
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,039
subscribers people who know about

165
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,199
networking security or the monitoring

166
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
systems and they are changing their

167
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
employers some of them are thinking

168
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
about it we're not going to hide that

169
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,159
we are being

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
and information security guys what are

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
they thinking about well

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
they are very contradictory those

173
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
thoughts but in the framework of the

174
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
company but you can see recent events

175
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
have not influenced us at all because we

176
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
first of all we are experts and we do

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,759
our expertise we are helping we are

178
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
protecting

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,319
people who come to us

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
in other words

181
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
we can do more and we can help more

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
jaina how do you see your place in this

183
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,479
well being in the office i've noticed

184
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
especially during first days that there

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,039
are two types of feelings neutrality

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,000
majority of employees

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,720
and they are trying to be here and now

188
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
and they don't project whatever happens

189
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
to themselves on themselves

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
does the number of employees which due

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
to several reasons they made the

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
decision uh so that temporarily they

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,919
will wait for the end of this situation

194
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
in some other format

195
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,319
so

196
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
i would say it in the following way

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
globally

198
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
situation is in the proportion of 1 to

199
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
10.

200
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,039
90 of people they kept their

201
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,919
professional

202
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,080
activities and state and some employees

203
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
speaking about ambitions of technical

204
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,840
people

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
many of them especially for researchers

206
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,360
developers for many of them it's

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,799
important to have an access to

208
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,440
international companies international

209
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
market traveling and clients

210
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
what do you think right now will this

211
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,600
situation be reflected on their moods

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
because things that i see many people

213
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
don't like those limitations that we

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,399
have right now

215
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
well i think the story is following

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
speaking about positive technologies

217
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,519
looks like

218
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,600
we have an advantage here

219
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
compared to other companies

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
specialist

221
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
we provide great opportunities in

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,279
informational security

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,720
it gives you a possibility that

224
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
something is highly demanded right now

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
and it means stability of the company it

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
means that you constantly have

227
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,040
interesting tasks etc so some i.t people

228
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,160
were really tuned uh for international

229
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
story by the possibility of using some

230
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
foreign resources but right now this

231
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
opportunity is not available at all in

232
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
russia however there are companies like

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
positive technologies with a lot of

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,720
internal cool opportunities

235
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
where you can participate

236
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
and because of these

237
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
the interest is growing to our vacancies

238
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
to our business

239
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
but what do you think from the technical

240
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
point of view and from business point of

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,920
view maybe

242
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
a person would be interested who worked

243
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
in the area of a t and not a security

244
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
and can you go to the company like the

245
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,839
tf technologies or any other company

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
well generally speaking at positive

247
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
technologies

248
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
the profile of our employees

249
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
is not an expert in informational

250
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
security

251
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
we're a company which provides services

252
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,600
we're a company

253
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,480
which

254
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,279
develops software we are a company which

255
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,160
is involved in realization of large

256
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
complex projects and implements

257
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
technical solutions so wide spectrum of

258
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,839
actions and i would say

259
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
not to reprofile

260
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,040
but we also waiting for specialists

261
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,880
who are experts in the area-weight

262
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,640
infrastructure

263
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,839
who are professional

264
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,680
programmers simply speaking

265
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
and of course in the area of

266
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,839
informational security yes so i wouldn't

267
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,880
differentiate that right now we have to

268
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
re-profile into the

269
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,359
security guys

270
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
well we have very complicated products

271
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
uh overloaded products with very

272
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,360
complicated under the hood uh stuff and

273
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
it's not always obvious uh for people

274
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
from i.t what is cyber security what

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
kind of products we are developing

276
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
but if you will dig deeper and if you

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
will look we have very complicated

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
products uh

279
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
with which it's very interesting to work

280
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
well hacker attack happened

281
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,959
and this is about the interest of

282
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,120
working with cyber security and right

283
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,399
now we've had

284
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,600
a big break a big explosion

285
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,279
loud voices and we've received

286
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
information that hackers attacked oil

287
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
and gas company tube

288
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
substitution of proportions of oil

289
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
mixture and technological process sounds

290
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,399
so awful well this is about the interest

291
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,120
of working service

292
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800

298
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,079
because our product uh uh we need a

press vacancies on the positive pages

344
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
but it's a specific uh list of vacancies

345
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
primitive thing but the story is that we

346
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
are looking for talent and we are ready

347
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199

348
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,360
show some creativity

349
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,320
it depends on which side some people use

350
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
letters just write to the email to be

351
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,600
noticed with a certain

352
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
some people go through recommendations

353
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,839
because cyber security market is a very

354
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,519
small one you know somebody somebody

355

technology is such a big team and there

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,839
are no specialists which are outside of

362
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,519
positiveness but they don't know at

363
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,600
least one person from positive

364
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
yes

365
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,160
and a final

366
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,079
question that i have to and will sound

367
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
the following way

368
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,040
each one of you can you give me one

369
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
phrase

370
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,839
why you need to come to positive

371
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,800
technologies you can advise with each

372
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,079
other i will give you about 10 seconds

373
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,760
and now here's a question

374
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,120
[Music]

375
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,279
i have the answer because i gave this

376
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,680
answer to myself

377
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,519
i think it's incomparable capability to

378
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
work with a russian cyber security

379
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
industry

380
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
well i also wanted to speak about real

381
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
cyber security maybe i formulated

382
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
differently but i think that positive is

383
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
involved in real security

384
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,839
i'm not a technical specialist i cannot

385
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
speak on the level of technical people

386
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
but i see it this way i believe that

387
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,360
this is one of the main reasons why i

388
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,759
work here

389
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
also we'll have a long phrase because

390
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,560
practical security

391
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
i cannot express it in beautiful words

392
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
how nice it is for me to work with

393
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360

394
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,399
what they do
