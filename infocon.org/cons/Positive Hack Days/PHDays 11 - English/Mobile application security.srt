1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,600
now we're going to speak about what do

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
we have in our pockets

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,160
mobile phones

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,160
mobile phone with a lot of applications

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,600
we're going to speak about mobile

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
applications with nikolai head of

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
security of mobile obligations and

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,560
positive technologies hello

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,599
everybody has mobile

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,480
we always are afraid for the information

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
that we have in our mobile phones those

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
i.t services that we use

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
can you tell us which other recent

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
trends threats

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
changes in the area of mobile

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,719
phones and mobile applications

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,120
in the year 2021 the leadership is kept

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,800
by the vulnerabilities on unsafe storage

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
it's a class of vulnerabilities

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,520
on the level of one third of

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
vulnerabilities is vulnerabilities of

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
this class

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,439
but we have to point out that

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,000
in a lot of cases it's very hard to read

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
this information so you speak about the

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,159
safety of mobile data

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,880
so the access to my photos

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
to my mobile files

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
not even about files or photos

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,119
because access to photos is regulated by

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,600
given by the user to applications

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,360
by the access to the container of

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,720
applications because every container

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
well every application has its own

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,759
container to which other applications

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
don't have access and they usually store

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
some storage keys

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,759
encoding keys maybe there's some other

39
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,159
data which allows them to identify user

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
some token or whatever and speaking

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
about these examples i have the banking

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
mobile application and let's say

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
some social network

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
which of my data is stored in both of

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,200
these applications and

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
especially when you speak that these

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
data is stored in these containers

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
what's so important maybe stored there

49
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,959
well they can have some cash so that

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,319
same photos are not going to be

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
downloaded for the same time then they

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
can store

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,319
some of the communications which are

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,560
available after internet have

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
disappeared it's very convenient to

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
enter the messenger and look at some

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
messages even if you don't have internet

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
at this particular place

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
and if the criminal well the secrecy of

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
communication has to be protected but

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,959
the most critical thing is that token

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
by sending which mobile application

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,160
allows the server to

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
see you

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,319
and do certain actions in a system on

66
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
behalf of the user so this is a certain

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
key which allows my mobile application

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,120
to get authorized on the side of a

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
certain service for example a bank

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,519
it's some big value which is very

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,159
difficult to uh forecast but if it's

72
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
stored unsafely and certain

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
vulnerabilities allow you to read it uh

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
the pure so the criminal when he gets

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
this token his actions will not be

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
different from the actions of regular

77
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
user so by stealing this data from my

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
application this person will be able

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,760
from his own mobile device to enter and

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,400
simulate as if i'm doing it

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,519
it's not just for mobile devices

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
and he will get full access to this

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
service that i was using on behalf of my

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
name

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
yeah some actions they require

86
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,480
communication uh confirmation by one

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
time

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
so he is not going to get access to

89
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
these actions but for example well

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
compared to

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,720
well speaking about learning the

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,920
passport and

93
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
if hiding a token

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
he can create a dual factor

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
authentication so if we send token one

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
time password will not be required for

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,799
all the actions but if you put a login

98
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
and password

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
then in many modern services especially

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
the most critical ones it's not going to

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
work and you have to take this one-time

102
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
password from authentic or sms message

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,959
it's going to be much more difficult

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,400
okay i understand that this data is

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
stored on the mobile device and let's go

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,880
back to the trends

107
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
leadership is the vulnerabilities of

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
this class and exploiting

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
they can be exploited in different ways

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
one of those ways is when you install

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
malicious code in your device in other

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,479
ways when you can follow certain links

113
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,680
because not many people know about

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
mobile applications as sites they can

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
process links

116
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
but locally on the device so following

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
certain links

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
it might happen that some of these links

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
can be malicious and it might attack

120
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
your device or an application so it can

121
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
be an entry point for the criminal to

122
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
exploit different vulnerabilities

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
including

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
uh still something that is stored

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
unsafely and this year in the year 2021

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
we've been discovering vulnerabilities

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,479
which allow criminals to get around in

128
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
build mechanisms of protection or

129
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,039
frameworks which are used by developers

130
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
of creating applications

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
and

132
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
they're able to get to that data which

133
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
is difficult to extract in another way

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
so the data may be stored very

135
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
unsecurely but it's difficult to get

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,800
access to them

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,639
without encoding or your store something

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
that shouldn't be stored or you store

139
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,919
something that

140
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,600
in the wrong place

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
but what it's connected to it's

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
connected to the fact that for example

143
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
right now the same framework uh

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
flutter is actively being broadcast and

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
many people use it

146
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
structure by its design it's not that

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
it's closing the hands of the developer

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,639
but it helps them to write a more

149
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
complicated code it's very more it's

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,479
more complicated to write to read this

151
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
code it has the protection from the

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
traffic interception

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
and speaking about flatter development

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
it's much more difficult to develop bad

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
code and last year we've seen that

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
analysis systems of those applications

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
are late

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
and right now we see that we see more

159
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
and more articles among developers which

160
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
show how to analyze the malicious

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,199
applications and applications for

162
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
surgical vulnerabilities and our experts

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
philippe nikiforov have developed

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
a tool like reef ladder which helps

165
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,479
researchers

166
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,360
to

167
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
look at the applications written in

168
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
platter so why am i speaking about it

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,199
there is a certain trend among

170
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,440
developers to rely on in-build

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
protection frameworks of operational

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
system uh production mechanisms for

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,840
example android makes big steps in the

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
direction for the developers to make

175
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
less errors and from year to year we see

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,599
that less and less functions are

177
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
available by default and

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,840
you have to announce certain functions

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
of applications obviously

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
you have to announce them only in those

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,759
cases when you need them

182
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
when they've been announced by default

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,719
in some old versions

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,680
it gave extended surface of attack for

185
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
the attacker so developers had to follow

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
so that they wouldn't open the extra

187
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
doors and speaking about the production

188
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
of mobile operation systems

189
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
they can be looked from two sides

190
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
android and ios right

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
basically yes two of them

192
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,639
can we compare them

193
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,479
one is more protected which one is less

194
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,599
protected

195
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
well it's not that you can but you have

196
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,120
to compare

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
and they are very similar especially

198
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,880
when it's been speaking that every

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,479
application works in its own container

200
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,840
but there are certain difficulties for

201
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,560
example inter process messaging system

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,879
is more developed in the android

203
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,120
operating system

204
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
which means that one mobile application

205
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,000
can communicate with another one so if i

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
have installed a malicious software

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
containing malicious code in my device

208
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
it can get access to another application

209
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,319
right

210
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,919
yeah some application can announce

211
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,639
functions which can be called from other

212
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
for example you enter the gallery

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
you press share the folder you see the

214
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
list of applications which have the

215
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
function of sharing the photos

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
in ios it works a little bit differently

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
this mechanism is available but it's

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,199
realized with extensions in applications

219
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
and these extensions

220
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,318
are hidden separate containers

221
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
they follow certain protocols so it's

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,559
much more difficult to make an error but

223
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,760
then draw it

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
it's done within one application and the

225
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
vulnerabilities are related in these

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
inter processes relations

227
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
and in the most critical cases

228
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
you can drop a link

229
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
without installing any malicious code

230
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
because

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,360
links can be realized in those

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
applications

233
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
else you can install certain malicious

234
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
code which at certain moments of time

235
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,800
certain file will be substituted and

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,880
maybe unseen for the user

237
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
with this inter process relations they

238
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,200
will intercept some vulnerable

239
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
application and it's going to happen

240
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,680
like that which rules one had to follow

241
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
while using android in order not to

242
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
become a victim considering the fact

243
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
that the architecturally

244
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
it is assumed that first of all the

245
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,600
operating system is more open than ios

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
and second of all that he has a

247
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
possibility of such relations between

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,959
applications

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
because it opens a lot of

250
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,519
vulnerabilities for the

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,640
android

252
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
so the android user should be more

253
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,880
prepared and educated than ios

254
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
to withstand hacker attacks

255
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
well he should understand which attacks

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,880
we're fighting because everything

257
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
depends on the model of the

258
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,440
uh if we are afraid against despite uh

259
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
obligations like camera and

260
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,279
well vulnerabilities well this can be

261
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
done in android and ios devices but on

262
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,640
the other side if you're afraid of the

263
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
attack against our banking application

264
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
then android user not in more danger but

265
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,640
you he should understand

266
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,600
that probability of making a mistake in

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
android applications much higher so

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
please don't download from unprotected

269
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
stores and this is actual trend by the

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,160
way

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
applications of certain banks

272
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,839
they've been removed from official

273
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,600
markets from which you have to download

274
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
it so users are looking for the

275
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
possibility for example by buying new

276
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,200
iphone and transferring data

277
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,399
they don't

278
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,920
are not able to transfer this bank

279
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
application and they are installing it

280
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
from third-party

281
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
sources it's better to go to the banks

282
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
and banks are making steps towards those

283
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
users and helping them in

284
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
installing these applications properly

285
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,519
and you can install these applications

286
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,720
for android and for iphone

287
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
okay let's speak about it and let's go

288
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,040
back to ios afterwards many mobile

289
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,440
applications as including banks they

290
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
have been removed from the

291
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
app stores

292
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
what should we do

293
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,040
you go to the bank for example i would

294
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
like to install zbr bank application

295
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,079
it's not available in app store or

296
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,880
google play then i go to the bank and

297
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
ask them to give me the link how it

298
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
works

299
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
first of all irrespectively to which

300
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
bank it is

301
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
you should go to the official site

302
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
from your mobile phone because usually

303
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
it is defined that you came from your

304
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
mobile phone and usually you're being

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
offered to install the application and

306
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
mostly

307
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
most likely bank has provided this case

308
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
because for android you can download apk

309
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,839
file for ios you can follow the link

310
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,920
you can confirm the trust to the

311
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
developer and then like in windows it's

312
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,839
going to be installed

313
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
if this is done in the bank then user

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,360
iphone user without losing leaving

315
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
safari is going to be able to use that

316
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
and the android user will make a check

317
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,079
mark well install the application from

318
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
untrusted sources or maybe

319
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
from the trusted source but you have to

320
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,880
be convinced that you download it from

321
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
the official source

322
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
which you trust for example it's a bank

323
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,079
employee it gave you in a support chart

324
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
in the web version or maybe

325
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,079
in a bank department or the technical

326
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
support department the person have sent

327
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
you an sms message it happens

328
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,880
differently on my uh phone it works but

329
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,360
i know of cases when my friends went to

330
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
the bank and they've been helped to

331
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
install application around the market

332
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
okay let's go back go back to the ios

333
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,600
operation system

334
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,760
i'm confident that 99.5 of users on the

335
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
iphone are convinced that well i don't

336
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
care about this all this hacker attacks

337
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
because i have my phone and it's well

338
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
protected

339
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
is it yeah

340
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
can you give us examples of attacks

341
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,959
against ios users

342
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,040
maybe not exotic ones but common ones

343
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,519
well the most common attack against user

344
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,399
and not application because

345
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,200
this is attached to the malicious code

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
and it's leading in the course of

347
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
several years like some phishing in the

348
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
web or to the internet a person

349
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
downloads some untrusted applications so

350
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
being an iphone user i receive a link

351
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,760
both like in email or

352
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,320
through the messenger not mandatory this

353
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
is one of the options but malicious

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
codes can be enough store in the play

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
market as well

356
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,680
because even though they have

357
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,839
verification processes and it's been

358
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,240
verified but it's not ideal condition

359
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
and very often malicious software are

360
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
leaking there there was a case when

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
developers are from china

362
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
mistake they've downloaded uh unlicensed

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
code because they cannot buy licensed

364
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,439
gold even though it was not expensive

365
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,560
during the assembly of the application

366
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,959
they've added a malicious library so

367
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,880
developers by publishing their

368
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,079
application they didn't know they're

369
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
publishing the malicious code

370
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
so even with the help of such scenarios

371
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
malicious code can enter your device and

372
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,240
not only in case when the uh somebody

373
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
has discovered something in his phone

374
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
oh i'm a user i'm the iphone user my

375
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,199
productivity is just recently i received

376
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
a doubtful letter from the bank i didn't

377
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
know whether it's a bank's letter or not

378
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,399
it had a link

379
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,720
i pressed it

380
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,639
the phone started downloading this link

381
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,120
i thought maybe something doubtful and

382
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,920
i've stopped safari was there a chance

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
that i was caught by some virus yes of

384
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,960
course there was a chance

385
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,049
[Music]

386
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,839
because different vulnerabilities work

387
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,680
differently

388
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,639
in some

389
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
other vulnerabilities they don't need

390
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,519
any cooperation with the user it's a

391
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,800
zero click one

392
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
like for the iphone yeah

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,040
regularly they find a lot of different

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
uh commands in those vulnerabilities in

395
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
a messenger they recently discovered one

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
of those

397
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,760
in whatsapp last year there was uh such

398
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
vulnerability about some vulnerabilities

399
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
they need uh cooperation of the user and

400
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
there's a chance

401
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,560
that you had to wait to the download of

402
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
the page for the vulnerability to work

403
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
i've discovered some of them

404
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,480
then timely closing can help you

405
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
but you shouldn't try to open it not in

406
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
a private folder not in regular folder

407
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,519
especially speaking about those links

408
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,000
because if the link is being processed

409
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
it doesn't matter private uh or not

410
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
private but if you have any doubts

411
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
you've pressed uh doubtful link

412
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,560


413
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
it's a fact

414
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,720
what should you do next

415
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
first of

416
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,839
you need to log off of the bank

417
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,600
application

418
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,839
then you should clean the safari cache

419
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,759
if you followed non-private link because

420
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,800
sometimes there's a possibility of

421
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
kill the browser's cache in application

422
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
and by this attack will be discovered

423
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,959
much earlier so the attack will not be

424
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,959
used by the connection to the unsafe

425
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,639
wi-fi

426
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
you can do something like that you can

427
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
re-download the application

428
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
so you should put mobile phone in such a

429
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
condition when uh malicious code is not

430
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,959
going to work the simplest one is to

431
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,839
clean the cache yes

432
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,600
and the final question i have to you

433
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,639
know

434
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,759
in recent months did you see any new

435
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,519
techniques

436
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,959
practices of attacks against mobile

437
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,439
users

438
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,680
honestly

439
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,040
i didn't see any new techniques

440
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
they use the most tested ones

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,799
criminals want to get some profit

442
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,400
from the attack

443
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
so they're using maximally effective

444
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
methods

445
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,400
and as i've told you the most effective

446
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,119
method is to make the user to download

447
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,959
some malicious code

448
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
which looks like the application clone

449
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
or a free version

450
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,679
for the bank's version which was deleted

451
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,400
from the market

452
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,799
this can be considered as those trends

453
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,720
which are followed by the criminals and

454
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,280
they use any case to do it and a final

455
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
question

456
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
what should i do right now

457
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,200
in order to clear my doubts that

458
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
potentially in my mobile device i might

459
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
have some malicious code what should i

460
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,720
do

461
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
scale the browser's cache

462
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,120
it's not necessary

463
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,559
if you have certain dots first of all

464
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,919
you can look which applications have

465
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,080
been installed not for applications yes

466
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
and remove them

467
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,799
in iphone they have screen time and do

468
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,039
you see an application which uh starts

469
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
automatically so applications which work

470
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,960
and you don't even know about that

471
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,440
yeah most likely

472
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
there might be nothing interesting and

473
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,720
you can find something interesting out

474
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
there also you can look at applications

475
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
which work in the night

476
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,840
right

477
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,480
yes you can look at those applications

478
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,000
don't look at what is installed on the

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
phone but which service has been used

480
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
for example

481
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,039
different social networks and diverting

482
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,240
accounts uh in a profile section they

483
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,280
can see from which devices the session

484
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,679
was initiated in this application

485
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
and you can use unused ones for example

486
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,200
telegram allows you to look for example

487
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
i have access from three devices my work

488
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
computer notebook and mobile application

489
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
if due to some reason i see the fourth

490
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
device

491
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,799
for me

492
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,799
it's a good sign something went wrong

493
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,400
maybe i've entered from another phone or

494
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,679
maybe is

495
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,760
my password have leaked

496
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
so you can also look from this point of

497
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
view and in order to keep yourself on

498
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,799
the safe side

499
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,240
not completely but become less

500
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,559
attractive victim and this is related

501
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,880
not only to mobile application users you

502
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,520
should use a two-factor authentication

503
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
everywhere then you become

504
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,320
super non-interesting victim it's better

505
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,039
to attack those who don't have this

506
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
and don't get connected to doubtful

507
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,360
wi-fi points and speaking about trends

508
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,679
uh sports within recent months please

509
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
use that vpn which you trust because a

510
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,799
vpn is being attacked by the middleman

511
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,440
man in the middle

512
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,880
non-trusted vpn because it's the gateway

513
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
for your device

514
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
is the if the application has

515
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
vulnerability in the area of data

516
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,799
transfer but how do you know that this

517
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
is a bad ppl by the number of users

518
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,559
there's a simple one for example you

519
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,360
enter a certain

520
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
site

521
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,799
very popular site like yandex google or

522
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,679
whatever and suddenly browser tells you

523
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,480
that

524
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
connection is not safe please confirm

525
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
that you want to use untrusted

526
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,559
certificate

527
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320
it's a good indicator that something

528
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
wrong with the connection and sometimes

529
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
when you have a blocking

530
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
before you enter the number of your room

531
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
sometimes no

532
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,919
sometimes the certificate has been

533
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,840
replaced for example some obligations

534
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
the safest and the most popular ones

535
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
that you use like messengers or the same

536
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
telegrams and whatever suddenly they

537
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,159
stop working

538
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
which can witness us that these

539
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
connections are not reliable

540
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,000
and applications decided not to use it

541
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,360
it can give you a message that the

542
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
connection is not reliable some bank

543
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
applications do something like that or

544
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
maybe it's not going to give it it may

545
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
be an error without saying but you

546
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,919
should pay attention to the fact that

547
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,280
some

548
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,919
vpn services are making money in other

549
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,600
way thank you very much thank you very

550
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,679

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,280

scale powerful and modern computer and

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,679
criminal doesn't care

556
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,159
he will attack you to this small device

557
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
or to the big computer his main goal

558
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
is to do something for his own benefits

559
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,799
