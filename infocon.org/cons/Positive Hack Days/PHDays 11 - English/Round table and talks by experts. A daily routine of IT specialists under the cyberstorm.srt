00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,640
in march accenture announced its removal

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
from the russian market

36
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,320
we

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,960
localized

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
we disconnected from the global company

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
and

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
95

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,399
of our rit was in the global cloud

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,920
accordingly

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,930
we had to

44
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,840
[Music]

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,720
quickly uh

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
generate our own i.t infrastructure and

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,879
protect it this is the main change

48
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
that took place

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
in the company and i can share my

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
experience about the change

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
inside the company what did you feel

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
now you are independent russian company

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
and not part of the global international

54
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,560
brand

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
more freedom or

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
lot

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
well of course a lot of things has

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,280
changed

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
have changed every day we see some more

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
changes

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,920
but the company has uh very well

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
developed processes and we just continue

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
moving along those directions like a

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,720
well

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,480
uh

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,040
accelerated

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,599
train uh the rules have changed a bit

68
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
uh we built our business in the russian

69
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
market and the rules

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
are

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
have not just changed they are in the

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
process of change

73
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
every day

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,239
we are

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,200
we operate in the crisis conditions we

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
look

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,120
at what is most important

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
you can

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
we do consultancy integration

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,680
development everything related to i.t

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,480
and all the limitations

82
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
related to removal of international

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
vendors affect us the i.t infrastructure

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
was built on russian solutions

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
and even when

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,680
we had a choice

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
whether to

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
[Music]

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,879
look at

90
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
international vendors in cyber security

91
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,519
we decided to reduce risks mitigate

92
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,720
risks

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,599
and we work with russian vendors

94
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,599
only

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,600
so we're going to discuss russian

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
solutions as well

97
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
what has changed

98
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
in your company

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
and what you do

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
in the latest

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,320
weeks and months

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,120
in the company well we had a lot of

103
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
changes we have a

104
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
manufacturing holding 15 factories

105
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,880
one of the factories in ukraine so we

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
couldn't but change

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
we're part of big

108
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,479
projects some of the projects are

109
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,639
slowed down others are accelerating

110
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,720
as for it the

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
general situation is

112
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
like that

113
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
we worked as usual

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,199
the

115
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,160
foundation of our infrastructure and

116
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
applications are in the same state as

117
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,280
before some vendors

118
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
withdrew

119
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
and if it

120
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,479
doesn't affect us now it will affect us

121
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,880
sometime later because we have a lot of

122
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
development

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,479
technological

124
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,720
uh development

125
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
they require specific systems

126
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
and those systems are most often

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
non-russian of course we have some

128
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,000
russian analogs but they are way beyond

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
way behind

130
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,919
but in general

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,800
we didn't feel any shocks in i.t

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
it's not the shock that we

133
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,960
exp

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,599
felt in 2017

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
some people

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
did something wrong in our

137
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
network

138
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
and but we did a lot of a good job after

139
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,840
that

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
and

141
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
now we feel

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,759
confident

143
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
comfortable and confident alexander

144
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
alexander

145
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
for you i would like to change the

146
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,440
question a bit

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,720
you represent services

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,840
you provide services to

149
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,440
business especially now

150
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,759
what has changed in customer

151
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
requirements and your interaction with

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,198
them

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
actually

154
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,319
sanctions were imposed on us in april

155
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,479
2021

156
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,080
so we were a bit better prepared

157
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
uh we had

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
more

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
work because

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,360
demand for our products and services

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
grew up

162
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,599
we started selling more hardware

163
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,520
and services

164
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,280
we hired more people

165
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
and that was the biggest problem

166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
logistics

167
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,960
delivery of servers notebooks

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
that was the biggest problem

169
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,719
because we needed a lot

170
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,720
so the number of attacks increased

171
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,319
and

172
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,199
we have been preparing we had cyber

173
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
exercises

174
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,520
we didn't

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
feel anything bad but we have much more

176
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
work than before sergey

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,599
when preparing to this round table

178
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,800
sergey told us that he used the previous

179
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
months

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,479
for replacing the

181
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,479
old

182
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
we didn't have uh

183
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
agreement from business everything is

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
working

185
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
why do you want to replace it it's

186
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,679
legacy well but it works one day we're

187
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,559
going to replace it unfortunately or

188
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,319
unfortunately the situation changed

189
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,440
we closed quite a number of gaps

190
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
when

191
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,880
the company takes a decision

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
isn't it is security important i mean

193
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
data security

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
well i think so

195
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
we all realized that all the risks that

196
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,399
were hypothetical

197
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,360
now that happened once a year

198
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,399
now they happen every day

199
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,200
so yes

200
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,760
and also one more question you are the

201
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
only person here

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,600
uh who offer mass services you work with

203
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
millions of people

204
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,839
uh how more difficult

205
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
it is to work with them now it's

206
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
difficult but

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,680
there is

208
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,080
nothing that we were not prepared for

209
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
mass

210
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
large-scale services

211
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
faced

212
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
problems before

213
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,839
now it doesn't happen once every month

214
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,279
we have it

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,839
on a regular basis every day

216
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,320
has anything changed in your work ros

217
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,399
security

218
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,040
have always been a priority

219
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,439
for you

220
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
do you feel

221
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,839
additional threats now

222
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,360
good afternoon

223
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,480
yes that is true

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
security is paramount safety and

225
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,200
security first it's our slogan rule

226
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
number one

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
in nuclear industry

228
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
not only in our

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
nuclear power

230
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,399
division but in all corporations

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
that we belong to

232
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,959
theoretically

233
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,200
from the viewpoint of data security

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,560
uh we see more

235
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
threats

236
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,600
threats

237
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
more

238
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,560
insecurity

239
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,880
before we had about six attacks per

240
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
second

241
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,880
i said okay let's not count

242
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
together with i.t

243
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
i was lucky because i

244
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
am responsible for

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
security and i.t together

246
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,480
from

247
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,440
i.t from

248
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
the i.t and security people rebuild

249
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
business processes

250
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,839
when we deploy a system

251
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,880
when we

252
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,880
um

253
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,600
some of the

254
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
ways and say no

255
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
this is

256
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
out of the way

257
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,839
we just cut it off

258
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,240
imposed additional

259
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
workload

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,440
caused additional anxiety

261
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
of course we're trying to solve those

262
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
problems

263
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
as for the software

264
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,519
we were quite serious about

265
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,920
import substitution by 2022.

266
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
about 66

267
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
of users

268
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,270
work

269
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,449
[Music]

270
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,560
uh

271
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,760
is

272
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,320
substituted in the area of

273
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,440
digital security

274
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,600
so import substitution is what we need

275
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,160
and we need it fast and it exerts

276
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,639
additional pressure on us

277
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,600
because not all the software can be

278
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,160
replaced quickly

279
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,680
at once

280
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
so we have to do it step by step

281
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,639
we need to do it in such a way as

282
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,680
to

283
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
facilitate business business should not

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
suffer

285
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,000
so you touched

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
an important point

287
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,399
withdrawal of

288
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
western

289
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,880
technologies and services what which

290
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,480
technologies products and services

291
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,800
was were the most painful which was most

292
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,160
difficult to replace what is our biggest

293
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
problem now

294
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,600
is anyone ready yes you're welcome

295
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,079
let me

296
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
software

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,720
maybe a campaign for the air company

298
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,839
itv of

299
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,360
course it's i.t replacement

300
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,639
vendors who are moving away a

301
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,639
very specific

302
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
system

303
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
fuel calculation

304
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
bye

305
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,600
you have to find analogs

306
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,760
which were more or less known but

307
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
you have to

308
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,399
shift

309
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
every day and you shift every day and

310
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
new withdrawal

311
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,000
anyway

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,279
everyday new replacement as for hardware

313
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,560
networks

314
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,839
network equipment

315
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,959
servers

316
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,360
are more or less available but

317
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,519
high-performance network

318
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,959
equipment

319
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,480
from the viewpoint of security and

320
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
backbones that will be the biggest

321
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
problem

322
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,720
with companies

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
alexander

324
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,519
how will

325
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,639
do you cope with

326
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
fulfilling your obligation

327
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,880
when western

328
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,839
services withdraw

329
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,360
we didn't

330
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
face any

331
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
big problems

332
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,639
zoom

333
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,800
replacement was the most difficult but

334
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,079
we found a russian replacement

335
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
it's the only one we have a green

336
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
company and

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
we cannot say use this you don't use

338
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,639
that our people our employees must say

339
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
that this is really good zoom was the

340
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
leader

341
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,600
and

342
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,959
uh replacement was difficult but we

343
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
found a good solution

344
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,839
our

345
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,440
infrastructure servers

346
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
and storage

347
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,680
network

348
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
well we didn't deploy any specific

349
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,440
systems our erm and crp systems were

350
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
russian based so we

351
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,599
started preparing long ago

352
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,240
was there anything that you were afraid

353
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,280
of

354
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
that someone is going to

355
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,760
withdraw but

356
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
there was nothing

357
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,559
difficult to replace it maybe you relied

358
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,919
too much

359
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
on some product but when the product

360
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,880
disappeared you didn't

361
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
see any difficulty we use a lot of

362
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
products first of all

363
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
it's very difficult to replace the

364
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
products

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
which has a lot of

366
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,480
rnd components

367
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
so we need serious calculations

368
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
withdrawal of vendors

369
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,799
didn't stop

370
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,679
our processes of course we're not going

371
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,280
to get

372
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,799
new versions of several

373
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,840
programs but it will affect us in a year

374
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,440
two years three years we don't know what

375
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
we're going to do then

376
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
but we shall wait and see

377
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,280
but the systems that

378
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
require continuous operations

379
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,760
were not critical for us

380
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,679
security before checkpoint withdrawal

381
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,720
worked

382
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
well

383
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
and we have to support it

384
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
otherwise

385
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,600
it makes no sense so we didn't have any

386
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
significant problems there

387
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,919
naturally

388
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,919
we have to

389
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,720
install local products

390
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,360
because we look into the future

391
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
and

392
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,919
maybe we have to react we shall have to

393
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,799
react

394
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,240
quite

395
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
quickly

396
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,679
you said

397
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
um

398
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,360
[Music]

399
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,640
you said

400
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,919
that

401
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,840
you are responsible for analysis of the

402
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,200
russian services russian software

403
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,520
to look for analogs and alternatives to

404
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
withdrawing technologies and what did

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,120
you see

406
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,280
how wide is the choice

407
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
how good are the alternatives

408
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
well look

409
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,320
we had an x day

410
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
when we were disconnected from all

411
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,879
global services

412
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,480
[Music]

413
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,720
2500 notebooks were disconnected we had

414
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,440
the crisis management team

415
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
in they touched business infrastructure

416
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
security

417
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160
and they analyzed analogs

418
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,720
for everything that we used before

419
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,679
and

420
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
we didn't have time at all and

421
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,520
we often chose the products and services

422
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
by marketing

423
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
not by deep analysis

424
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,200
and

425
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
we installed some of them

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
and we're going to work with them for

427
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,520
about six months and then we have to

428
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,600
improve them or replace them

429
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,260
it's my emotional

430
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,760
[Music]

431
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,240
uh opinion

432
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,799
it's a choice without choice

433
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,679
very often we have just one alternative

434
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
not two not three and

435
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
those people realize that they are the

436
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,919
only

437
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,240
choice and they can dictate their

438
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,559
conditions

439
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
even when we developed a certain

440
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
security requirements that we are going

441
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,720
to customize for different solutions

442
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,200
the companies that are alone in the

443
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
market they are not ready even to

444
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
discuss

445
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,600
those requirements

446
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,919
they say we sold it

447
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,440
so use it

448
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
as on an as is basis it's one of the

449
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,039
problems that we have to do something

450
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,280
about we

451
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,159
usually develop a set of requirements

452
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,919
and when we develop a custom product and

453
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,880
we positioned it that our product is 100

454
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,400
secure we used the secure programming

455
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
tools we

456
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,600
analyzed the we did vulnerability tests

457
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,159
this is a problem now on the one hand we

458
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,840
can continue using foreign solutions

459
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,280
that are not going to be

460
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
renewed

461
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,200
and shift to russian analogs

462
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,320
which are not checked for security at

463
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
all

464
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,320
alexander do you agree to what andre

465
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
said

466
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,039
he was a bit skeptical about

467
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,360
security requirements

468
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,240
and um

469
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,039
matching those requirements

470
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,080
yes the problem exists

471
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
because

472
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,640
we have to find for replacement the

473
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
number of attacks grew up

474
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,039
and it's we need secure products

475
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,679
russian cq russian products have

476
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
problems with that

477
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
of course functionality is there they

478
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,440
can do the job but if security is one of

479
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
the top

480
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
requirements so it's very difficult to

481
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
satisfy that requirement

482
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,960
we check our products such products and

483
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
our experts said

484
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,919
that

485
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,520
we didn't see a less secure

486
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
product

487
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,919
before

488
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
i tell them you didn't see all the

489
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,400
russian products maybe you will see a

490
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,799
worse product

491
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
in future

492
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,840
but after we find vulnerabilities if

493
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,640
there are some critical vulnerabilities

494
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,159
we return the product to the vendor

495
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
many of them

496
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,280
close the vulnerabilities and ask us to

497
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
reshape it of course it is if it is not

498
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
related to architecture for example the

499
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
second factor is not supported and the

500
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
vendor doesn't want to close that

501
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,120
responsibility uh vulnerability

502
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,360
why does russian software so weak

503
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,039
what is the reason

504
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
if

505
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,960
we

506
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
do have a good

507
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
this

508
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,480
area in iit in russia it's security we

509
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
have

510
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,520
more than one two three companies here

511
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
who do it professionally and now i see

512
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,600
that russian products are insecure one

513
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,640
of the colleagues said that

514
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
security requirements were theoretical

515
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
now they are practical

516
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
that is

517
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,679
one of the basic reasons

518
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,559
companies are young products are young

519
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,360
and

520
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,000
requirements are new

521
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,720
we

522
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,039
they didn't see any such requirements

523
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,039
before because

524
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,720
our products internal products runs

525
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
through pin

526
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,240
other tests don't do that

527
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
i think it's a complex story it will be

528
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,720
changed we try to help our vendors

529
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,960
we have even solutions

530
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,679
that help pro to make better products

531
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,400
instead of paying for the license we

532
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,720
offer a service saying that for a

533
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
certain time we are going to audit your

534
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,320
product install a solution that will

535
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
make your product more secure it will

536
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,159
tell you about your vulnerabilities

537
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,039
usually

538
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
we take

539
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
money for that but

540
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,279
we can

541
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,799
offer such services on a barter basis

542
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,120
what about you what about russian

543
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,760
analogs what were the difficulties what

544
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,720
were the

545
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
good things

546
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,080
well for security it was easy

547
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,080
because

548
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,279
we

549
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,960
held

550
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
multi-led

551
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
security so it was just required for us

552
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,120
to make uh one uh circuit purely russian

553
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,080
so

554
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,960
uh

555
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
gave us no pain

556
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
but how we

557
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,840
were selecting i'll be frank in terms of

558
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
how hardware it was just

559
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
whatever was available because when it

560
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
became

561
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,720
clear

562
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,320
that the situation

563
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
was only going to exacerbate

564
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
in terms of hardware

565
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,120
so the

566
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,080
uh most important thing uh was to go as

567
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
fast as possible to create some

568
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,159
new stock

569
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,720
for specific software it's uh

570
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,840
everything's very easy we have a lot of

571
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
expertise running such systems

572
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
so we were selecting everything that was

573
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,400
a close match

574
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,679
and

575
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
developers are actually much more

576
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,559
flexible they're prepared it's just they

577
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
hadn't had a market like that before

578
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,039
because all a large business was focused

579
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,679
on the western products because the

580
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
wheel has

581
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,799
been

582
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,960
the bicycle has already been invented

583
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,760
and a way to do it again but now we're

584
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
going through all this way we're

585
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
together with these companies

586
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,480
well maybe uh it's uh not a long time uh

587
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,440
that it has happened but we you've

588
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
already felt uh some dynamic

589
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,200
uh

590
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
in terms of attitude to you from russian

591
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,880
customers are you prepared to uh go your

592
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
half of the way in price

593
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,640
well for prices no but for flexibility

594
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
well the important thing

595
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
moistness is that the capacity

596
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,799
the development resources

597
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
are

598
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,760
in short supply

599
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,600
so one has to keep up with what you

600
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,919
haven't had for 10 years in three months

601
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,240
and unfortunately there are no miracles

602
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,159
of that kind

603
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,200
oleg you mentioned this but it's also

604
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,039
common knowledge

605
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,480
your company

606
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,440
has been

607
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
doing

608
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,080
import substitution for a long time

609
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
so there are companies

610
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,039
that

611
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,559
only

612
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
got to grips with it this year how far

613
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,679
away have you moved on the way uh to

614
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
install russian uh similar products

615
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,039
what's missing yet

616
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,640
look in terms of software some dry facts

617
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,000
i've already mentioned more than 23 000

618
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,799
work stations

619
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,000
iran uh russian operating system astro

620
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
linux

621
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
about 68

622
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
67 68

623
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,600
of all the workstations

624
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,520
we

625
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
adopted

626
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,039
back in 2020

627
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,399
a concept of

628
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,520
import substitution and so all the new

629
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
solutions

630
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,880
were have been purchased since then

631
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,000
in terms of software being

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,679
substituted

633
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,600
what's a concern to me

634
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
that we don't really have a heavy duty

635
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,520
erp system in the country that's as we

636
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,640
say a medical fact

637
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,520
same thing or something close

638
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,559
to that

639
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,120
so there's no heavy duty

640
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,799
em

641
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,799
so

642
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
these two

643
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,360
subjects to be addressed at the federal

644
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,399
level

645
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,000
in terms of hardware

646
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
of course uh it's already made mention

647
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,919
here it's telecom it's going to cover us

648
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,279
all very soon

649
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,880
i mean heavy duty telecom

650
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
but in terms of

651
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
i don't want to dramatize

652
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,120
but for your understanding

653
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,760
you have to understand that the x-86

654
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,640
architecture is soon going to become

655
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,520
completely unavailable well i understand

656
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,320
that

657
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
we can do grey imports but the whole

658
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,679
country may not survive

659
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,559
based on great imports of the x86

660
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,120
architecture we've already tested

661
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,760
arm-based workstation the technology of

662
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
the cpu is by car

663
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,840
well there are

664
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,559
problems

665
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,120
with the cpu yeah and by the way the cpu

666
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
is quite good

667
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
the benchmarks i say is good

668
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,880
there are problems

669
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,600
so going from the cpu to the machine

670
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,480
there are

671
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,320
quite a lot of

672
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,840
items underway

673
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,679
and apart from the fact that the

674
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,880
motherboard has also to be modified to

675
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,919
fit

676
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,200
the cpu we don't have memory chips we

677
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,440
don't have hard drives

678
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,880
well craft way

679
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,679
whether it's just small parts then their

680
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,840
operating system the operating systems

681
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,279
are there they're good astra linux

682
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,360
runs okay but for application software

683
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,440
it's not available

684
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
and this

685
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,600
is exactly uh what needs to be addressed

686
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
in the first place which we have started

687
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,240
too

688
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,960
i had a similar problem in 2020

689
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,360
when we were migrating to astro linux

690
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,799
and

691
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,600
there was no software for astro linux

692
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,519
now we've turned around and i'm hoping

693
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,480
that

694
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,279
the

695
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,720
same turnaround will happen either with

696
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
regard to the arm architecture or race

697
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,200
5.

698
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
not only the

699
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,039
level of attacks has changed in your

700
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,480
work not only the situation with

701
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,760
technologies

702
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,039
but also the relationships within the

703
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
business have changed so i'd like to ask

704
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
alexander

705
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,840
over the past

706
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,720
few months has it become easier to talk

707
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
about information security with business

708
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,320
about its importance

709
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,640
about the need

710
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
to implement

711
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,399
uh better and more powerful solutions

712
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,120
look we've never had problems about this

713
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,799
we have our own approach ib 2.0

714
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,559
which means

715
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,919
which says that the ceo

716
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,039
is

717
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,640
the ultimate responsible person for

718
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,559
security if

719
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,279
some money stolen from the financial

720
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,279
director's account cfo's accounts it's

721
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,760
not a security services problem it's

722
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
cfo's problem

723
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,799
and

724
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,799
to help them solve this problem there

725
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,240
are partners

726
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
and suppliers uh who make sure that it

727
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,440
doesn't happen i see has certainly has

728
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
become more important

729
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,200
the risks uh because the risks of that

730
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,519
have emerged are about

731
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,120
business disruption

732
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,000
so in this sense yes uh the attention

733
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,159
from business has grown up

734
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,960
and the preparation for events that

735
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
concern business

736
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,880
uh has also become

737
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,840
uh important as to the interaction with

738
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,480
information security uh well

739
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,120
nothing's changed

740
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,480
we always

741
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,640
check what we have depending on

742
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,039
regardless of what we have inside we run

743
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,519
external pen tests with motivated people

744
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,919
and if we have any problems they are

745
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,440
immediately exposed

746
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
okay are you prepared

747
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,799
to share

748
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,720
at which a level

749
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,760
uh the

750
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,080
uh critical solutions about information

751
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,480
security are taken in your company and

752
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,559
has it become to make these decisions

753
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,760
recently

754
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,480
let me repeat myself all these changes

755
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120
did not happen recently

756
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,519
they happened in

757
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,000
2017

758
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,799
where all these petya and misha

759
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,679
things arrived they also

760
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,000
affected us so we ran an audit at that

761
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,399
time we chose a strategy we implemented

762
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,360
some projects it took us several years

763
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,600
and

764
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,519
that needed to be instituted in terms of

765
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,799
uh management communication and security

766
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,360
we've done all that so over the past two

767
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,919
or three years we've been just uh

768
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,679
fine-tuning what we had already had

769
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,599
and what happened on the 24th of

770
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,839
february and after that so largely

771
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,839
speaking it uh hasn't

772
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,239
made us change anything in this

773
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,000
schematic everything happened earlier

774
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,799
andre

775
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,918
your company is quite young perhaps

776
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,960
you've already started some projects

777
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,320
so do you feel a change in the attitudes

778
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,800
towards uh security in the company

779
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,040
well there are several

780
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,719
points here

781
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,719
several directions

782
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,960
such as when we started to get localized

783
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,639
of course

784
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,079
business i.t and security all tried to

785
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,680
address their own

786
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,200
objectives

787
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,880
and those who

788
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
organized these pro this process they

789
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,119
were trying to achieve some synergy but

790
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,560
one way or the other

791
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,480
business uh tried to make it so that the

792
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,040
services uh that they needed for work

793
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
should be launched first i t we're

794
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,720
trying uh to

795
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,240
do the same for business but also to

796
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,800
make sure uh that it runs smoothly and

797
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,160
we from security we're trying

798
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,680
to make it all

799
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,440
uh secure or even though a short lag of

800
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,359
time was needed

801
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,599
but of course the cyber culture level in

802
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,440
our company was quite high there were

803
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,880
moments when business was coming to us

804
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
with questions for instance they started

805
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
a certain service about employer

806
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
personal data so they started asking how

807
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,599
safe it was

808
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,400
so they were acting proactively and it

809
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
resulted in a constructed constructive

810
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,359
dialogue

811
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,960
but nevertheless

812
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
one has to understand

813
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
that's every function

814
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
in crisis time

815
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,280
is

816
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,000
solving its own problems and sometimes

817
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
it doesn't think at all about the goals

818
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,359
and objectives of the guy next door so

819
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,280
quite often so what's what was very

820
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
important for us is that the top manager

821
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,000
who created the working groups himself

822
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,359
uh took part in the work of these

823
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,640
working groups

824
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,839
uh overseeing certain lines of business

825
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,240
and in a certain sense it allowed us to

826
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,800
achieve a balance between the speed and

827
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
the liability

828
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
and safety

829
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,640
they said

830
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
there is also an opinion

831
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,280
that roughly there are two types of

832
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,119
companies the companies that have

833
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,200
already been attacked so that they have

834
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
real-life experience uh in that and

835
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,960
companies that have not yet been

836
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,320
attacked so uh who are not uh yet

837
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,079
exposed

838
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,880
so the second type of companies are of

839
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,520
course uh more inert

840
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,240
they

841
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,359
perhaps

842
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,240
are waiting uh for a large incidence to

843
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,599
happen to them and it's more difficult

844
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
to push your

845
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
security concept

846
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,599
in their business

847
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,320
but in the first type of companies

848
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,200
those who have already failed

849
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,960
the brunt of

850
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
the

851
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,920
uh

852
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,400
attacks

853
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,359
on their business on their money

854
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,880
so in those cases

855
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,160
the management

856
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,839
is also

857
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,640
also has a vested interest in motivating

858
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,440
everyone

859
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,359
i would just like to add

860
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,599
that for companies of the same type it

861
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,800
would be extremely useful to order pen

862
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,440
testing services because i've already

863
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
known i already know quite a lot of

864
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
colleagues who say we find

865
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,520
our systems are protected it's difficult

866
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,839
to hack us it's an illusion that can

867
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,800
easily be broken when you get reports

868
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,680
from motivated white hats and pen

869
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
testers

870
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,839
who

871
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,240
got inside the system get the may the

872
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
main administration authority and can do

873
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
after that uh whatever they want after

874
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,280
that uh talking to people who've

875
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,359
experienced this

876
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,400
themselves

877
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
is much easier it's much easier so

878
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
they're uh more

879
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,599
prone to change their processes

880
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,599
colleagues i only have time for one uh

881
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,079
brief question and i'll ask each one of

882
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,000
you what have you learned over the past

883
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
three months both personally as a

884
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
professional and your structure your

885
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
organization

886
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,359
the business

887
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,880
where you work

888
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,040
in the first place of course in terms of

889
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
safety

890
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,440
let's start with you

891
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,640
i guess that's it

892
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,480
because on the whole

893
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,640
again safety first

894
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
so we uh

895
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,240
had been

896
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,440
preparing and we've also analyzed our

897
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,320
work

898
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,720
from the security perspective

899
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,119
so you just need to become

900
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,960
and

901
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
in certain cases

902
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,800
to be with the team

903
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,920
to spend more time with the team

904
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,400
this is not an easy time to do that

905
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,400
sergio

906
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,480
i will support my colleague

907
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,400
i uh

908
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,200
in

909
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
his saying that people are the most

910
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,240
important thing

911
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,520
and perhaps

912
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,400
as

913
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,040
a leader

914
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,880
you know they started to go uh very fast

915
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,079
through all these stages

916
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,359
up until the commissioning

917
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,079
acceptance actually you know denial uh

918
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,200
bargaining and then acceptance

919
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,680
acceptance regarding any question well

920
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
there are certain things there are no

921
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,480
way for us to affect

922
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,520
so the

923
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,920
faster we get to the acceptance phase

924
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,480
the faster i will get restructured so

925
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
this work under heavy

926
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,000
uh loads

927
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
that has grown

928
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
uh in terms of the number of attacks

929
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,880
happening or more

930
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,560
uh frequently has it added skills to you

931
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,680
it's

932
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,960
uh skills of prioritization i would put

933
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,280
it this way well so far i don't know

934
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,200
so far we haven't seen uh some super

935
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,680
techniques

936
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,359
uh well people are trying uh to uh you

937
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,319
know win by numbers rather than quality

938
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,560
okay thank you alexander maybe communist

939
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,240
invited appeared a bit earlier uh we've

940
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,200
tested this all on ourselves and when it

941
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,400
became clear that the shutting down of

942
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
western services is not going to shut

943
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,079
down the operation

944
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
that was very important

945
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
an important story is about the

946
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,400
autonomous russian internet we ran an

947
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,440
exercise

948
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
in february

949
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
and it turned out

950
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
that there were some problems in the

951
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,640
infrastructure for instance

952
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,240
the dns

953
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,920
not the right dns was used in certain

954
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,880
systems

955
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,440
well perhaps

956
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,839
providers

957
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,640
did quite a good job of using the dns

958
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,280
systems and second was certification

959
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,200
certificates because

960
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
uh in russia there are no certificates

961
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,599
that could be

962
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,000
perceived

963
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,359
taken account of uh by all the

964
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,200
but things are

965
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,319
evolving

966
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,640
russian certificates have appeared and i

967
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,400
think uh the main risks have been

968
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,280
removed and the exercises has shown that

969
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
the company is working it's can function

970
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
uh without access to foreign ip

971
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,800
addresses at all

972
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,960
no

973
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,520
i'll say that the accents has shifted a

974
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,400
bit

975
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,800
the focus has shifted

976
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
i.t

977
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,359
management

978
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,599
also takes a role

979
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,280
of education

980
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
educational

981
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,079
activities

982
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,640
becoming a tutor

983
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
for other employees but now what's

984
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,599
important is the time

985
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,839
so perhaps

986
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,720
uh rather than focusing on the speed of

987
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,640
making certain action to think about

988
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,520
what

989
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,839
measures has to be taken and this

990
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,720
applies to all sorts of employees

991
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,200
from the shop floor to the top

992
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,359
leadership

993
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,520
we understand this but not everybody

994
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,160
does and people are just afraid to ask

995
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,359
so this is why it's so important andre

996
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,960
the company that's still called

997
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,480
accenture but that has already become a

998
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,400
russian company has

999
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
it had the time to acquire new skills

1000
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,160
and new experience to start doing

1001
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,760
something

1002
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,680
over the past three months

1003
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,400
well the most important thing

1004
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,079
that i would derive from the past three

1005
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,640
months is the flexibility

1006
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,520
and

1007
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,119
the capability uh to adjust to new

1008
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,040
conditions very fast

1009
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,480
initially myself and my team have been

1010
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,599
dealing with customer services

1011
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
and so we come to our customers and try

1012
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,359
to organize information security are

1013
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,000
they separately or as part of more

1014
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,079
comprehensive projects iq projects i

1015
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,599
mean

1016
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,040
and when

1017
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,119
we had

1018
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,599
to disconnect from the global company

1019
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,680
it's quite natural that

1020
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,800
in russia we had a small team and we

1021
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,319
practically

1022
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,400
did not have our own information

1023
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,839
security and myself in particular had to

1024
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,599
combine their roles

1025
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,839
of not the cis in my understanding the

1026
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,040
cis is a person uh who's doing uh

1027
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,000
management of this in an operational

1028
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,640
kind of way but a person uh who builds

1029
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
the internal security same applied to my

1030
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,760
team uh it appeared that the consultants

1031
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,520
who would come to our customers

1032
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,920
explaining them how to build information

1033
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,720
security correctly they started to build

1034
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,880
it

1035
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,119
their own resources

1036
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,760
it was a serious test for them a test

1037
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,680
for their experience and knowledge

1038
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,960
whether

1039
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,560
they were saying the right things to all

1040
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,000
the customers and here what helped us uh

1041
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,960
was

1042
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,079
the exposure of our consultants to all

1043
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,680
the different projects

1044
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,760
that they gained over the uh over a few

1045
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,079
years

1046
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,040
and

1047
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,319
this

1048
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,640
exposure allowed us

1049
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,119
rather to reflect on what needs to be

1050
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,599
done now but uh to implement some

1051
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,200
specific things

1052
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,599
and another point

1053
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,359
we as consultants

1054
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,920
have also always been focused on

1055
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,560
building processes

1056
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,280
and

1057
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,960
secondly on the automation of these

1058
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,200
processes uh using security information

1059
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,440
security tools and when we understood

1060
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,040
that when you start focus with smoke

1061
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,440
focusing the process you understand that

1062
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,079
the primary thing is to build this

1063
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,079
process and then

1064
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,000
to

1065
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,319
take in automation

1066
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,800
but it can also only be done

1067
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,960
if you've already covered the previous

1068
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,480
step thank you

1070

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,800
