1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,559
what is this

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,080
vulnerability it's an rce in windows

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,520
found in internet explorer

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,359
usually used in phishing

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,640
used by office documents

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,359
it employs activix

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,080
the framework

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,519
which

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
on which the

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,640
internet explorer is based and it has an

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
8.8 score

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,680
is it

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,719
really important the patch was in about

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,640
a month

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,920
it was issued

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
pretty much everyone heard about

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
phishing

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,000
and they're all trained of course

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but the users are usually ignoring

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
windows updates

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,520
i'm pretty sure this hall has people who

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,039
have not

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,120
installed the updates

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,519
and microsoft patch is

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,600
a very narrow

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,840
thing it closes just one of the ways of

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,880
the exploit usage but not the whole

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,119
vulnerability

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,680
the vulnerability was exploited even

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,159
after it was packed into

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,200
an rar archive

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
so

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
mail is still the predominant factor of

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,759
malware

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,079
and positive technology statistics shows

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,759
that 55

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,880
of distribution is email

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,119
which is important good good numbers

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,360
right

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
we had an example with

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,079
phishing

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,520
being run by

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,560
one customer saying that everything is

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,479
protected all the

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,719
users are trained

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,399
and

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
here's how the file looked

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,360
it was archived and uh

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,280
it said instruction.pdf

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
and we substituted the sender

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,280
and

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
we had a very very strange text

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
but pretty much everyone

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,480
has launched the file

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
and i had my own research on the

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
vulnerabilities

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
with the question of what do you need to

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
follow vulnerability to to exist just

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,239
21st of september update not to be

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
installed and activex to be

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
activated it's roughly 30 percent

62
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,720
by the show of hands

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
who knows whether your infrastructure

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
has activex

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
allowed enabled or not

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
who is sure that 80 or 90 of your pcs

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
have the latest updates one hand

68
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,800
two hands

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,200
so here's an example of the letter

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,360
two dogs

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
not very

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
strange two of them have the image both

73
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,080
of them have an image but it's not

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,040
an

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
ordinary image it's rendered through

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
activix and is our trigger

77
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,239
let's look at the attack chain

78
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,480
it's quite simple the user receives an

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,080
email

80
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
opens it

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,920
there's the call to an external server

82
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,480
the file is being downloaded

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
and then it's run in a dll

84
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
the patches for this vulnerability have

85
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
been

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,159
issued on the 21st of september but

87
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,239
asian

88
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,080
high level officials were attacked in

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
about a month

90
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
it differs

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
this one looks the same

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
but

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,679
it's it's a little bit different

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,120
so here is the structure

95
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,960
there was an xls file with an xml file

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
it uses custom ui unload to

97
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
upload another file from an external

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
server and this xlx file has our

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,919
vulnerability running

100
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,120
this way

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
allows us to

102
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
avoid

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
some avs some scanning systems without

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
detection

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
here's a dll file structure

106
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
and this vulnerability is used as an

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,080
uploader downloader for

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
the other

109
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,639
encrypters

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
infosteelers and other

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
but how do you protect the users against

112
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
it

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
so first of all is of course updating

114
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
your software

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
even though currently it's not very

116
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
simple thing to do but this is a basic

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,199
thing and this needs to be done

118
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,680
turning activex off

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
it's easy to do

120
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
you need to apply group policy or

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
edit the registry

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,120
use the protection methods

123
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,560
for the mail and

124
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,440
mail attachments

125
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
you can use

126
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
sandboxes they are not new they exist

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
you should also prohibit office

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
applications from creating the child

129
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
processes

130
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,919
which is something that protects from

131
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
a whole family of

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
such things

133
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,479
phishing training

134
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
and

135
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,039
using

136
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
sim systems

137
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,479
pretty much every big business has

138
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
cm but not

139
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,960
many companies run

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
the

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
fishing training

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
exercises

143
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
you might ask why do we need to run them

144
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
if if they don't work

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
well let me explain

146
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,919
imagine we have 20

147
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,560
users opening our documents but without

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
the exercise that would be

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
100 200 of them so

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,759
phishing training

151
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
does not

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,840
stop the openings but it reduces the

153
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
amount of openings and you know

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,319
among 20 users maybe all 20 will be just

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
300 users

156
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,800
and the other 80 might have admins you

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
know

158
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,639
traffic control whitelists proxies

159
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,880
things that will

160
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,680
you know

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
prohibit the this server from

162
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
calling this uh

163
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,039
the cnc

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,400
so why do you

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
do this report you might ask about this

166
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
vulnerability

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
only in april we had two vulnerabilities

168
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
two

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
exploits public exploits on this

170
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
uh on for phishing

171
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,639
and

172
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
you need to remember that 50

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
of malware is spread using email so we

174
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,520
need to drop this percentage we need to

175
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
somehow remove

176
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
the possibility for

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
the

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,160
actors to get into the company

179
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,160
and this might be a way of protection

180
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,199
changing

181
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,759
the software that you know and updating

182
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
the software to close the vulnerability

183
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,720
might

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
actually protect you from other types of

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
attacks and vulnerabilities with that

186
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
i'm pretty much through here is a qr

187
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,639
code for all the links and the documents

188
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,240
that might help thank you

189
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,599
are there any questions

190
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
please yeah turn the qr code back thanks

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
for the presentation you had a slide

192
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
with uh as i am

193
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
i mentioned

194
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,279
so

195
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
would you elaborate on this

196
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,440
well how does the exploit work with this

197
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
attack

198
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,958
if you see the

199
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,839
exploit calling an external server and

200
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
downloading an external file the person

201
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
responsible for cm would

202
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
ask why

203
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
do they download this app file from an

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,800
external server

205
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,080
if you

206
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,519
heard about them

207
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,320
you know that they are not very frequent

208
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
type of files to download

209
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
you have some

210
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
events and triggers in the cm system

211
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,360
that

212
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,600
you can choose the signatures and

213
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
triggers that will help you actually

214
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
avoid those events thank you

215
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
and one more question

216
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
regarding the statistics

217
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
55

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
is spread using

219
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
email

220
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,320
but

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
we have a lot of vectors for attacks

222
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,680
so if the admins and security people

223
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,439
have forgot to do their homework

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
to you know do the updates but can we

225
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
gather the statistics for the companies

226
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
where the updates are there the

227
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
antivirus out there and the group policy

228
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
is applied to

229
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
stop opening all the exempt files and

230
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,680
stuff like this

231
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,560
so what will then be

232
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
the success rate for such attacks

233
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
i can answer this question right now

234
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,680
let's

235
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,359
see how this vulnerability works

236
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
first of all if we have a file being

237
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,440
sent through email

238
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,800
it will be of course cut

239
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
through

240
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
by the sandbox

241
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
but there are ways to avoid them

242
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,399
and

243
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
you can also stop the office from

244
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
creating the child process so this will

245
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,360
reduce that percentage even more traffic

246
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,399
control

247
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,760
updates

248
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
yeah the patch is

249
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,560
very narrow at least it will protect you

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,440
from

251
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
some of your levels

252
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,279
so

253
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,040
executing

254
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
exact files and scripts from attachments

255
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
is uh

256
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
extremely

257
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,000
bad it should be prohibited by the group

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
policy

259
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
yeah but uh i think it will kill like 50

260
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
or 60 percent of

261
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,880
that attack

262
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
they don't pay enough attention to

263
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,959
such things right yes

264
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,519
just choose a folder to run the

265
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
executables

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
wherever the office has put this file

267
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
you just cannot run this well regarding

268
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
the homework you are correct but

269
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,640
statistics is still right

270
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
everyone would forget about fishing

271
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,519
if everyone would be

272
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
doing those basic steps

273
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
but the main way of

274
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
going into the enterprise is fishing

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
it's not like zero day exchange

276
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,519
vulnerabilities monitoring

277
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,800
fishing is still still super easy and

278
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
social engineering is alive thus

279
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
everyone understands it

280
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
and you know regarding regardless of the

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,920
amount of training you give

282
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
it can it cannot be killed but you can

283
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,800
reduce its its effects right yes

284
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,120
doesn't a stage help to

285
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
uh you know

286
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,360
stress the employees

287
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
against fishing

288
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,160
there's

289
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
there's a number of tools anti-phishing

290
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
software solutions

291
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,120
positive has their own sandbox

292
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,600
and so on

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,800
okay

294
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,480
but the main vector is still people if

295
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
we

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
don't train people

297
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
we will not succeed

298
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,279
if the admin has done all his homework

299
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,519
with all the group policies and updates

300
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,880
and cm

301
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,839
the people are still there

302
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,040
and

303
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
if it is a

304
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,800
governmental

305
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
enterprise then at least you can limit

306
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
them to doing this or that

307
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
but you need to work with people

308
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
there are services available

309
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,480
you just need to wish you need to have

310
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
the desire

311
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,800
well i think it's super important for

312
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
the top officials to be

313
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
willing to

314
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,600
do so

315
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
to train their people

316
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
doesn't a stage do

317
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,480
the same

318
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
fishing i don't i don't know how to how

319
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,959
do we call this you just keep training

320
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,079
your own

321
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
people about this

322
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
i i

323
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
also

324
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,959
monitor the statistics they did not do

325
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,880
anything decent in this

326
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
in this area

327
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,120
thank you thank you indeed

328
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,839
your

329
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,639
attitude your opinion

330
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
on the vendor updates after the 24th of

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,240
february you would like my

332
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,399
my personal opinion

333
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,880
i think this topic is overinflated

334
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,519
there was a topic on you know malware in

335
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,240
the open source

336
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,040
and

337
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,680
i'd like to tell you that

338
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
open source was

339
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
you know people were

340
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,519
named

341
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
malware actors

342
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
even if they were just including some

343
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,440
some lines in their code

344
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,240
maybe it's applicable for big businesses

345
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
and for critical infrastructure but for

346
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
ordinary business

347
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,519
will the enterprise companies add

348
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
something terrible to their

349
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
software

350
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
maybe for some things you know only

351
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,959
russia specific

352
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,800
but you know being in

353
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,479
windows being microsoft

354
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,160
will it go that way i don't know

355
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
do they issue updates still

356
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
yeah so far

357
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,759
but that's an open question

358
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,480
no i haven't seen anything

359
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
you know regarding

360
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
that it's being turned off

361
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,639
but that's a question of taking risks

362
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,360
and trusting the vendor

363
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
the question was not

364
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,570
asked to the microphone but

365
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,920
[Music]

366
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
of the comment

367
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,639
but the person has

368
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,160
declined

369
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,240
the option to to say to the mike

370
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,600
it is a question of taking risks in the

371
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
organization

372
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
if you take av solutions

373
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,519
what is

374
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,920
guaranteeing you that you know tomorrow

375
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
after an update it does not start you

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
know blocking files uh

377
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
you know doing

378
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
wrong wrong things you create just

379
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,040
create a test environment you accept the

380
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,720
risks for all the uh security systems

381
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
and then you test

382
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,959
and then you look at with some you know

383
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,518
time gap

384
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,359
how long does my av work if it works

385
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,520
fine with your test group then you

386
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,559
spread it all over the organization

387
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,400
yeah you're right there's the solution

388
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
test it before you deploy it

389
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,160
you you either you either take those

390
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,119
risks or you don't you can turn off your

391
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,360
av and look at you know

392
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,840
take the other type of risks or you can

393
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,199
migrate to astral linux

394
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,679
will there be updates or not

395
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,320
we never know

396
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
if there are no questions from the

397
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
audience anymore thank you very much
