1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,960
and i've been doing independent research

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,279
and back bouncy for a long time and i

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,480
love talking about it

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,599
i'm working for a psp now

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,238
and if you're interested please join us

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,800
we do have some interesting uh

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
job opportunities we shall be talking

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,760
about fishing today

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,399
i guess everybody knows about classic

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,360
fishing and in classical fishing

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,680
the attacker will send a link to the

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,640
victim

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
to a fake website it can be done via a

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,480
message

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,079
an email

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,800
promotion on social media

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,959
or

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
so the naive dixon will think that okay

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
design wise it's very similar to the

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,040
sites that they know

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
and the address as well so he won't

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,159
really check the security certificate

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
he will simply follow

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
and all the data

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,119
will go

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
their fishing form there

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
it's a similar scenario but you know

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,880
even the

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
paranoid

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,920
users who will effectively check the

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
digital certificate of the website

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,840
will still be

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
defrauded in this case the user will

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
never be able to distinguish between a

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,360
rail and a phishing page

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
today we are going to discuss

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
how this can be achieved what are the

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,759
typical attacks i get you there and

39
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,280
we'll also discuss

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
several examples from bug bounty and uh

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,480
the recent notorious cases as well

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
so that is like this

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
an attack is uh performed by the hacker

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
and he uploads a phishing form on the

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
official website and the users tend to

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
believe official website so they don't

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
really check us

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
in fact we can

49
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,120
think the same way not just about

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
phishing

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
but also

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
owning a webinar pages or landing pages

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
or

54
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,440
airline booking sites

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
the more horrible the attack will be and

56
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,159
the more people will suffer and let me

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,680
actually tell you of some recent

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,159
examples

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
so

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
somebody hacked

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
a yandex go group on a vegan

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,599
and you know they send links to users

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
giveaways

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
in a different case you know

65
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
with a twitter

66
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,799
where

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
you know as attacks of disgruntled

68
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,760
school kid who has not been able to pass

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
his exams

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
but it could have just been

71
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,840
for example

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
you know

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
failed

74
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,040
where

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
an employee of the unified site exactly

76
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,159
system needs to ensure his or her

77
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,360
credentials

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
and you know if this uh login and

79
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
password is stolen well that's

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
interesting for kids

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
now some people

82
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
lose hundreds of rubles

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,959
on the index others lose millions of

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,880
dollars in btc scams

85
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,919
companies often do not want to

86
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
compensate them for losses and very

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
often they don't even have the

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,240
infrastructure for that

89
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
that's also a problem is that most

90
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,360
attacks they actually seem pretty stupid

91
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
check this out for example you know this

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
giveaway page it looks horrible

93
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,199
nobody has really prepared you know the

94
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,040
audience for that which would be the

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
case for proper giveaways like you know

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,520
in a week we're going to do that please

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,840
register and so on and so forth and

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,799
design-wise it's horrible

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
you know this

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
scams are extremely simplistic and

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
stupid and maybe because of that

102
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
fortunately there are not too many

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
victims

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
now let's discuss the kind of systems

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
that can be hacked and the kind of

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
problems

107
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
this will create

108
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
so you see we have a company and the

109
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
company has a website

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
and

111
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,479
they will probably communicate with

112
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,280
their users using email campaigns and we

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,800
hope that this company has happy clients

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
well the reality is slightly different

115
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
there is a cloud

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
or maybe their internal network there is

117
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
a server there

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,759
then some magic happens

119
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,400
and their clients get messages in social

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
media

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,719
instant messages or emails

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
and in reality it would look like this

123
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,199
and we're not even showing their

124
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
employees or their contractors or

125
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,680
contractors employees or contractors

126
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,759
partners and so on

127
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
so there is this cloud

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,199
sitting in this cloud and numerous

129
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,080
systems running some hardware

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
and they all have their vulnerabilities

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
their internal network

132
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,440
also has its holes and phones

133
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
there is also a separate system for

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
making outbound calls sending messages

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
and emails

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
they're also landing pages

137
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,400
and landing pages are often created

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,919
not by professional programmers

139
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,479
or information cyber security experts

140
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
but rather by marketing people

141
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,680
there is also the tech support group

142
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
where users will want to discuss things

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
that matter to them

144
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
where they may even disclose some

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
sensitive information

146
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
and there are also industrial specific

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,199
services and lots and lots of things

148
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
which i'm not even trying to show in

149
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
this diagram

150
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,800
to you know manage all your

151
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
communications with all sorts of imp

152
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
systems and what have you for whatever

153
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
one dollar a month

154
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,199
which means that potential targets are

155
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,960
very numerous

156
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
any services

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
that are effectively a touch point

158
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
for the user

159
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,639
it could be a site

160
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,360
for example you know a fishing page may

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
be uploaded instead of europe

162
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,479
landing page

163
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,440
or your page on social media can be

164
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,479
hacked

165
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,560
and you can start selling say

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,919
memberships

167
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,039
with a 90 discount and then users will

168
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
be really frustrated

169
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,719
will hate you for a reason

170
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
or for example your messenger

171
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,280
channel maybe

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
owned in order to advertise some ponzi

173
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,520
scheme

174
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
and your clients will be unhappy because

175
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
they will lose their money over it

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
and then you can say well it's no

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
problem for me i wasn't involved but

178
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
does it really matter to them

179
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,279
or about you know they stole your

180
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,880
account on an sms gateway and just sent

181
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,560
a harmless joke to everybody

182
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,000
you don't even have to hack the account

183
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
you will often be able to subscribe to

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,279
their news updates or you can request a

185
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,959
link to an application or a product

186
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,440
and elements of this request will

187
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,080
actually go into the sms and this is how

188
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,880
you can actually send

189
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
something more

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,800
than a regular sms text

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
you can also

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,640
hack a crm system or a ticketing system

193
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,680
the more advanced the hacker is you know

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,080
the more interesting things can

195
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,040
design for example if you can hack your

196
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,160
rivals crm system

197
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
you can actually

198
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
you know

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
send communications to your rivals

200
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
clients that will

201
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
pull them and they will stop using their

202
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
services

203
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
rarely will you see

204
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
direct links to various um

205
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,760
web pages

206
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,839
in sms in text

207
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
most of them are shortened and lots of

208
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
link shorteners

209
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
are very shortly programmed

210
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
last year for example

211
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,760
it was very easy to see an access vector

212
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
and this is how you would uh find it

213
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
very easy

214
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,959
to

215
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,160
hack the account of the person in charge

216
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
of marketing campaigns who would be

217
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,000
using those

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
links shorteners

219
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
that's how you would be able to you know

220
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,839
lead huge traffic of people

221
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,360
targeted by a particular marketing

222
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
campaign to a fraudulent website

223
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,440
there are lots and lots of systems they

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
may have their vulnerabilities

225
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
it's not that all of them have huge

226
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,000
holes in them but there are so many of

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,800
them

228
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,000
this would certainly be holes

229
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
i mean some services will have logical

230
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,519
issues

231
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,560
it will also be difficult for the user

232
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,640
to identify whether a particular page

233
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,160
so many passwords are being leaked now

234
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
including passwords of people

235
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
running those systems

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,079
there was for example this a recently

237
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,560
published vulnerability was about a week

238
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
ago

239
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
a pretty popular european service

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,880
enabled you to get access to somebody

241
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
else's site you know when you substitute

242
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
the password

243
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,680
and fortunately you know it was a geo

244
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,279
rewarded and a backbone in a back

245
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,279
boundary program but you know sometimes

246
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,200
it happens differently

247
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,760
another case of a sub domain takeover

248
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,639
where you can actually link as a free

249
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,240
sub domain to your account so for

250
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
example you have a cloud service for

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
creation of landing pages

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,079
you follow the instructions you create

253
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,880
the domain you create sub domains stand

254
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
here

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,120
change

256
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
the account information

257
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
say two months later

258
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
you forgot to pay for this service your

259
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
account will be blocked

260
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
and then

261
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,079
which is very often the case

262
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,600
the domain will stop uh linking to a

263
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
page because it hasn't been paid for and

264
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,399
it can be relinked

265
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
in the worst possible case you have a

266
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
valid digital certificate associated

267
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,279
with this uh with this page which gives

268
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
the heck a great opportunity for fishing

269
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,639
we forgot about sub domain we have been

270
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,720
using it for 10 years and we realized

271
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,440
it's no longer needed

272
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
or maybe

273
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,279
the employee was responsible for it you

274
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,800
know he resigned and we don't really

275
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
know how many sub domains were there

276
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,639
where maybe the subscription is over

277
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,360
or

278
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
for some reasons this international

279
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
service has decided to delete your

280
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,480
account now somebody else should be able

281
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,399
to link the same page to themselves

282
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
or maybe you've just started using this

283
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
service you've created a domain

284
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
you haven't been able to add enough sub

285
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
domains and they've already been

286
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
hijacked

287
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
and it's happening because these attacks

288
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,839
are very easy to

289
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,800
automate this is

290
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,440
this is very well known a repository of

291
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
a nuclei template and it contains a lot

292
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
of automated checks

293
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
that should enable

294
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,720
better

295
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,040
cyber spotting

296
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,360
that's why many popular russian services

297
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
are not there

298
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
magazine

299
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
a european internet store will very

300
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,519
quickly learn that their sub domain

301
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,839
may be stolen

302
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,519
a russian store made easily

303
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,360
often companies don't

304
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
show much interest in it because you

305
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
know some of them may think there is no

306
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
direct damage to them

307
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,279
i recently

308
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,800
got access to three sub-domains of a

309
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,519
largest russian company

310
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,120
and as part of the bug bounty program

311
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
they paid me

312
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,240
thirteen thousand triples which is less

313
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
than two hundred dollars

314
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,560
which means that you know you can

315
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
actually publish something on the

316
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
website of the largest russian company

317
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,800
it will have valid certificates

318
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
and you know with the amount of money

319
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,399
you will be able to get for it you won't

320
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
even be able to pay for your

321
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,279
participation in page days

322
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
it has been around for a long time we'll

323
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,240
have a lot of services which are not

324
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
very popular or totally outdated

325
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
and they will contain some xss some

326
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
simple issues and there should be ways

327
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,160
of manipulating content there

328
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
they're not even mentioned in the bug

329
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
bounty program because you know say was

330
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
some news uh

331
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
site that was established five years ago

332
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,319
and has not been updated since then

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
but how do the users know this is the

334
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
case

335
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
we may bring the user there with a

336
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,040
phishing campaign

337
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,399
we may tell them

338
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,480
register here get a bonus and they will

339
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,800
think okay it seems credible the address

340
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,959
is seems to be okay why not

341
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,759
there is another issue

342
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,800
that is

343
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,279
external

344
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,639
and again there will be lots of logical

345
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,240
issues there

346
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
particularly

347
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
you know they do some email campaigns or

348
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
sms campaigns you know often you can

349
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
actually

350
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
maybe

351
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,800
or you can do you know exhaustive search

352
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,759
and

353
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,120
effectively

354
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
hijack the site administrator account

355
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
now let's talk about

356
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,360
password leaks and weak passwords this

357
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
is this particular case from the bug

358
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
bounty program the password there was

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
pretty difficult

360
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,400
and the login was not obvious

361
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,520
however the manager of the sms agency

362
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,280
decided to use notion

363
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,119
and you know they inadvertently

364
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,000
published a link to this page so i found

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
it

366
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
i checked that the password was valid

367
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
and this is how i got access to three

368
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,559
sub domains

369
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,399
this you know huge russian corporation

370
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,919
how come we see so many really dumb

371
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,320
clicks

372
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
is that most companies have too much

373
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
data so much data you know they keep

374
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,640
updating passwords

375
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,200
to ever-growing number of servers

376
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
they need to be stored somewhere and

377
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
need to be administered

378
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,080
and

379
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
it may easily happen that you know you

380
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
have huge turnover of employees and

381
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
generating unique passwords for

382
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,760
everybody

383
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,679
is difficult

384
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
how about we just store it all a notion

385
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
many employees don't care about

386
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,960
passwords

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
as long as you know this password do not

388
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,840
really protect them bank accounts

389
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,919
they have negligence

390
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,400
same often happens to contractors who

391
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,880
tend to store their passwords in a weird

392
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,919
way

393
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,840
what's also funny is you know how many

394
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
cloud services are greedy let's consider

395
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
notion which i love so much

396
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,860
for free

397
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,979
[Music]

398
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
will be able to read but not edited

399
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
if you have more people working for you

400
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
you will either need to register a

401
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
professional account so that you should

402
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,000
be able to add editors or make it public

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
people you know prefer to save four

404
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,559
dollars a month or maybe you know they

405
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
cannot really pay dollars right now

406
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
given the sanctions

407
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
so they make the internal documents

408
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
public

409
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
and if you want to make some pages

410
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
particularly you know critical and

411
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
sensitive you will need to pay even more

412
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
so a lot of data gets leaked

413
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,200
it's not clear however

414
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
because you know so many sources really

415
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,559
need to be analyzed i've been doing it

416
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
for a long time and i can give you the

417
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
statistics

418
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
you know for every million

419
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
documents

420
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,120
leaked and analyzed manually roughly 20

421
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,760
000 will be interesting

422
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,640
and roughly 1 000 will contain passwords

423
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,840
and roughly

424
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
100 will contain passwords

425
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,559
to

426
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,640
you know interesting services

427
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
or for you know assets of companies that

428
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,959
offer bug balancing programs

429
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,159
one

430
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,120
roughly

431
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
contains something interesting and one

432
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,799
percent of that contains something

433
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,320
interesting

434
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,439
commercially speaking

435
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
you know very often people don't even

436
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
know where to look for links

437
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
so we have documents and they are saying

438
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
cloud services

439
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,960
but your employee for example

440
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
may publish their login and password in

441
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
a telegram channel don't ask me why they

442
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
did it

443
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
but this is what happened

444
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
this is how you know

445
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,520
somebody made some money in a bug bouncy

446
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
program

447
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,679
from

448
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,039
an email campaign

449
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,400
the services

450
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
of a cloud storage service changes every

451
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,640
day

452
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,159
take for example

453
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,000
this case of the russian company you

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,970
know i just chanced upon it

455
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,480
[Music]

456
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,520
i mean i was uh going through some space

457
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,799
or notion

458
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,480
i found nothing interesting but i forgot

459
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,919
to close it

460
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,360
so i opened the same tab like two months

461
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,240
later

462
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,840
i update it and i

463
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,200
see there are passwords now there you

464
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
know had i just you know checked it and

465
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,120
closed it i would have never found it

466
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
so the big question is are you really

467
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,320
sure that the perpetrators

468
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
do not have access to a cloud system

469
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,320
even if nothing has changed there yet

470
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,679
like it may very well be that you know

471
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,000
i guts you know the password to it

472
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,280
there is nothing critical there

473
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
and you know as a hacker i'm just

474
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
waiting for you to upload something

475
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
interesting

476
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
the problem is that you know you won't

477
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
really get

478
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,039
full-fledged system locks in most

479
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
corporations some companies are running

480
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
system logs but they're not doing it the

481
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
right way

482
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
and it can actually lead to even more

483
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,360
serious issues than a potential hack

484
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,679
for example if you're not so serious

485
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,520
site gets hacked

486
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,240
and then you decided to find

487
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,280
whoever is responsible for the leak

488
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
and you turn to the police

489
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,840
and the police asks for logs

490
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
and inspects the locks

491
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,280
and it turns out that you know an id for

492
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
your employee was not really shown there

493
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,120
properly

494
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,760
for example a secretary or a manager or

495
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
administrator or a manager

496
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,440
no didn't configure their account

497
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,760
properly and you know they may

498
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,360
have to pay pretty dearly for this

499
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,880
even if they were not responsible

500
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,240
in some services you simply cannot force

501
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,159
the users to change their passwords

502
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,000
with some services

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
all you can do is kindly remind the

504
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
users to change their password

505
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
well they will say yes sure maybe they

506
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,520
will add one to their password

507
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,480
and keep it like that

508
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,360
as a white hat

509
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,760
or researcher

510
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
you need to make such an effort to find

511
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,600
the leaks

512
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
oh this is good because this this means

513
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,799
that you know hackers also have a hard

514
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,799
time

515
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,320
unfortunately for us

516
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
not all services are so bad some of them

517
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
actually are well protected

518
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,880
and quite often you will not be able to

519
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,400
steal anything in a single goal

520
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,240
what if a particular email service he's

521
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,279
if indeed a classical sub domain

522
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,480
takeover

523
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,799
you can delete the sub domain

524
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,760
within several days or

525
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,559
hours later

526
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,760
malicious sub domain is a malicious uh

527
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
constant will not be there

528
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,240
now what if it's an emailing campaign

529
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
service

530
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,919
you know if uh

531
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
account gets taken over

532
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,799
no it's effectively being run now

533
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
by

534
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,200
you know they are advertising to your

535
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,360
bonafide client telling you cannot stop

536
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,919
it you turn to the support service

537
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,640
and several days later they may respond

538
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,600
please send in some proof that you

539
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
really own this account somehow we don't

540
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,000
believe it

541
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,880
and if you are not lucky

542
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
and you reside in a country that's

543
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,039
laboring under sanctions

544
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
and for some reason you are

545
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,760
still using a service uh provided by a

546
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,000
company which

547
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
observes all the existing rules to see

548
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,159
chances are they're not even going to

549
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,400
help you

550
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,440
now let's talk not just about users and

551
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,760
clients but also about employees because

552
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
employees obviously are a great target

553
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,559
for fishing

554
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,919
you know your employees will be using

555
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
all sorts of weird services

556
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,880
they like chats for example

557
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
in a large corporation

558
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,440
some of them are still using icq can you

559
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,279
imagine that and they're still using icq

560
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
to communicate with their contractors

561
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
some of the services by the way are used

562
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,799
unofficially

563
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,880
most of the notion pages by the way

564
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,960
i'm

565
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,000
who is tired of storing all data in

566
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
confluence and they want to have a

567
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,880
convenient elegance interface

568
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,960
and

569
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,000
if it's a cyber security employee

570
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,159
probably won't be able to jeep him with

571
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,279
a simple invitation to test you know and

572
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,600
use service out but if it's a courier

573
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
who has been you know is really tired

574
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
after a long time

575
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
and then he is informed

576
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,960
in a chat that has been taken over

577
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,080
if you do not

578
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,799
you know fill out a form explaining why

579
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,880
you're late you will be fined 500

580
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,279
dribbles they will be happy to provide

581
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,760
all the information all their credits

582
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,960
without checking what the site

583
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
so your company may be very serious

584
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
about security

585
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,320
but unofficially employees

586
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
will choose something different for

587
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,480
their convenience

588
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
official systems

589
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,440
will often be as vulnerable as uh

590
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
unofficial systems

591
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
the problem is that you at least know

592
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,880
what the official systems are was

593
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
cloud system is leaked and you don't

594
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
even know it has been in use and maybe

595
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,120
lots and lots of interesting goodies

596
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,559
looking for them on telegram is not

597
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,600
trivial you know because they do have

598
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,960
their own

599
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
ways of uh protecting when you watch the

600
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,000
company against uh brute forcing

601
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
another

602
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,960
so you may want to look for a particular

603
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,880
chart that contains the passwords

604
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,760
at the problem

605
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,000
many trackers and planning systems will

606
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,279
enable you to create tasks simply by

607
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,399
sending letters to them

608
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
that my system is being accessed this is

609
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,640
no fun please do not screw up my working

610
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,559
process as an interpreter thank you very

611
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,159
much

612
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,720
so you can create

613
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,919
tasks and you know that will represent

614
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
how creative you are for example you

615
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,760
know you can ask for access to be

616
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,399
provided to a particular employee

617
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,360
or you know you can send a letter asking

618
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,919
for help in preparing a conference or

619
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,159
something

620
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,200
so this is it you know for

621
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,440
you know knowledge databases and what

622
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
have you

623
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,240
but it can also be

624
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,279
or knowledge management systems very

625
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,039
often you know if you get access to a

626
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,840
particular document

627
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
you will have more than just uh

628
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,360
right

629
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,159
writing uh privileges

630
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,279
and for example what you can do is add a

631
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
fishing link

632
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,960
so this employee for example has always

633
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,679
been using this thing

634
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,000
and he won't really care to double check

635
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,679
yes and the link will take him to the

636
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,760
fishing site

637
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,279
typically

638
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,919
many companies will see will experience

639
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,760
for example if you see that a particular

640
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,679
document has been leaked

641
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,159
and you have deleted it and you were

642
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
hoping that people would uh you know

643
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,559
change the password

644
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,879
but they

645
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
and you know people may still try using

646
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,840
it

647
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,320
or for example a new employee gets hired

648
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,799
he gets access to internal services or

649
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,720
cloud-based services

650
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,039
and they're in plain text

651
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,360
they will be able to see passwords to

652
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,150
all the services

653
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,159
[Music]

654
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,559
now you may say this is horrible and

655
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,880
this is a very

656
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,000
very low probability event but it isn't

657
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,159
or for example give uh

658
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,399
retain some marketing people

659
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,159
and they're using the same account

660
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,519
details for you as well as 50 other

661
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,640
companies

662
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,320
they are working with

663
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,720
and then you know by mistake

664
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
they give

665
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,279
let's play a bingo game

666
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,600
to entertain you a little bit

667
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
you may recognize some of the recent

668
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,000
incidents here

669
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,720
despite everything i've been telling you

670
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
you may have

671
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,919
made the conclusion that third party

672
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,279
services

673
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,399
are buggy

674
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,559
this is not really the case

675
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
you know the times when we could say you

676
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,120
know what an employee has an email and

677
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,919
phone and everything can be hacked and

678
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,080
every hosting every cloud

679
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,919
service provider can be hacked you know

680
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,919
these times are over

681
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,440
we now need to be

682
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,120
much more systemic

683
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,479
because of the sheer amount of data

684
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,880
i should be able to take your questions

685
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,760
now i have delivered my presentation

686
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,240
much faster than i expected so i will be

687
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,679
very happy to hear your questions

688
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,559
in your experience

689
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,279
you know it can actually allow the risk

690
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,600
that an employee of the company will

691
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
actually follow the link i will enter

692
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,000
some details or whatever

693
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
well i don't have uh personal experience

694
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,840
in this respect but uh

695
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,919
some stuff i can share with you

696
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,519
often the problem

697
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,600
is that you know this uh fishing

698
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
fishing classes

699
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,519
tends to

700
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,039
irritate users although they're useful

701
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,440
and use i'm sorry jiren classes like

702
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,679
this they often create

703
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,399
domains that seem to be very different

704
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,799
from the real ones and the attacks i've

705
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,960
been telling you about

706
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
but

707
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,480
they're more advanced because the user

708
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
actually has got no way of checking if

709
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,559
it's a phishing site or not because you

710
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,240
know you can even see the certificate

711
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,399
there

712
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,040
and the number of people who are

713
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,760
actually going to talk to

714
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,679
you know the cyber security department

715
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,399
is actually very limited

716
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,918
so what i'm trying to say is that

717
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,760
against such attacks it's probably not

718
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
going to help

719
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,879
hi i have another question

720
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,280
so we've been talking about regular

721
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,639
fishing

722
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,239
and we've been talking also about you

723
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,079
know more advanced things like uh

724
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,440
email campaigns and what have you done

725
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,280
naturally there are also

726
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,679
two-factor authentication

727
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,359
and other systems and on github

728
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,800
you can find at least two utilities

729
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,239
that should enable reverse fishing

730
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,640
so what can we do about it how do we

731
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,160
make sure that you know our employees

732
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
you need to control what's happening to

733
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,560
the corporate resources

734
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,119
this should enable you

735
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,200
to defend against well at least the

736
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,680
really stupid attacks uh on the website

737
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,359
of the company

738
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,240
and you should also delineate excess and

739
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,960
you know use the minimum privileges rule

740
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,640
because uh sooner or later

741
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
any company

742
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,720
large or small will have the admins

743
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,598
password leaked

744
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
up

745
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,520
authentication yes well you can bypass

746
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,680
it

747
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,480
in my opinion do not really undermine

748
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,119
the trust

749
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,320
website

750
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,920
[Music]

751
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,520
no it's similar to what i was talking

752
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,640
about

753
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,640
um

754
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,240
all the protective mechanisms

755
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
and the users don't really get to check

756
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,720
you know which website they're in so

757
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,560
minimum privileges continuous control

758
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
and uh thinking about what you're going

759
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,480
to do if things break no they should

760
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
still be reliable ways of protecting

761
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,200
yourself uh yes thank you very much for

762
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
this report

763
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
can you share with us you know cases of

764
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,640
the stupidest and the most creative

765
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,040
fishing

766
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,040
so there is this

767
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,440
service associated

768
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,280
for real with some company and it

769
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,760
contain a password to some admin panel

770
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
and a password to some exchange crypto

771
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,520
exchange

772
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,760
so you go there you see seven hundred

773
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,960
dollars

774
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
and it says that you know

775
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,400
you can actually withdraw money

776
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,640
as long as you know above 1 000.

777
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,959
i've

778
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,599
these are the examples i previously

779
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,480
showed because

780
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,119
attackers have got so many opportunities

781
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,240
because they often get access to huge

782
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,640
databases of people to defraud and for

783
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,680
some reason you know they're not doing

784
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,200
anything creative they're just telling

785
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,119
each of these people to give them 300

786
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,359
triples because they badly need it

787
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,640
i'm surprised they're not creative

788
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,839
enough do we have other questions

789
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
hi thank you very much for your report

790
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,960
my name is igor

791
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,280
my question is about passwords

792
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,040
there is this opinion

793
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,920
that if you keep changing your passwords

794
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,320
it doesn't really make things better

795
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,280
because users tend to simplify their

796
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,400
passwords going forward

797
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,880
and they often say

798
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,680
that if you want to

799
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,359
combat it

800
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,119
you should actually compare the

801
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,680
passwords that they are choosing

802
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,160
to the databases of leaked passwords and

803
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
demanded they change them if there is a

804
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,520
match

805
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,800
do you think it's a good idea

806
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,240
thank you very much it's a good question

807
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,440
i think i should answer that in dates

808
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,599
frequent change of passwords does result

809
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,520
in them getting dumber

810
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,599
and indeed there are good services that

811
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,680
help you check if such a password has

812
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,160
been leaked

813
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,599
i think it should be combined with

814
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,520
password change if this particular

815
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,640
password has been indeed compromised

816
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,960
or if the person who had access to it

817
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,000
has resigned and is no longer bounced by

818
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,079
any applications

819
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,160
so the problem may well be that you know

820
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,320
we had a single password it was pretty

821
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
strong

822
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,440
but now 10 people have resigned and we

823
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,839
don't really know who else knows these

824
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,839
passwords

825
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,960
a password check against the databases

826
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,119
of leaked passwords

827
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,200
tends to increase the strength of

828
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,720
passwords you're using because all the

829
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
simple passwords have already been

830
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
leaked so kubernetes one two three four

831
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,000
five will be out of questions

832
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,520
apparently nobody wants to ask questions

833
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,400
so let me hand you the t-shirts
