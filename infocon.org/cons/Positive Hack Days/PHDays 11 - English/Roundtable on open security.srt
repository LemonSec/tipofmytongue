18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
thank you

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,399
colleagues

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,920
our subject is quite interesting because

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
many of you

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
face open source on a regular basis and

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
use different kind of open source

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
software including

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,640
cyber security area some people make

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
their contributions

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
to open source and it's a good

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
subject for raising skills and getting

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
better reputation in the market but

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,119
starting from february 24

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,400
a lot of

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,520
foreign companies who prevailed in the

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
russian market

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,960
in cybersec

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,640
stopped

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,119
their activities here or withdrew from

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
the russian market and many companies

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,400
face a big question mark and

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,200
they

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,759
face a choice

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
some of them

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
about 17

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,479
are ready to wait until the foreign

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,040
companies come back because they

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
invested a lot and they cannot just

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
waste that

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,719
money

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
others say we're going to refocus

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,079
and call on

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,479
middle east israel

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
china south america

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
whoever is ready to help but if we ask

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
them specifically um

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,640
they are on leave sometimes other people

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
don't answer

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,080
it's a difficult subject to discuss and

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
there is one more alternative

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
that using local software

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,160
and

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
the fourth

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,239
alternative

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,680
if you spend

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
the money already and you cannot spend

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,239
as much

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,120
uh

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
for

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
an renewal of

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
alternative

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
we can use open source and question one

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
is for sergei

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
can we use open source to close

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
all the gaps in corporate

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
enterprise cyber security

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,079
technologically and

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
large scale

76
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,040
gaps and territorially distributed

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,519
companies with hundreds of offices

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,519
without centralized management

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
theoretically yes we can but the

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
the answer is how much are you going to

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
spend because open source doesn't mean

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
free soft because if you just use open

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
source

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,879
then you must rely on a certain vendor

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,000
and the vendor solves your problems

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
instead of you

87
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
if you use classical open source if you

88
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,760
download it from git

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
uh

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,640
and start improving it from scratch then

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
you solve all those problems yourself

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,439
and it also costs money building a

93
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,760
large-scale system based on open source

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,439
well requires

95
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,959
good rng resources we have two

96
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,480
representatives of high-tech companies

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
with such resources and who are going

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,358
that way

99
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,339
who do you mean

100
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,720
[Music]

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
yandex and

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
open well

103
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,759
let's start with the oh company taras

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
how did you come to your idea

105
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
what is open source for you it's

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
mainstream for your cyber security

107
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
it's not something proprietary

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,720
actually i would like to

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
continue what sergey said about free

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,560
software

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
the

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
factor of

113
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,800
free for pay

114
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
is not the main

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
idea

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
because free software existed for quite

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
a long time

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
but it doesn't matter we use open source

119
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,039
software

120
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,320
we compare it for pro with proprietary

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
solutions and very often

122
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,639
open source

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
brings you

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
a lot of benefits and those benefits are

125
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,599
not free of charge

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
it's convenient

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
and it is customizable

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
we can always

129
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,919
improve it if we need and this is a very

130
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
big benefit if

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
you need if you have rng resource if you

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
have good

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,199
engineers dmitry anything else yandex

134
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
well yes thank you

135
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,160
i can add a lot of things actually

136
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
to be precise

137
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,440
i represent yandex cloud but yandex

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
was initially focused on

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
local developments

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,639
and

141
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,080
almost

142
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
everything that we have now

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,199
are our own

144
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,919
in-house developments

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
and security solutions

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,919
are either open source or open source

147
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
with our

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
ed owns

149
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,039
we don't see any problems here

150
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,039
the main problem is

151
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,919
availability of high quality developers

152
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
this is the main thing all the rest does

153
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,479
work vladimir

154
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,599
so

155
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,199
as a

156
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,280
regulator

157
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
the company the o company and the y

158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,199
company

159
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,479
two technological giants they can hire

160
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,360
the best talents in the market and they

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
have the rng

162
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
resources that can improve open source

163
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
most of the companies in the russian

164
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,400
market

165
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
do not have such resources i mean

166
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
consumers of

167
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,720
software not

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
vendors

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
how

170
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,159
well can they use open source

171
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,919
i didn't ask that question beforehand

172
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
you sent me some question but this one

173
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
is new

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
it's really new

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,960
the ministry is quite positive about

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,240
open source we believe the more open

177
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
source we have in the country the better

178
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,360
not just external libraries but active

179
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
participation

180
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,759
with local repositories it's a good

181
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
story because it increases our

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
technological independence

183
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
we understand uh

184
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,000
the

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
next thing

186
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
today

187
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,639
absolutely everything in all companies

188
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
big and small

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
in sights and it systems

190
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,919
you have open source everywhere

191
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,000
absolutely apache pythons mysql

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,958
they are there they are everywhere

193
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
somebody asked me

194
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,560
what about cryptography and open source

195
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,240
don't tell anyone about open ssl because

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,360
it's open source and it's almost

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
everywhere in encryption

198
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,600
so we all have to

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,560
use open source we have a lot of open

200
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
source everywhere do we have to develop

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,279
it yes of course

202
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,160
can

203
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,079
small companies hire developers no

204
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
we need a local russian-based community

205
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
open source was produced by a community

206
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
was born by community but i am a

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
representative of government agencies

208
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
and i cannot

209
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,279
go there and build government-based open

210
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
source that would be a wrong thing to do

211
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
i say

212
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
alternatively that we are ready to

213
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
support

214
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
open source how can government support

215
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,279
open source

216
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
thank you dennis

217
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
what about positive technologies

218
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
you develop your proprietary products

219
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,320
but maybe you also use

220
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
some open source components

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
what about open source for you is it a

222
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,519
competitor

223
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
or an opportunity

224
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
uh to push part of the problems to the

225
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,120
open source community

226
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,560
i would say that open source is not free

227
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
of course

228
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,120
different form factor

229
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,000
it may be free but support is not free

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,760
never free

231
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,560
and

232
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
positive technologies can build the same

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,040
kind of product and distribute it and

234
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
sell support services

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,200
we're

236
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
geopoliticized

237
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,120
now and if we look beyond russia

238
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
it

239
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
wouldn't be

240
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,760
easy

241
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
to

242
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,959
sell anything

243
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
openness

244
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
is about

245
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,440
our technologies

246
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
we can demonstrate it and say

247
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
it works

248
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
and

249
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,959
we can improve it better than you if you

250
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,359
take it

251
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,279
do you mean that positive is going to

252
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,040
open your codes no don't be so fast

253
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
that would be too early good question

254
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
we have plans

255
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,839
to open parts of our

256
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,760
products because we need community

257
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
community must be formed around

258
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,160
something that must be can be

259
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
contributed to

260
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,480
it's difficult to contribute to

261
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,160
proprietary products

262
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
there are two points one is

263
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,160
infrastructure delivery and second is

264
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,560
knowledge if you look at all products

265
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
you can have

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,519
one or the other but not the two things

267
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,560
together

268
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,320
for very clever people an open engine

269
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,279
with a capability to contribute is

270
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,680
something that the community community

271
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
can be formed around

272
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
as for the enterprise sector it's

273
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
another question because the company

274
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,160
especially big company can do it

275
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,639
on its own

276
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,310
whether to

277
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,680
[Music]

278
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,959
develop

279
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
their own product or to buy a ready-made

280
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,120
box solution

281
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
they can develop

282
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
yeah smaller company can buy a box

283
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,399
product because they don't have the

284
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,600
resources to develop

285
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
well

286
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,120
positive can

287
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
open some technologies to get community

288
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,519
with their knowledge we can which can be

289
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,560
shared and sell

290
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,680
on a wider scale than before

291
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,600
thank you good question actually

292
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,079
positive technologies said they are

293
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
ready to open

294
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,279
their codes and one year later we're

295
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,079
going to ask him what

296
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,440
have you closed in the previous year

297
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,760
uh what can you

298
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
open your forks that you built on the

299
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
basis of the open source can you open it

300
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,760
for community like google

301
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
like facebook nate netflix and other

302
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
companies who are actively publishing in

303
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,600
community their own security tools that

304
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
some people use others don't but are you

305
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
ready taras

306
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,959
actually we're not only ready we're

307
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,240
already doing it now

308
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
at coda social hosting we have the area

309
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
where we published interesting products

310
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
and technologies that were born in our

311
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
company in

312
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,839
and something which can be useful

313
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
and beneficial is already published

314
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,720
including security solutions

315
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
we use open source solutions in the

316
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
company

317
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
and

318
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
we develop tools

319
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,360
and

320
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
open it to the open source community we

321
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
take from open source and we contribute

322
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,760
to open source

323
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
and we

324
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,839
increase the total number of open source

325
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
solutions in which areas did you

326
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,279
published your tools security

327
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,600
in the recent years

328
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
well

329
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
an important subject

330
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,560
is supplying chain attacks

331
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
especially for the open source

332
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
components

333
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
all internet consists of

334
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,720
a lot of services

335
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
that use a lot of open components

336
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,040
and

337
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
the solution that we published

338
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
long ago

339
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
is about integration of supply chain

340
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
analysis

341
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
which help the companies to monitor

342
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,360
security of the components they use

343
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,160
thank you dmitri

344
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
well from the viewpoint of security

345
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,430
products

346
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,079
[Music]

347
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,000
here we use

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
them inside the company but under

349
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
certain conditions why not

350
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
we could

351
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:37,630
uh

352
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,880
[Music]

353
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,759
opens something for a wider range of

354
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,040
community members

355
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
security

356
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,240
solutions that we use in the company are

357
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
based on open source and

358
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,680
if we publish them

359
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
they can be used in other companies as

360
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,719
well

361
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
as for the company it's more focused on

362
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
the products

363
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,759
that are used outside the company but

364
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,250
they are not about security

365
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,800
[Music]

366
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
we have such products

367
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,440
the database for example which has a

368
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,160
community around or then the community

369
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
makes its

370
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,160
contribution but security is not the

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
main target for such kind of publishing

372
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
sergey the question is to you

373
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,560
colleagues

374
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,519
are

375
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
for opening and say it is good but on

376
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
the other hand

377
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,119
they give examples

378
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,759
not related to security click house for

379
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,160
instance can be used in the in-house cm

380
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
big data security analytics but it's not

381
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
about security as such

382
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
have you good got

383
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,320
a good

384
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
security based

385
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,640
open source project example

386
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
with the company saying

387
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,599
we are developing it not community the

388
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,720
company

389
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,679
it says this is open source we published

390
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
it and we developed it

391
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,799
just one addition

392
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,439
perhaps

393
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
it's easier for the positive to do it

394
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,240
because it's focused on security

395
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
our focus is different

396
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,280
we

397
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,400
cannot

398
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,679
publish everything that we use inside we

399
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,919
nee we need r d we need competence

400
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,120
and

401
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,440
everything depends on the

402
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
competence

403
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,919
well

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
we have a good

405
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,240
area when open source became commercial

406
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,960
commercial became open source elastic

407
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,240
for instance

408
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
it's a database

409
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,039
which now everyone has inside

410
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,840
no one

411
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,480
agrees no one

412
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
admits

413
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
it's a good step

414
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
a bit toxic about licensing but

415
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
technically a good one

416
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,960
and you can build your

417
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
socks on that

418
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
siway

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,960
illinois verizon

420
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,840
bought it and contributed

421
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,799
in

422
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,480
security it's a standard story

423
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
database management system

424
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
rapid7

425
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
in general

426
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,559
i am often asked we see a lot of good

427
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,080
stories about infrastructure

428
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,559
and custom software

429
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,760
why not security software why nexus

430
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,320
became open watson and then was broken

431
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
software has one component which

432
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
others uh

433
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
sometimes lack it's a knowledge base

434
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
without knowledge base it wouldn't work

435
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,440
properly

436
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
and we have to find the balance between

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
the engine

438
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,840
and the knowledge base suricata for

439
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,200
instance which was mentioned and

440
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
which all the vendors

441
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
have

442
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,720
they found a good balance there is a

443
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,039
there are community rules there are

444
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,200
additional rules

445
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
which are beneficial but if you want to

446
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,640
be

447
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,080
at the cutting edge you have to buy

448
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,559
a commercial subscription

449
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,760
and

450
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
on the one hand this delays development

451
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,880
a little bit on the other hand it gives

452
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,280
an additional opportunity

453
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,320
for them

454
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,960
to develop commercially

455
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,480
our model is yes

456
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
we build good open source solutions we

457
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,400
contribute to them we develop our own

458
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
solutions we opens

459
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
part of

460
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,520
knowledge base which are sufficient

461
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
to bring in benefits

462
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,240
but they cost the money

463
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,799
what about community if there is a

464
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
company that develops something it

465
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
invests

466
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
in development it hires good developers

467
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,480
it wants to earn the money

468
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,880
and it's a classical story that any

469
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
vendor

470
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,039
supported open source all supports open

471
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,200
source has two branches one commercial

472
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
cisco snartom

473
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
verizon with gaussian

474
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,039
elastic with elastic

475
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,200
a lot of examples

476
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,679
where is the community role especially

477
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,080
in russia

478
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,840
because in the west there is a

479
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,320
vendor who earns the money and helps to

480
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
develop community what about russia

481
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,400
because most of our vendors are

482
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
truly proprietary and they're used to

483
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
proprietary solutions can they find a

484
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
solution that would help them to

485
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,440
open their engines and databases and

486
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
earn on

487
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,880
services and rules only

488
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,080
so we can ask the vendor

489
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,039
who is present here my point of view is

490
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,720
as follows

491
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,320
i talk to many companies

492
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,520
and i will talk to more there are a lot

493
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,120
of solutions

494
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
that

495
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,240
need to be returned to the community

496
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,360
the open source has a trap

497
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
you take a version you start working

498
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,880
with it you contribute you invest your

499
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,440
time and money and then you see that the

500
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,240
community is one step ahead

501
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
if you

502
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
didn't contribute to the community

503
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,440
before

504
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,280
well you use

505
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,360
the obsolete version like windows 95

506
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,159
in the year 2000

507
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,280
and many russian problems

508
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,559
many russian vendors face some the same

509
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,520
problem sometimes they elect

510
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,480
the time others believe we can give it

511
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
we don't want to give our knowledge to

512
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
competition but now

513
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
we know we understand that we must

514
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
consolidate we must contribute to the

515
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,440
community if it is not just one vendor

516
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
but several vendors

517
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,400
they can build a good

518
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
knowledge base interesting for the wider

519
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
community like surikat for instance they

520
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
have a consortium of the companies that

521
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,120
help them

522
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,840
there are big contributors so this is

523
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,960
the idea and this is the hope and i hope

524
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,679
let me tell you one thing

525
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,280
using open source model will help many

526
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,120
companies to cut cost because they will

527
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,039
not spend on a lot of money on

528
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,440
closing their

529
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,840
source code

530
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,600
what about the two branches of your

531
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,159
solutions the commercial one and the

532
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,200
open

533
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,279
source one

534
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,919
one is sold the other

535
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,159
brings you revenues

536
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
from services only

537
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,120
cm for instance for us is it a way for

538
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,080
you

539
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
uh

540
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
so do you see it as

541
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
beneficial of course this is an open

542
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,559
source section don't criticize

543
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,640
open source but well

544
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,080
what do you think honestly honestly we

545
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
as a company

546
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,400
feel

547
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,360
one

548
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,840
headache

549
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,480
very clever people

550
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,559
who could

551
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,159
exchange knowledge

552
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,080
do not do that on our products

553
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,880
there is a cured language from github

554
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
for statistical and for static analysis

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,679
when it

556
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
appeared the codes for ql

557
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,200
were

558
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,919
was shared

559
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,200
within

560
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
a few hours

561
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
no vendor

562
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,679
can

563
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,679
include signatures

564
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,640
on a 24x7 basis it can be done by

565
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,799
community only

566
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,000
honestly we are the vendors but we sell

567
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,640
our expertise very good expertise we

568
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,720
have very good experts

569
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
who can

570
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,720
disclose

571
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,880
vulnerabilities and

572
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,919
eliminate them

573
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,640
the engine

574
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,320
the knowledge base is our core

575
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,080
that helps us to exist and develop

576
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
and of course we cannot

577
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
give away

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
the engine although we wouldn't lose the

579
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
money there because we have very few

580
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
people who can

581
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,559
uh

582
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,440
write

583
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,039
such engines and they wouldn't buy

584
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,000
it from us or from kaspersky as for the

585
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,120
knowledge base it's very difficult to

586
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
distribute knowledge base for free

587
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,130
because this is our

588
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,799
[Music]

589
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,039
well our benefit

590
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,679
i saw different approaches

591
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,200
one no when the knowledge base is

592
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
published

593
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,480
instantly for money

594
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,440
free

595
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,200
at a later stage

596
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,840
with a certain delay

597
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,720
so and each of the products

598
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
has its own way

599
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,919
some should publish a little later

600
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
others could

601
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
still sell some very specific

602
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,960
subtle things all the time

603
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
many vendors

604
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,279
publish

605
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,120
connectors

606
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
strikes cicd

607
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,080
all those things they

608
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,880
publish it in open source community they

609
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
consist of just a few

610
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
scripts it's

611
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,760
easier to customize than to

612
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,840
buy it for the vendor

613
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,400
it's

614
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,360
moving away from the main focus

615
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,520
so

616
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
the programmers say that it would be

617
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,159
easier for them to

618
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,440
protect their code

619
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,399
when i come to programmers and say

620
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,840
well

621
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,760
you can publish it

622
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,840
they say oh no no we need to clean it

623
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,000
half a year later

624
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
so on the one hand it requires more

625
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
resources on the other hand it's more

626
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,279
responsibility

627
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,679
it's an interesting situation because we

628
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,600
cannot stop

629
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
moving into open source we are moving

630
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
and we shall move there but there are

631
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,919
problems like what to do with

632
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,760
knowledge bases

633
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,279
then what about

634
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
programmers it's

635
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,679
striptease for the programmers thank you

636
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,279
vladimir

637
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,279
actually you'll be

638
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,600
answering for the regulator today

639
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,159
so therefore my question

640
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
will be security for security and more

641
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
specifically about certification yes i'm

642
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
sorry regulators in this country like

643
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,159
unfortunately that the products that

644
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
they mark with a approved label

645
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,760
so they wanted to come from a specific

646
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,399
vendor so that they should have a

647
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,600
specific

648
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,960
and ongoing support and so the defendant

649
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,559
should be held responsible uh for

650
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,880
removing the vulnerabilities in the

651
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,279
product even if it's open source

652
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,399
so how much uh is the story even though

653
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,320
i understand there is more

654
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,880
to your partners but perhaps you have

655
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,840
some information how other regulators

656
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
including the

657
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,840
ministry of digital development

658
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,559
address a situation where open source

659
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,840
sees a community there's no

660
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,120
direct

661
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
support with slas

662
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,120
just like in

663
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,679
enterprise solutions and it's

664
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,600
done on best effort a principle so how

665
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,480
can

666
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,440
this

667
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,720
be

668
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,159
mapped against

669
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,799
the regulators requirement

670
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,279
requirements

671
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,520
can we

672
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,919
match open source and certification

673
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,640
requirements because without this for a

674
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,279
lot of corporates this story will remain

675
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,799
beautiful on paper

676
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
yes indeed i'll probably have to answer

677
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,159
for other regulators

678
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,720
and therefore they will be able to deny

679
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,559
what i just say

680
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
firstly i love how denis is speaking

681
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,039
here dennis

682
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
thank you very much i remembered

683
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,480
uh so you know putting her code to the

684
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,799
open source uh is

685
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,080
like

686
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,120
a

687
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,200
thing that a developer should be ashamed

688
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,399
of and giving it to the government uh

689
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,799
not okay at least you're frank

690
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
this now what to do

691
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,080
there are four different concepts open

692
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,520
source

693
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,720
uh freely distributed software trust and

694
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,720
security

695
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,440
so these are all different concepts

696
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,240
open source it doesn't mean

697
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,039
that

698
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,760
it is free and free software doesn't

699
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
mean it's going to be

700
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,159
open source

701
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,480
at the same time

702
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
trust and security are also different

703
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,520
terms and if it is open source

704
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,879
or free software

705
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
it can by

706
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,399
default

707
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,520
be either trusted or secure

708
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,840
about which other regulators are always

709
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,480
trying uh to speak from the stage so

710
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,960
there was no

711
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,840
verification was run for

712
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,360
undocumented features so nobody has set

713
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
in a certified lab and

714
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,840
checked all the functions by the list

715
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,919
once somebody does that is going to

716
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,159
become trusted i'm not even going to

717
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,720
speak about security

718
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
that's the resilience of this software

719
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,559
to different threats

720
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,519
so what to do about this because if we

721
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,600
remember originally i said

722
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,080
ministry of digital development it does

723
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
support open source even in cyber

724
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,720
security there are two aspects here

725
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,000
first

726
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,840
it's a quite normal practice in the

727
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,240
market somebody say i want to do that

728
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
they take open source and say

729
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,519
i am going to run this

730
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,000
and i'm going to make

731
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
technical support and get it certified

732
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,279
okay we now get an owner and this owner

733
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,360
will be

734
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,120
following the

735
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
uh

736
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,760
updating but it ceases to be open source

737
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
at this point yes i agree there's

738
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,279
another approach you can stop uh calling

739
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,519
it

740
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,840
yes

741
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,960
as i

742
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,159
stop calling it

743
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
information protection system

744
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
uh i'll go about that we are build

745
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,519
building a

746
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,039
some information system

747
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,559
if it's not a national

748
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,840
security

749
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
based system where everything should be

750
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,919
certified then you are just complying

751
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,640
with the requirements let's say you have

752
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,159
built something created something let's

753
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,919
say a website and then you read the

754
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,440
requirement it says

755
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,880
so there should be a firewall there

756
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
should be an anti-virus and so on and so

757
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
forth there are these requirements and

758
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,679
all these additional requirements

759
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,200
so there are some

760
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
additional requirements for your

761
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,960
infrastructure and everything as to be

762
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,080
certified it doesn't mean

763
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,919
that you

764
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,559
can't do something additionally i never

765
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
i never saw a situation that somebody

766
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,519
would come to an organization say you

767
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,440
have a visp which is not certified

768
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
so for the regulator it doesn't matter

769
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,840
so they come

770
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,519
and who see that you're using a

771
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,159
certified uh solution

772
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,399
it's not just

773
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,600
so therefore

774
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,480
you have software yes uh you have it can

775
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,200
it be used yes it can be used so if you

776
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
are using it

777
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,279
for security purposes then go do it the

778
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,640
main thing is that if you have decided

779
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
that you are covering some nest

780
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
requirements then in this case you have

781
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,080
to go for certification and lose the

782
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
open source status because you get your

783
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,360
own fork

784
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,640
maybe maybe sometime down the road maybe

785
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,760
in a week

786
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,960
a

787
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
let's say a ministry of digital

788
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,640
development convenes and say we have

789
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
built

790
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,200
a domestic

791
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,399
repository which is trusted and secure

792
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,079
it is you're going to commit your code

793
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,480
there and like two institutes five

794
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
regulators and three labs are going to

795
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,960
make sure that it's good

796
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
so maybe it'll happen and maybe we'll

797
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,040
say thank you

798
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,599
well of course people will say something

799
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,918
if not thank you maybe something else

800
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:28,800
but

801
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,199
uh actually uh ministry of digital

802
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,839
development has been thinking about the

803
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,159
domestic repository

804
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,040
yes we are discussing inside how to make

805
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,839
this

806
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,199
domestic repository more trusted but in

807
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,040
this rush

808
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,359
so that all the software should be

809
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,399
trusted and therefore secure

810
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,079
we are risking

811
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,119
the whole

812
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,119
losing the whole concept of open source

813
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,359
community uh it's a

814
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,280
question that i won't be able to answer

815
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
today sergey

816
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
i just have a comment

817
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,820
firstly

818
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,079
[Applause]

819
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,599
trust doesn't exist without

820
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,200
responsibility

821
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
so therefore in the certification

822
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,560
model that makes sense uh

823
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,720
the irresponsible

824
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,760
entity should be

825
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
included because when you come to a

826
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,079
regulator you are saying

827
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,920
i

828
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,800
swear

829
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,280
i comply with these

830
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,560
rules

831
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,040
so and certification no certification

832
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
but there's good will

833
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,200
uh that you are offering is not going to

834
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
go away

835
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,680
if

836
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
uh there are no people who are going to

837
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,240
be prepared for this certification the

838
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,000
system won't work so i don't see a

839
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,079
problem about somebody taking open

840
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,880
source

841
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
and

842
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,000
submitted for certification because in

843
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,480
essence in the ideal world certification

844
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,920
should bring about

845
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,359
an improvement for the product

846
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,599
vulnerabilities will

847
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,640
have

848
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
been identified and identified for

849
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,240
instance somebody said the

850
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,560
authentication is not implemented

851
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,880
perfectly enough so you correct you

852
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,160
patch it and go on so what's the problem

853
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,079
i don't see this

854
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,640
problem of certification excluding open

855
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,560
source and a small comment what i liked

856
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
about this for me the real certification

857
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
model is when

858
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,200
where this formal part

859
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,800
uh can be made discreet so i come

860
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
once uh a year and say uh i swear this

861
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,720
version is certified it's good it meets

862
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,000
your criteria whereas the technical

863
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
verification as such

864
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
should be

865
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,040
continuous

866
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
and

867
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,760
could be spread in time because what's

868
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,359
its purpose is to correct me if i'm

869
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,359
wrong because so

870
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,480
essentially

871
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,800
the regulator should teach me to make my

872
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
product a little bit better and this

873
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,240
should be done continuously if i'm

874
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,839
saying that

875
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,280
i want to get a certificate for three

876
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,000
years so all the three years my products

877
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,640
may be available people will be able to

878
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
look into it correct find errors and

879
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,000
correct me i don't see

880
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,440
any uh contradiction between the code

881
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
being open source and certified

882
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
except the situation when one of the

883
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
regulators says that

884
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,560
you can't open

885
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,640
the source code because

886
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,359
it goes against security

887
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,680
and

888
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,359
dimitri you wanted to add something yes

889
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,839
a small comment

890
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
whether to call it

891
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
or not to use it

892
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,520
in terms

893
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,920
of the

894
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,560
you call it the information security

895
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,640
systems sdi in russian coding

896
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,160
it's not

897
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,760
really makes sense it doesn't really

898
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,880
make sense

899
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,839
you

900
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,000
have to deal with certification in one

901
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,480
way or the other

902
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,599
and maybe

903
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,440
we're seeing that the regulatory

904
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
frameworks are changing and it's great

905
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,920
the regulators are starting to work

906
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,520
actively on changing the regulations and

907
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,280
we're helping them to do that

908
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,359
it would be a very good if as part of

909
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,440
this change

910
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,000
this should also uh be

911
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,359
taken account of

912
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,800
so that

913
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
life should become easier for companies

914
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,599
which require

915
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,760
uh certification

916
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,359
so that this kind of open source

917
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,200
products could be used there because

918
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
this area is quite a gray area

919
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,599
dmitri i had a question for you and

920
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,680
you've probably taken it

921
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,760
yandex because it hosts

922
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,880
quite a lot

923
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
of

924
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
personal data systems critical

925
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,359
infrastructure sites i'm sure customers

926
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,200
are asking you all the time how do you

927
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,599
comply with the security requirements

928
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,359
and you have to be compliant with order

929
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,640
17 2235 31 and others and they require

930
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,599
these

931
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,520
security things and going away from this

932
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,960
rigmarole is not always possible so

933
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,400
vladimir

934
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,560
said so it's a good idea not to use the

935
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,280
term as they die that's

936
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,920
information security systems and not to

937
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,960
use cryptography but use let's say use

938
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,800
the word encoding but the regulator may

939
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,920
not agree

940
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,520
if you need in terms of protection and

941
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,560
compliance to use cryptography

942
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,520
to

943
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,880
effect connection between different

944
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,720
sites you have to use certified

945
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,960
cryptography on well for the russian

946
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
ghost

947
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,839
you use it everything's fine and you've

948
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,400
got an attestation for your system and

949
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,920
now

950
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,839
tell me

951
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,320
who or with autistic system

952
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,800
also submitted for open ssl

953
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
certification nobody or nobody have

954
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,920
has

955
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,880
this is to say that when we're using

956
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,200
different components

957
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,000
of

958
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,319
information protection systems

959
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,520
and others

960
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,960
we are not certifying everything at once

961
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
it never happens well of course it

962
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,599
happens but only very rarely in very

963
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,119
serious systems

964
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,440
yes

965
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,079
we need to do something like for

966
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,079
instance to close the

967
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,520
external perimeter what does the

968
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
government say what is the government

969
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,920
saying

970
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,200
so you

971
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
we're not going to check everything

972
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,960
you've done but on the perimeter you'll

973
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,480
have to use

974
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,040
a city for certified tools

975
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,440
the intrusion detection tool should also

976
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,599
be certified okay we're ticking the

977
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,680
boxes this doesn't preclude uh

978
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,880
you to use

979
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,240
uh if additional uh tools and solutions

980
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,040
i've never seen a situation where

981
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,400
they would tell no delete it uh delete

982
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
ssl how come it's cryptography it's not

983
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
certified it's never happened

984
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,240
but you're threatening us

985
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
because

986
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,880
attestation is done by a different

987
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,839
regulator for whom a encryption is an

988
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,160
absolutely different thing

989
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,800
okay i had an example about miss miss

990
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,839
we are not going we will all be able uh

991
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,200
to attest the system with myths is miss

992
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,920
security tool or just a separate system

993
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,839
well it's a good example because there

994
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,599
are no requirements to it and for the

995
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,680
regulator it's not clear at all what's

996
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,359
it about we perfectly understand what's

997
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,480
all about

998
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,160
so example for example you can you can

999
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,839
use example for example to find the

1000
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,599
right balance but look vladimir it

1001
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,160
appears that you're saying hey guys

1002
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,920
you must apply uh certified tools so

1003
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,880
it's

1004
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,800
more about proprietary vendors you won't

1005
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,960
be able to go away from that but in

1006
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,640
addition you can actually install a lot

1007
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,960
of open source tools that allow you uh

1008
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
to have additional levels of protection

1009
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,119
so maybe people would like to go away

1010
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,119
from proprietary solutions at all and

1011
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,359
you use open source everywhere but they

1012
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,839
can't because the regulator says

1013
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,720
don't do that you have to use only uh

1014
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,240
what's been tested by us and it's

1015
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,880
guaranteed well firstly this is the

1016
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
regular these are the regulations today

1017
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,440
and i can't argue with that uh i

1018
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,599
couldn't have argued had i not known but

1019
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,960
this is the way the regulations are

1020
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,119
built and i think it's right my previous

1021
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,520
examples are about

1022
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,760
what people are doing today what's going

1023
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,000
to happen tomorrow i've already shared

1024
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,400
that maybe we'll get some open source

1025
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,280
uh we'll have some open source to which

1026
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,599
uh will have a certain level of trust

1027
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,160
then this open source code will also be

1028
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,760
able to use the story with the

1029
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,440
certification of open source applicants

1030
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,359
and it stops to be open source code at

1031
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,839
this moment just at this moment when it

1032
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,000
got to known it has certified it is no

1033
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,960
longer an open source

1034
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,079
so in which direction

1035
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,880
one

1036
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
should think

1037
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,839
we have to think

1038
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,160
about situation the government is never

1039
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,480
a situation that everything used to be

1040
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,960
bad and tomorrow we're writing war and

1041
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,760
peace so everything happens in steps if

1042
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,839
you take a look at the process that's

1043
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,839
happening in the country of different

1044
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,280
laws past and decrees and orders

1045
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,160
we can find a certain

1046
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,560
progress there's a certain

1047
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,880
uh

1048
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,160
there's a certain process uh to

1049
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,480
replace uh the

1050
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,680
uh security tools uh from unfriendly

1051
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,720
nations then we'll have requirements to

1052
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,560
remove the

1053
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,520
security tools from neutral nations and

1054
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,680
it's only after that in this paradigm

1055
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,839
we'll find open source and only at the

1056
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,960
end we'll have a fully russian made

1057
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,040
software with certification we perfectly

1058
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,960
understand it's life

1059
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
it doesn't happen that

1060
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,760
today everything's bad and tomorrow we

1061
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,480
have everything covered

1062
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
so all uh it just doesn't work this way

1063
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,680
so therefore

1064
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,880
we

1065
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,760
are asking uh to at least follow this a

1066
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,680
chain of events if there's no russian

1067
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,079
software then go to open source there

1068
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,960
are additional requirements but open

1069
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,800
sources additional requirements which is

1070
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,520
very good and then

1071
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,760
we start talking about the proprietary

1072
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,200
software abroad

1073
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,000
thank you and this brings us to

1074
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,400
the end of the discussion discussion it

1075
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,079
passed quite quickly maybe it's going to

1076
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,079
be the last question terrace i'll start

1077
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,040
with you

1078
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,400
the situation

1079
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,359
with open source code verification for

1080
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
backdoors and other undocumented

1081
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,160
features we know the story with node abc

1082
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,680
that happened recently

1083
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
somebody

1084
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,480
that

1085
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,079
had the interest

1086
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,880
uh contributed say uh malicious

1087
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,599
component that that started deleting

1088
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,839
files that you could reach it's not the

1089
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,079
only story uh in the internet there at

1090
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,640
least three lists of such malicious open

1091
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,040
source components how to verify

1092
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
uh the code that other people

1093
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,560
maintain

1094
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,920
to

1095
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,839
make sure that there's nothing bad there

1096
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,079
for our infrastructure

1097
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,520
i'd like to say

1098
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,480
that this

1099
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,760
case is quite so good and very

1100
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,000
relevant but how is it done like in in

1101
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,079
this company we have a process

1102
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,400
implemented

1103
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,160
to

1104
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,560
take all components that we take from

1105
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
open source repositories

1106
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,560
and verify them and we perfectly

1107
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,920
understand uh that all the bricks

1108
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,040
that

1109
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,960
the open source solutions

1110
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,760
are

1111
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,880
built on

1112
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,920
uh

1113
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,839
their security is equal to the security

1114
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,160
of your system's goal you can't take

1115
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,560
some open source components from

1116
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,839
the world

1117
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:08,880
because

1118
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,800
it makes the development faster of

1119
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,960
course there should also always be a

1120
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,520
process to audit and to verify what

1121
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,880
specifically you take from the open

1122
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,920
source world for instance

1123
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,240
what's the history of this project

1124
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,400
what the code is like

1125
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,079
to do the around the audience of the

1126
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,560
code in a literal sense

1127
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,520
and

1128
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,200
in some all these activities allow you

1129
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,800
to get

1130
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,400
more confidence

1131
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,040
about this product but also you need

1132
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,560
so

1133
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,200
you're going to update it

1134
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,640
the development of these components is

1135
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,280
not going to stop so therefore you need

1136
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,079
to uh maintain uh monitoring of these

1137
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,240
components with regard to the

1138
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,400
vulnerabilities and i assure you that

1139
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,119
all developers who are present here

1140
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,480
a large part of the modern world

1141
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,119
are using uh third-party code

1142
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,319
so it's both a boon and a threat for

1143
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,520
security

1144
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,440
okay thank you

1145
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,680
so uh coming back to a pc

1146
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,319
it's uh obvious uh that it couldn't have

1147
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,800
been testing tested rather than

1148
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,200
through visual analysis how to do that

1149
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,720
especially for those companies who don't

1150
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,280
have the professionals to do that well

1151
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,760
actually i had an example

1152
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
a little bit earlier

1153
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,880
in a different company

1154
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,000
absolutely similar example but that was

1155
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,319
a contractor

1156
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,520
and again

1157
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,760
from activist

1158
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,240
considerations it was contracted and

1159
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,119
everything was being done and then

1160
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,280
so everything

1161
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,720
crashed and

1162
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,680
a lot of

1163
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,800
efforts had to be applied to remove

1164
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
the

1165
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,760
outcomes

1166
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,240
so open source or not open source

1167
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,400
is the same it's just open source has a

1168
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,760
broader coverage

1169
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,640
the question is about

1170
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,800
the following whether you take open

1171
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,680
source codes or closed

1172
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,040
codes

1173
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,359
you're taking the responsibility it's a

1174
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,480
matter of trust if you take a certified

1175
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,200
security tool then the vendor has said

1176
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
it's okay and the government has

1177
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,359
confirmed it's okay and when you just

1178
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,400
take something from a vendor uh it's uh

1179
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,119
what's written in in the euler as is

1180
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,920
like for instance it has the as is close

1181
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,640
close or anything

1182
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,440
else if you take open source code from

1183
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,319
git

1184
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,720
this is the license agreement and all

1185
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,960
the responsibility rests with you

1186
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,440
and here

1187
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,359
that basically is

1188
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,200
quite say

1189
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,119
an important task for the vendor uh who

1190
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,680
uses open source solutions verify the

1191
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,960
updates and also use the formal uh

1192
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,079
traces so who committed how and when and

1193
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,200
of course

1194
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,960
certain commits from certain countries

1195
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,079
here will have to be

1196
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,079
analyzed more detail

1197
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,720
so this supply chain that brings a lot

1198
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,480
more problems should be mentioned here

1199
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,520
because

1200
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,440
you just can't

1201
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,880
see deep enough uh what

1202
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,520
is part of your code who has contributed

1203
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,160
to it you see the basic code but then in

1204
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,440
three dependency hopes you see some

1205
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,480
library uh that uh uploads you don't

1206
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,400
know what indeed it takes a lot of

1207
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,920
effort but again it's back to the

1208
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,520
question of trust

1209
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,640
okay thank you dimitri and by the way

1210
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,520
the five eyes alliance has issued a

1211
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,319
bulletin that now attacks on providers

1212
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,800
have become more frequent services and

1213
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,640
the supply chain problems

1214
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,599
how

1215
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,760
does yandex cloud

1216
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,680
solve the problem with this external

1217
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,760
open source software that you must use

1218
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,400
in the ndx cloud in the next cloud

1219
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,800
there's a very strong

1220
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,880
internal team in terms of security

1221
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,319
review and the process is there and as

1222
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,079
we said what you need resources

1223
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,640
competencies and uh good professionals

1224
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,640
because

1225
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,359
even if you use open source uh

1226
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,119
code for your developments and because

1227
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,040
it's a critical part so we're paying a

1228
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,839
lot of attention to it

1229
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,240
and indeed

1230
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,520
so this

1231
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,160
visual review does produce results

1232
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,400
so manually

1233
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,319
there are quite strong

1234
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,599
professionals

1235
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:40,960
who manually

1236
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,000
find such things that you

1237
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,359
are surprised

1238
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,319
to see

1239
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,240
yes you need the process you need the

1240
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,040
people and you need the time

1241
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,440
and considering attempt to market and

1242
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,920
everything else this of course of course

1243
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,359
poses a problem

1244
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,319
but uh there's no other way out

1245
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,319
okay got that when you become a

1246
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,400
certifier you start understanding their

1247
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,839
pain yes clear vladimir in continuation

1248
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,480
of the same subject in 2016

1249
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,240
they hacked the linux me site in 2018

1250
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,440
they

1251
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,960
hacked the begin to linux

1252
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,240
website

1253
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,480
as a repository through backdoors if uh

1254
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
minister of digital development is going

1255
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,319
to become uh the state uh repository so

1256
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,559
who will be a carry responsibility if

1257
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,119
somebody introduces a backdoor

1258
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,040
and these malicious updates start

1259
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,440
rolling out across the country actually

1260
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,880
it goes well with the previous question

1261
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,319
the idea

1262
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,520
i think

1263
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,559
has just been born and we may support it

1264
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:49,520
but look

1265
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,680
open source

1266
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,440
today this session

1267
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,520
i mean i mentioned this word trust

1268
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,599
during this session quite a lot by the

1269
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,920
way nobody's responsible for trust for

1270
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,880
software

1271
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,599
security they do but not for trust

1272
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,040
but uh i

1273
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,480
have been mentioning this word quite

1274
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,359
often so often uh today uh that i liked

1275
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,559
it open source is built on trust and uh

1276
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,480
for quite long time open source has been

1277
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,400
suffering from this it had a lot of

1278
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,640
problems with trust has been discussed

1279
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,240
quite a lot and only in russia but all

1280
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,520
over the world and in the past few

1281
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,079
months the institute of trust has been

1282
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,119
just shattered so what to do i was

1283
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,640
listening to the british speaker what to

1284
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,680
do with this

1285
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,640
open source is a community and a

1286
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,880
community is a story

1287
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,920
about

1288
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,880
collective unconscious you

1289
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,240
have to fight it with a collective uh

1290
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,559
irresponsibility so i think it's the

1291
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,240
story about the bug bounty of open

1292
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
source so what i'm talking about maybe

1293
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
you should make not the contributors but

1294
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,680
the main users

1295
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,680
so you use libraries

1296
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,559
or

1297
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,280
some kind of libraries or tools or fun

1298
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,839
features you should contribute your

1299
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:00,800
effort

1300
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,680
into

1301
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,720
the overall bug bounty uh

1302
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,960
effort i think yandex has started to be

1303
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,200
more nervous yes first i heard is that

1304
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,400
everything

1305
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,280
is used by yonders they ran a code

1306
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,400
review

1307
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,920
so

1308
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,240
so i'm i'm actually

1309
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,440
jotting down everything i've heard here

1310
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,640
so this is the story that we have

1311
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,800
the tools even today

1312
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,240
that are used too broadly in open source

1313
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,839
the backdoors there

1314
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,119
you know affect the entire economy the

1315
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,760
entire civil infrastructure and this is

1316
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
the story about why not to try to

1317
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,520
collect this thing and to implement it

1318
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,480
this will also be a tool to ensure

1319
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,559
the security of

1320
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,480
domestic repository

1321
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,440
you should use team efforts to

1322
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,200
protect from a

1323
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,800
team

1324
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,319
problems

1325
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,800
so what should we should customers do

1326
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,839
who

1327
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,000
now come back to the topic of open

1328
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,839
source

1329
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,359
so running

1330
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,960
the

1331
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,680
uh conclusions uh is a strong mission i

1332
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,280
actually had a question of how vladimir

1333
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
combines the desire to use the word

1334
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,280
trust and also to

1335
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,839
jot down uh

1336
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,400
what everybody said

1337
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,800
nevertheless

1338
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,680
let me suggest some ideas i know one

1339
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,240
regulator had an idea of certifying

1340
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,920
other projects

1341
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,040
but the pipeline of

1342
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,119
building the product and the process so

1343
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,200
once you add something in the process

1344
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,880
the problems sure most problems should

1345
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,920
be sold this tech uh implemented that is

1346
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,240
just what they claim i don't know

1347
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,599
how

1348
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,599
realistic the story of the story is

1349
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,680
actually uh it will take us for another

1350
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,760
hour of discussions but coming back to

1351
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,440
the question

1352
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,440
when we're talking about supply chain

1353
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,839
and commits to open source that have

1354
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,759
been initially malicious

1355
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,440
we have used this

1356
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,040
quite large and

1357
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,599
included some verification

1358
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,079
algorithm in our products and by the way

1359
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,839
there's a technical presentation about

1360
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:23,520
this in another session but uh very

1361
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,079
simplistically i think the impact

1362
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,960
that the manufacturers want to make

1363
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,720
may be quite different and it's quite

1364
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,160
different uh to find the signature is

1365
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,440
difficult but the geography check is

1366
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,599
much simpler

1367
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,880
than finding an impact

1368
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,319
other than that i don't see

1369
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:51,520
that there's anything special that must

1370
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,400
differ

1371
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,599
make

1372
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,839
a

1373
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,559
securities of the avenger against a

1374
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,040
regular i.t vendor

1375
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,200
so code reviews uh are also a certain

1376
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,280
thing that you need to be

1377
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,680
done i don't believe that without guys

1378
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,760
like that

1379
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,119
any vendor can do without

1380
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,319
colleagues let's learn the results of

1381
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,599
this discussion

1382
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,559
it's obvious that in 50 minutes that we

1383
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:21,680
had

1384
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
it was impossible for us to cover all

1385
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,119
these topics uh about open source code

1386
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,720
applying it to the current realities

1387
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,240
because the reality have changed

1388
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,240
considerably over the past two months

1389
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,119
but the most important things that we

1390
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,119
could hear from our colleagues is that

1391
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,520
you need to have the people

1392
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,720
and just

1393
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,559
next door to the section there was close

1394
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,240
section about uh

1395
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,720
human resources where this problem was

1396
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,200
also discussed and indeed it's a core

1397
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,760
problem and i hope uh that thanks to the

1398
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,280
ministry of uh digital development and

1399
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
efforts and other regulators we're going

1400
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
to have more professionals

1401
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,760
who will not be

1402
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,520
just

1403
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,079
who will not just have habits

1404
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,240
going abroad to different conferences to

1405
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,359
purchase

1406
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,640
foreign

1407
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,240
solutions but

1408
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,559
they will be used

1409
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,319
they will get the

1410
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,200
ability to use open source solutions and

1411
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,760
do it in a more trusted environment in a

1412
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,079
more trusted mode than it used to be

1413
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,920
than the past so without the people

1414
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,680
unfortunately this whole idea will not

1415
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,480
fly and one thing that remains uh too

1416
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,200
hopeful that in the next

1417
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,160
year before the next phd

1418
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,599
ph days uh we'll get some best practices

1419
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,040
uh to use open source not in private pro

1420
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,559
projects not in technology companies but

1421
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,440
in rank and file plays in the market who

1422
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,000
have now found themselves face to face

1423
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,280
uh with

1424
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,160
the

1425
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,240
reality uh now that the foreign

1426
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,839
inventors have left the russian market

1427
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,160
many thanks to you for the participation

1428
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,359
for those who have been in the room

1429
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,720
those who have watched us online and

1430
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,480
many thanks to the colleagues responding

1431
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,960
my provocative questions and

1432
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,000
so

1433
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,799
till we see again in our next meetings

1434
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:17,640
during ph days thank you very much
