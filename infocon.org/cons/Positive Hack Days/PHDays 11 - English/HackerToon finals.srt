259
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,880
the

260
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,000
artworks we have enjoyed most

261
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,640
we can even explain why

262
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,440
but

263
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,680
i believe that you have said it anyway

264
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,560
okay we have picked numbers seven

265
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,240
and ten

266
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,920
so these are the two artworks we have

267
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,680
enjoyed most

268
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,118
well this is quite interesting

269
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,880
and this works

270
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,240
well noah has nominations or kind of mix

271
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,200
because work seven is drama

272
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,319
and uh this is a very deep story and a

273
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,040
very sad story you know i even cried and

274
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,079
you know number 10 is a comic book

275
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,760
well this is animation but this is a

276
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,200
comic book

277
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,480
and

278
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
it was a lot of fun

279
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
or in a strange way

280
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,440
so

281
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,720
i don't know

282
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,319
what kind of animations we should use

283
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,000
for the diplomas but these are the two

284
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,200
best

285
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
artworks there are

286
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,280
a couple of more good works but we're

287
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,800
not mentioning them

288
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
and you know

289
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,240
i had tchaikovsky's

290
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
contest and there

291
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,440
place one wasn't given

292
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,240
for piano

293
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,480
since they didn't find

294
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,599
good

295
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,319
players

296
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,680
yeah indeed

297
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,880
we couldn't find uh the frog because uh

298
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
well we were not uh engaged

299
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,680
okay do you have the author of uh

300
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,359
artwork seven here

301
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,560
okay

302
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,880
okay

303
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,760
[Music]

304
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
10.

305
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,800
[Music]

306
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,040
and

307
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,119
and for some reason i thought

308
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,079
that this can be only born in the

309
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,480
fantasies of a boy i thought that the

310
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,440
author

311
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
was a

312
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,599
boy but i see a girl

313
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,560
so this means that

314
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,920
full of empathy so you can understand

315
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,400
that the boy wants the girl

316
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,760
to kind of uh

317
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,000
give him good feedback

318
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
okay will we let you

319
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,480
say a few words

320
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,720
yeah this was surprising

321
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,400
well i'd like to take this opportunity

322
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,440
to thank the organizers

323
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,720

349
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
i was deeply touched

350
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,400
so much impressed in terms of colors and

351
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,160
drama

352
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,079

this reference to leonov

356

so

357
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,040
i like the links

358
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,800
when you can see something

359
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,599
some

360
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,680
say second layer not under the story but

361
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
also some

362
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,280
deeper sense which goes

363
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
through this another way it's been done

364
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,240
i really liked it

365
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
animation computer well it's computer

366
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,000
animation but here they also used

367
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,560
some hand work so it was

368
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,400
done by hand

369
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,119
and i really liked it

370
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,119
now talking to my students primarily

371
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,480
so what you do

372
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,000
by hand we are okay with computers but

373
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,160
the computer is just a tool

374
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,079
you shouldn't do everything

375
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,560
on the computer and the sound director

376
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,160
will tell me that analog

377
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,359
things work

378
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,560
well

379
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,200
we are analogous we are not digital and

380
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,118
the second thing let us try

381
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,359
background this is not

382
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,480
anything for highlighting or stressing

383
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,720
any ideas

384
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,720
quite possibly

385
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,000
no objections

386
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,560
yeah i like music

387
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,960
well i understand

388
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,240
is important

389
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,920
and you can you can

390
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,760
kind of hide behind it and it's

391
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
kind of uh

392
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,040
lucrative well for the animation guys

393
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,720
well you should be able to do it on your

394
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,960
own without any music

395
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,040
so that it should be primarily a

396
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,680
standalone thing and music should kind

397
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,359
of highlight

398
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,000
some elements well as a musician well

399
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,359
indeed

400
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,040
i don't watch

401
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,880
the

402
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,119
clips and so music should be standalone

403
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,480
if we start with that as music

404
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,839
uh track

405
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,480
or song and if we talk about animation

406
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,760
and cartoons or videos well indeed video

407
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,960
primarily

408
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,040
should have some

409
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,920
essence can wait

410
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,880
okay

411
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,200
thank you

412
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,598

this dialect is real

426
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,760
this is our dialogue

427
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,440
this happened last summer we were

428
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,720
preparing for exams

429
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,119
i was living with her

430
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,680
for the time of the exams

431
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,960
and when we listened to this

432
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,520
track we decided okay that's

433
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,839
that's it let's do it

434

i enjoyed your work

448
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,720
but

449
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,599
alcohol was kind of a barrier for me

450
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,359
i don't support it i have seen many

451
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,240
well

452
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,359
many

453
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,200
broken lives so please don't drink it

454
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,720
well

455
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,200
this is part of my life as well i have

456
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,280
lived for this i understood this

457
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,720
emotionally

458
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,720
but

459
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,160
well it's not certainly the mind level

460
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,680
well i mean

461
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,599
this is

462
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,119
kind of energy and to

463
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,520
move forward you know alcohol was a

464
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,760
alcohol was a barrier thank you for the

465
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,160
job done

466
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,400

467
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,160
co-author of the soundtrack we

468
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,200
co-authored it with ernest and i'm not a

469
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,920
member of the jewelry because i sent

470
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,280
their

471
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,280
work 11 but it's not under the

472
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,359
nomination so i know this song i

473
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,720
developed it

474
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,680
and

475
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,599
i had both video

476
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,720
and sound it came from one source

477
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,599
and

478
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,480
well

479
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,839
i

480
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,000
don't know how to draw not back at

481
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,800
school they told me that

482
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,960
what i draw is not

483
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,599
but i'm a hacker i deal with ai that's

484
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,880
why i took what i could with the ai

485
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,119
to make this video and i believe this is

486
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,960
quite interesting we have the light

487
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,559

and traditional animation

490
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,800
and something which is

491
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,880
completely done by the machine with a

492
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,680
lot of help from a human being so we

493
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,680
have a complete mix

494
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,599
and this is just in tune with the

495
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,280
