1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,199
hi everyone i'm naster

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,319
i'm from youth csb i'm in for

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,040
pin tests there and sometimes with these

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,160
tests i would have to run such checkups

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,880
and

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,040
today i'm going to

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
talk about how it can run

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
such text tests with the pdf files with

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
the

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,119
javascript embedded

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,039
so some introduction so that we

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
understand what i'm going to talk about

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,159
a few words about actual statistics in

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,920
the beginning then we'll try to create a

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,040
pdf file in our notepad

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,040
we'll add the javascript there then

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,079
we'll

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,960
speak about how the documents can be

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,360
embedded into javascript with the use of

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,000
python and then we'll check out uh how

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
we can get rid of anti-virus solution

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,760
like we said

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
previously this is the statistics of

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
positive technologies that i used

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,719
previously

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
last year

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,080
main number of

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
attacks was through

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,840
malware

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
half of them accounted for social

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
engineering attempts

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
yet in more than half of the cases

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
malware was spreaded through

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
electronic mail through email

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
so for such pen tests

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
i would like to get

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
no

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
let me say it differently normally what

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
happens

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360
a fraudster comes up with a document or

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
a link and sends it by email to the

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
victim the victim gets it normally there

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
is a threat

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,479
a threatening message normally so please

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,360
open this file otherwise

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
so forth or for example

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
your salary has arrived just the major

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
huge so the victim opens this file and

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,640
then there is something horrible occurs

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,439
uh while opening this file and the

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,079
fraudster gets the necessary feedback

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
some personal data

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,199
shell whatever

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,239
so for such checkups a document is

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
required with no exploits not being a

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
malicious one

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,239
being benign uh

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
still it would be able to send to the

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
pentester

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
uh

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
some feedback that there was some

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
payload

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,879
executed

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
so why not use

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,680
the pdf format for that

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,959
so

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,160
adobe had added javascript in there did

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
it in favor

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,200
so

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
it's a

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
nice readable format so there is nothing

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
unclear here in pdf

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,519
that we open here in the notepad

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,400
so

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
if we would like to get the base uh

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
would

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,159
be given links to pages right here then

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,879
i'm only just showing here one page in

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,680
object three this page stores some

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
resources just

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
a size of the font

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
and the actual content is embedded in

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,720
object

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,000
four

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
it's kind of a

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
flow of bytes

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
a stream of bites simple as that

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
it says a

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,319
size sixth font hello world

90
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,798
just a message and then we'll have to

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,799
get the crosslinks

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
objects

93
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,840
adobe is capable of reading it anyway

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
but ideally that would be just uh

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
the list of

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,799
all of the changes until it reaches the

97
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
object then its trail and then the

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
link to the source object and the

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
another shift should be added to the

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
cross links table

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
and then there is a marker in the end of

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
the file etc

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
basically and this is what it looks like

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
like we expect it to look

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
uh in the adobe reader javascript can be

106
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
added there anywhere that's added

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,599
anywhere

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,720
where

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,040
an action is conducted this is what it

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
looks like the type of action

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,358
javascript and with

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,919
javascript we add a very simple alert

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
script like we've all seen it here

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
so with the names branch

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
which runs

116
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
in the document

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
till the end and you can add some

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
functions in there my code for example

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
and you can

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,280
come back to this

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
javascript

122
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,759
when necessary and this is what this

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,720
warning

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
pop-up sign looks like

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
that's the first thing that runs while

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
launching the document

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
yet uh

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
executing this code and pdf is a strange

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
thing as soon as adobe had edit there

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
it was immediately exploited exploited

131
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
for attacks and in 2007 api

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,120
was created for that which uh splits

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
the functions into the privileged ones

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
and non-privileged ones all the critical

135
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,639
functions

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,320
should have run

137
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
in the privileged context so for example

138
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
launch url it launches url it addresses

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,479
to a third party resource it's a

140
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,400
privileged function

141
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,320
so it's it's important to say what

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
that the pop-up message with the

143
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
permission button

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
should

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,880
spring up and only after the user clicks

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
this button the function executes

147
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,400
i really

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,120
very much liked this library with the

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
repository to which i have left the link

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
here on this particular slide

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
and we'll be adding a very simple code

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
app alert

153
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
all the fonts for example

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
uh

155
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
have become

156
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
unavailable so you need to upl download

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
the codes from and fonts from some other

158
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,280
resorts

159
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
so this is what it looks like

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
a dictionary a code

161
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
etc

162
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
this is what this string of code looks

163
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,479
like i think it's quite clear

164
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
and a few links

165
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,720
and obfuscation

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,639
of which i'm going to share some views a

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,080
little later and this is what is

168
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
happening we are launching

169
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
the actual alert pop-up

170
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,520
there is nothing interesting in here and

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
now

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,560
a few interesting things before

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
the user clicks this

174
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,759
allow permission

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,720
dns request will be generated and it

176
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
does not resolve

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
if it had resolved then it would have

178
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,280
ended

179
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,000
but the pdf runs it like this

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
it does not resolve it and just one

181
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
final string results

182
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
and that's what happens

183
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,880
and we can track uh that the document

184
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
has been opened

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,599
the previous alert cannot be closed you

186
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
can only kill this process or click ok

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
alternatively

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,199
so

189
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
the user gave the permission so the

190
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
data acceptance started

191
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,199
and that's what goes to adobe reader

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
in different

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
applications it works a little bit

194
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
differently

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
and we all know that if a user opens it

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,479
in a browser

197
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
in a chrome browser

198
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
it uses its own reader

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,120
and its functionality is even more

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,759
limited than the adobe reader and if i

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,440
would like to launch the scripts the

202
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
same script in the names and the open

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
action it would not run but you can run

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
it in the annotations

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
by the way

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
and the construction looks a little bit

207
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
more complicated and this is what it

208
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
does

209
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,879
a light

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
blue shade

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,919
applies

212
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
to the area and

213
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,360
it applies there while this script runs

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,159
this alert pops up and you cannot do

215
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,679
anything but

216
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,279
closing the tab but the user will will

217
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
not be getting any feedback from the

218
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
reader they will just simply click ok it

219
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
seems like nothing has happened but the

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
request

221
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
will be sent however

222
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
a few words about obfuscation

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,560
uh two methods i've singled out flows

224
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
for instance is the first one

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
we had

226
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
taken a look at them previously without

227
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,279
filters

228
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
what can you do with the flow

229
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,519
add a filter

230
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
like i'm showing here seems like nothing

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
is clear nothing it's transparent but

232
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,200
these filters is more just like you know

233
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
putting obstacles on the way of the

234
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
people who are

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,519
going to

236
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
work with these files addressing issues

237
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,800
and you can edit

238
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
till

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
the actual infinity so in the flow

240
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
objects can be

241
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
loaded a few objects

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,080
with a special object stm key shown here

243
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,480
and you can show the shift the number

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
the link to the first object etc

245
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,160
and the manipulation with strings

246
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
so you can

247
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,959
replace as many letters in the name

248
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
as you wish

249
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,920
to this representation and you can

250
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,120
create by this 16 bit representation

251
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,160
such names

252
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,360
and some software

253
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
how to put it that specialize in reading

254
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,279
the pdf format

255
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,519
such software cannot perceive it

256
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
in actual fact it was more than enough

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,760
i've just put this file uploaded it to

258
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
virustotal it had coded it in 16-bit and

259
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,600
it resolves it and says everything works

260
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
fine and it's clean

261
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
i'm almost done

262
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
such examples of code

263
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
have been uploaded to

264
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,279
uploaded to my repository

265
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
so you can check it out for examples

266
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,880
later on and

267
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
downloaded it

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
yes you can take pictures

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
and i'm actually quite done and thank

270
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,760
you very much for joining me

271
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,839
uh do i have time for questions by the

272
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
way

273
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
yeah

274
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
like always we have 10 minutes for

275
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
questions if any

276
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
there is

277
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
can the user not see the pop-up window i

278
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
repeat your question right

279
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
you need to use microphones for

280
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,839
questions

281
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
we can't hear questions without mics

282
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,600
and the audience can't seem to hear them

283
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
so if you continue asking you a question

284
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,839
please grab a mic

285
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,640
so she's answering um the question which

286
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,360
she didn't quite understand and she asks

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
okay

288
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,519
as soon as you get it you get it

289
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,640
resolved and in the adobe reader you can

290
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
shut down the launch of such scripts uh

291
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
third-party scripts and nothing will be

292
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
launched

293
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
and you you can launch it in a sandbox

294
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,060
if you like so

295
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,240
[Music]

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
yes it can be done so in order to remove

297
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,079
this

298
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,600
permission window

299
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
you need to exploit it and there are

300
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880
such ways of bypassing it in adobe

301
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,480
reader there are such ways

302
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
i hope this answers your question and it

303
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
does yes and we have

304
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,440
the next question then please use the

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,800
microphone for the question

306
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,000
you you can't hear me but i'm here with

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
the mike and i'm here with the question

308
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
you are talking about javascript uh

309
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
running it in adobe and you mentioned

310
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
that if the the pdf reader

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
is running on a different engine

312
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,519
different

313
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
ways should be introduced there to run

314
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
such exploits the question is why not

315
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,519
use not only gs but some

316
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,079
executable environment of the operating

317
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,519
system itself in adobe if it launches

318
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
you can add a payload

319
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,160
to cnd

320
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
for instance adobe launches

321
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,639
from user on user account

322
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,959
on the corporate environment

323
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
laptop computer

324
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
and adobe can

325
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
call the launch of this third-party

326
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
application did you consider such cases

327
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
of launching it in the

328
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,680
operating system environment yes i did

329
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,360
consider that but api would not allow us

330
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
use it without the exploit you need to

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
overflow the buffer or you need to

332
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,360
exploit some kind of vulnerability

333
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
just doing it through child process

334
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
you would not run it would not execute

335
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,119
it

336
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,639
it didn't anyway

337
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,839
any other questions

338
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,920
you need to use microphones for

339
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,440
questions microphones please do that

340
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,959
uh

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
what was the question

342
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,720
i think yes that's the answer

343
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
and

344
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
well like i can't really answer this

345
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
question exactly i i didn't um tackle

346
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
that that you're asking about but maybe

347
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,440
some corporate antivirus will do

348
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
like windows defender

349
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
like windows defender is sufficient just

350
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
to send it to some corporate mail

351
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,959
but

352
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,240
it would just bypass the filter and

353
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
the user may launch this file finding it

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
on its on their email

355
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
i think i'm done yes no other questions

356
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,439
and
