1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,279
and right now we're switching to julia

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,759
and she's going to give us the overview

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
of the current condition

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
of what really happens in this cyber

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,759
fight well i'm glad to see all of you

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,599
here thank you very much vladimir for

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,160
giving me the floor i promised you that

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
i'm going to come back to our replica of

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,800
this state but right now we are going to

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,640
have a more interesting conversation

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
it's going to be wider and more

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,800
interesting because vladimir

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
which is going to come to the view

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
vladimir nazareth

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
so he's going to use my hands

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,480
and i'm going to help him in

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,760
demonstrating of what might happen with

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
the big industry and how problems in

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,519
this industry can influence other

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,359
companies well as i've told you in the

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,559
morning

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,719
maybe some of you did not watch it we

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,280
have oil industry which was represented

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
by three new cells cell number one is

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
production then transportation and

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,560
storage

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,720
and then the third one is oil refinery

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,600
and sales

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,240
download so let's begin so what are we

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,119
going to show

31
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,400
where the oil comes from

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
what do you know from the school it

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,960
comes from under the ground and uh in

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,400
the course of a million years

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
something was boiling under the ground

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,520
and what do you see in this

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,439
replica

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,280
well something was uh

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,960
deteriorating under the ground and

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,399
there's a small

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,520
skull

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,280
yeah this is where oil comes from

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,000
a lot of uh biological products

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
organical products have been

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
deteriorating under the ground under the

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,479
big pressure it was becoming into some

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
new and then it became an oil and right

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
now we are producing it so we are

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
producing you don't have to

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
so it is produced in wells in oil wells

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
so we have centrifugal pump

52
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,400
so you see it's rotating this

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
interferable pump

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,360
and through the pipelines it's going

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,599
upwards and it goes into the accounting

56
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,160
node or classically it's

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
these simple pumps which uh move this up

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
and through the pipelines

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
through the measuring devices it all all

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
goes to

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
refining and transportation so this is

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,680
scada where we see

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
this submergible pump and we see

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
how the measurement has been done uh

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,239
this is pumping this pumps and this is

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
measurement device and this is how it

67
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,800
works with all the parameters

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
so from the bottom

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
we have a controller which controls the

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
whole

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
production area okay julia will gather

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,760
on here

73
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,560
[Music]

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,799
a memory card is hidden and i have a

75
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
switch down there do you see the run

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,680
position yeah here's the run position

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
here's the led being little up so the

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
run in the run condition it executes the

79
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,519
software to produce oil

80
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,360
it's a remote

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
so when you switch to proc it stops

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
execution of this program internally

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
right now it's in the remote mode and it

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
controls it remotely through the patch

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
cord and this patch cord goes to the

86
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,519
cyber field

87
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,840
yes to the red corner of the hacker and

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
their main objective is what you are

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
going to do right now remotely we can

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
switch it off or we can pull it down

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
pull it down and then we're going to

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
stop it yes hoorah what do we see we see

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
that this cell have stopped the pumps

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
have stopped

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
the

96
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,358
oil stopped being produced

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,320
it's not produced anymore

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
so in this particular cell

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
as it's supposed to be done by hackers

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
in two and a half days they should stop

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
oil production so julia

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
switch it on

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
you have to switch it on because the

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
indicator is not on okay you have

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
switched it on it became wide the scheme

106
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,320
started operating pumps started working

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,720
the valve has been closed so like a

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
shake

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,170
you have launched our big field

110
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,429
[Music]

111
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,440
we already had a cell with the

112
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
centrifugal pumps

113
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
well the oil can be produced not only on

114
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
land but also in the ocean so this is a

115
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
drilling rig and from these drilling

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
rigs with the help of

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,840
you see there's a lot of useful

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
things that live in the sea in addition

119
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
to the oil what else can you find here

120
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
i think it's the same thing but one is

121
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,960
greek another is roman possibly possibly

122
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
but there's also some fish that can be

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
cut you see we have a fissure which

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
catches the fish so the sea

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280
is a path through which oil is being

126
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
transported

127
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
so we have a tanker and pipeline which

128
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
moves into another direction you have a

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
question you can ask it

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
well

131
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,280
and you cannot do it it's a selfie in a

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
dangerous place it's very dangerous to

133
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
your life well looking at this t-shirt

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
there's nothing dangerous about that but

135
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,120
well nevertheless let's go back to oil

136
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,919
transportation

137
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
after production oil is being

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
transported through the pipeline or

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,880
railroad transportation it's been pumped

140
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
from the storage facility

141
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,880
oil tankers

142
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
yeah here it is we see the railroad

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
transportation being used for the oil

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
transportation they are being refilled

145
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,560
right now

146
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
and this is uh

147
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,800
filling station for the railroad

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
thanks and this is a pumping station

149
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
you see there are pumps and in

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
cross-section you can see how these

151
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,639
pumps are pumping oil to the pipeline

152
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
okay let's go back to the

153
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
tanks in the background

154
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,120
can you show the scada and controller to

155
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
the viewers so we have scanner which

156
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,960
controls everything let's look at it

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,720
so this fleet is controlled by this

158
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
particular scada and this particular

159
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
controller

160
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,440
from snyder electric

161
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
this is

162
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
the park we can see the tank fleet

163
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
however

164
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
we had something similar last year we

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,360
also had a storage and

166
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
the oil has been pumped but this year we

167
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
have improved

168
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
and we have brought it closer to reality

169
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,919
everything that we've done in the field

170
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
and we have added another controller

171
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,280
with yellow light siemens 2000 but with

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
litter f it's anti-emergency production

173
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
it's the controller

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,919
which prevents

175
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
accidents that might happen in the

176
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,440
production facility so it works together

177
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
with the main one but it controls only

178
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,319
critical levels but where the accidents

179
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,160
can happen because the main processes

180
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,639
are controlled by the main controller

181
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
so right now we are going to ask julia

182
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,280
okay i will do it but you

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
you're going to speak and i will do

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
should i transfer oil from these tanks

185
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
outside

186
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,519
to the remote ones

187
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
i see

188
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,159
and these red things on top these are

189
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
balls

190
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,560
this is the breathing fall

191
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,959
problems so right now we'll try to show

192
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
all of this

193
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
we are not going to have the overflow of

194
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,120
the oil so let's look at the scada

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
together with the viewers because

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
in scada the anti-emergency protection

197
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,440
will work and it's not going to let us

198
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
to make this overflow

199
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
so we've done it in order

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
to avoid uh the attack against this

201
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
controller so what do we do well on this

202
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,200
screen you have to open these valves

203
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,560
and transfer

204
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,000
your the screen is too reflective i

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
cannot see the button right now

206
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,279
i'll switch it into the manual control

207
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
mode

208
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
so right now transfer it's cutter to the

209
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
manual operational mode

210
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,160
so nothing is happening right now

211
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,040
so the valves

212
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
which are located here they are closed

213
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
so we open the valve you see the bottom

214
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,160
open close so right now

215
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
the oil is being filled

216
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
so you see that numbers are growing

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,560
these numbers growing the number

218
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
well nothing happens there

219
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
emergency is being shown but when

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,680
something will happen we'll come to the

221
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
emergency level and this small log

222
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
emergency shut down

223
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
the water is not going to overflow the

224
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,120
yellow helper right now it became red

225
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
like as if this is critical level

226
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
emergency shutdown

227
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,680
the emergency shutdown should

228
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
become operated and it's not going to

229
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
allow for the oil to be spilled you see

230
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,360
overflow protection has worked and this

231
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
emergency valve has worked and

232
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
everything was disconnected so you see

233
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
the protection by second controller was

234
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,320
stopped it has disconnected the valve

235
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,959
and the overflow didn't happen didn't

236
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,000
happen

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,800
okay let's do the overflow

238
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
logically what should be done in order

239
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,040
to make an overflow

240
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,839
will you be able to

241
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,680
disconnect those two cables

242
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,719
by your molecule

243
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,480
so what have we done right now we are

244
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,519
going to disconnect esd

245
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,320
this is that controller

246
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,760
there's a small button press it press

247
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,279
and press it and pull it in different

248
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,680
directions pull it pull it pull it sure

249
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
sure yes yes

250
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
nothing bad you see all the lamps and

251
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,279
the controller

252
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,839
have been shut down and on scada it

253
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
tells us that

254
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
emergency shutdown system has been

255
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
disconnected doesn't work anymore so

256
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
right now

257
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,560
we can try to open valves manually

258
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
you want to press okay please

259
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,360
so this is a pop-up menu let's not press

260
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
anything so what do we see is d as

261
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
disconnected anything system is not

262
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
protected and as soon as you will pass

263
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
it the overflow will happen there yeah

264
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
open it what

265
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
yeah

266
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
well it's going to switch okay right now

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
it's going to the film mode

268
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,920
let's go and look at the tank right now

269
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,839
because right now we have switched

270
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,160
overflow without protection and right

271
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,880
now the pump is going to uh fill this

272
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
thing continuously

273
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
because the anti overflow controller has

274
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
been disconnected by us and you will

275
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,839
look at the level and you will tell us

276
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,519
how much is left

277
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
well

278
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,639
you can speed it up

279
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,360
instead of 400 you can put 800.

280
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,839
just look at it don't do anything 500

281
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,440
900 yes

282
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
okay let's video the tank

283
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
up jew levels will start screaming okay

284
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,760
well you will see yellow okay let's look

285
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
when julie will scream red

286
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,399
few seconds left

287
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,639
yes

288
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
everything became red and we have to

289
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,079
switch on the overflow the whole cell

290
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,519
will become overflowing

291
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,160
you see what happens we see a certain

292
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
wave

293
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
delivery has been supplied

294
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,440
the level is growing

295
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
well i'm telling you about this sample

296
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
so right now it leaves the top gray

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
level

298
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,279
so what is going to happen with those

299
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,079
pumps when several megawatts of pumps

300
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,760
are

301
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
pushing this

302
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,680
so the

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,440
oxygen is also been pressed out of this

304
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
well these are not just simple oil

305
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
products this is a

306
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,900
[Music]

307
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,600
so speaking about this one

308
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
in storage comparison to the previous

309
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
year

310
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,639
controller anti-fraud

311
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,480
well they need to make an overflow like

312
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
in the last year but they also need

313
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
julia they need to get around the second

314
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,839
controller and they should achieve this

315
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
result

316
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,519
they need an insider i was insiders

317

[Music]

318
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
on

319
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
we should make an accident like last

320
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,600
year but after you have put the power on

321
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
and the pass will go into

322
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
overflow protection

323
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,519
mode and for

324
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,160
you hackers

325
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,199
lamps are on esd became green the valve

326
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,519
came to the safe position and the tank

327
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,639
is under protection of

328
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,600
anti-explosive automatics
