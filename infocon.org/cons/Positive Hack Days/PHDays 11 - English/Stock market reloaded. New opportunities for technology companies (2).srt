3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
we are at the investor

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
section

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,519
new opportunities for investment it's

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,119
not traditional

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,960
for positive hack days

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
it's an event about cyber security

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
and everything around it but

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
this time

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,360
on these positive hack days we wanted to

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
add

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,440
the section about investment stock

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
market and the reason is quite clear

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,440
last time positive wasn't a public

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
company

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
but in december last year we had an ipo

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,719
in the moscow stock exchange it's now a

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
continuous topic for us investments

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
stock market

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,559
today

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
we have several people invited

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,479
speakers

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,360
let's start with evgeny kogan

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,200

[Music]

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,759
all of them are respected people

29
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
veterans of the stock market analysts

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,119
so

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,079
we have a good panel today let me begin

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
with the first subject

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,439
which

34
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,158
is a little confrontational

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
ipo

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
it so happened that positive

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
technologies was the last russian

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,759
companies to do the ipo to become a

39
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
public company it happened in december

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
2021

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
since then

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,960
uh

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
for almost six months

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,920
we didn't have any more ipos the

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
question to the panel is what is

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,479
happening

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,959
uh does it mean that ipos have entered

48
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
in russia or are there some other

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
factors which delay ipos now the

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
question is to anton

51
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,760
what do you think

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
thank you maxime

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,520
well

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
honestly the world

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,040
is divided

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,360
into two periods before february 24 and

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
after

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,110
february 24.

59
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,239
[Music]

60
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
the greater part of the russian free

61
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,200
float is in the

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
hands of the foreign investors

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,599
the share of

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,120
retail

65
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
investors is growing we had a lot of

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
foreigners and still have them

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
so the market was driven by

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
foreign investors

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
this factor

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
because of the events that you know

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
has come to an end but on the other hand

72
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
the russian market

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,159
doesn't stand still

74
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,360
it has been coming for a long

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
time

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
a little before your event

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,760
the saint petersburg

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
stock exchange became public we couldn't

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
imagine it three years ago or ten years

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
ago

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
we didn't imagine that

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,519
oh

83
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,200
we can have a deal for 175

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
million dollars

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
through retail

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,519
it was difficult to imagine but now

87
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
russian market

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
is retail driven

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
the trade in the moscow

90
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
stock exchange

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120
are provided by retail investors

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
and obviously

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
this is

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
a good

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
foundation basis for

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
the deals like sbb

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
stock exchange it's difficult to

98
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,160
er imagine when it can happen

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
but it will happen one day i'm

100
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,360
absolutely sure it's a matter of time

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,230
now vladimir the question is to you

102
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,600
[Music]

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,479
you are more related to

104
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
institutional investors and funds

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
what do you think is

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,840
the

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
lack of institutional investors the main

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,400
factor is the retail king now

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,479
i believe

110
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,440
we don't have ipos not because of the

111
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
lack of ipo

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
institutional investors

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
so we all try to find where

114
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,000
the

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
balance is not only in russia but

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
worldwide i believe we believe in the

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360
second or third quarter uh it will be

118
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
clear where the balance is

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
which companies are better which are

120
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
worse we didn't have a lot of

121
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,120
institutional investors locally we had

122
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,520
western funds mainly but those western

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
funds were filled by

124
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
russian capitals

125
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
which returned to russia through the

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
western funds now

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,520
this flow is much limited

128
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
we need a few quarters

129
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,080
for the russian capital to flow into the

130
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
local

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
institutional investors and come back to

132
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
the stock market

133
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,440
will it happen will it be more than

134
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,400
before less than before it's too early

135
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
to say we can expect that we shall have

136
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
even more capital than before

137
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,680
because the uh capital that fled from

138
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
russia didn't only come back to russia

139
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
it also

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,319
spread across the international stock

141
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,759
markets and now that the russian money

142
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
doesn't go away

143
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,199
it

144
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,919
we

145
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,520
may expect

146
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
bigger volumes than before

147
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,479
but now the landscape is unclear

148
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,840
uh any evaluation of the company is an

149
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
evaluation of the future now it's very

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,400
difficult to evaluate the future because

151
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
the situation changes every day and

152
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
every hour and people are cautious now

153
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
evgeny

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
the only thing to add

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,440
is that much depends on the paradigm of

156
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
our general development of the country

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,120
and economy and where to take resources

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,000
for development i think common sense

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,039
will prevail and we shall understand

160
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
that without market economy we cannot do

161
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,680
and stock market is the only

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
tool

163
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,280
to attract finances for development

164
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,440
of economy of business and so on also

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,479
i'm

166
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,440
looking at alternatives we have a lot of

167
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,720
people with the money with a lot of

168
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
money

169
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,000
they are concentrated at one or two

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
percent of population but it's a

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
different thing and nevertheless

172
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,440
we have a lot of money in the camp in

173
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,520
the country a lot of corporations

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
who have a lot of liquidity

175
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,000
and they have to sell

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,919
dollars and euro

177
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,960
get rubles and where to

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
send the rubles the company do

179
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,360
m a

180
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,240
uh

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
we see that they buy and buy

182
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
home credit bank and we are at the

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,719
beginning of the process what is next

184
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
those corporations will go to the market

185
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
and people from those company come to me

186
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,880
and say this is the market what to buy

187
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
a lot of questions

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
and one more important point

189
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
the financial market is all about

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
transparency about reporting about

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
understanding of the company and its

192
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,760
future if you analyze you have to

193
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,959
analyze and not just guess

194
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
if some

195
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
companies

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,519
remain in non-transparent

197
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
the investor will look at transparent

198
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,720
companies only and if people are clever

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
and say that we are transparent

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
everything is clear we have a lot of

201
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,440
money that company is doomed to success

202
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,920
as for our local closed sandbox

203
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
russian stock market it's a local small

204
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,800
sandbox i don't know who is going to

205
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,519
sell

206
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,880
who will go from their gdrs what is next

207
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
where to spend the money and they they

208
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,360
are looking for interesting stories

209
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
every day

210
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,800
despite international collisions and

211
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,440
the world will be very hot in the near

212
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
future our market can demonstrate fine

213
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
phenomenal growth because there are

214
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
there is no alternative

215
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
it's an interesting subject but if we

216
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
look at a different

217
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
area

218
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,640
investors funds

219
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,399
what about companies that would like to

220
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
go to their

221
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,240
stock market

222
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
are there such companies alina did you

223
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
talk to such companies the companies who

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,079
would like to do the ipo

225
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,360
do such companies come to you

226
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
saying we want to be public

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
right now

228
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,120
honestly

229
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
everyone put

230
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,399
those

231
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,839
strategies on hold yes the sandbox is

232
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,880
small

233
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,760
but we look at the global situation as

234
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
well the global ipo market

235
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,839
in q1 is minus

236
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
72 percent

237
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
it's not about russia it's about

238
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,119
u.s

239
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,399
a lot of companies delay their ipos

240
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
because of the pandemics because of the

241
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,079
inflation

242
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,839
because of the

243
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,120
um helicopter money which were

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
invested in retail

245
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
then

246
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,040
february 24 as well

247
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,720
so it's too early to discuss

248
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,839
now

249
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
who is ready

250
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,120
who is not

251
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
chuck

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,040
for who is ready for the ipo

253
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,880
the process of ipo preparation doesn't

254
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,120
take a month or two it takes much longer

255
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
it requires the change of the company

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
dna

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
one thing is when you are private the

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
other thing when you are public

259
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,399
and the process of dna change takes a

260
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
lot of time

261
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,279
a lot of processes a lot of structural

262
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,560
changes

263
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
a lot of changes and corporate

264
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
management transparency which evgeny

265
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
mentioned

266
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,760
and the question of market is secondary

267
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,720
now as soon as the uh

268
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
windows of opportunity

269
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
will be open

270
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,040
when we

271
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,760
realize where we're all moving

272
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,200
we are moving and the market is moving

273
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,639
the latest statistics says that everyone

274
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,160
went to cash

275
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,400
and everyone sits with cash and

276
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,959
[Music]

277
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
to see what is going to happen and where

278
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
to deploy such cash

279
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
so before we realize that it's difficult

280
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
to say

281
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
on the one hand we have a lot of money

282
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
the money which is looking for

283
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
investments

284
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
they are in the cash format on the other

285
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,800
hand

286
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
the companies

287
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
cannot do the ipo because they don't

288
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
have reliability transparency and

289
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,040
stability

290
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
to invest

291
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,240
so this is a disbalance a lot of money

292
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
but no one is going to

293
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
invest is that right

294
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,079
i would put it this way exactly because

295
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,240
now really

296
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
taken taking into account the

297
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
instability and

298
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,000
um

299
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,040
you can see what happens with the

300
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
u.s stock markets

301
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
tech stocks

302
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,600
so the expectation of communities not to

303
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,959
grow but to save

304
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,440
power industry banking

305
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,160
is

306
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,519
something that the investors could

307
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,600
invest

308
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,800
but all trends are temporary

309
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,480
whenever something is going to change we

310
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
can

311
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,800
see a lot of

312
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
transformation

313
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,160
look how fast we overcame

314
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,959
the pandemic

315
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
within a year or two

316
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,560
the companies that were ready and use

317
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
the opportunity the windows or

318
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
opportunity

319
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
they can be

320
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
applauded okay especially

321
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,519
i heard a lot of things recently about

322
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,720
how to

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,519
evaluate the company

324
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,320
the approaches and methodologies

325
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
through multiplier through dcfs and

326
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
other

327
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
interesting terms no longer work and the

328
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,959
question is to dmitry who is a

329
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,240
professional analyst is that right

330
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
are we now in

331
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
in the area of uncertainty how to

332
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
evaluate the company how to invest or

333
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,199
not to invest i think that standard

334
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,680
methodologies didn't go

335
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,399
there are different modes of operation

336
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
in the market people look only at local

337
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,959
conditions like the russian market they

338
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,240
look at the

339
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
global situation internationally

340
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,839
worldwide we see much fewer ipos than

341
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,880
before

342
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,399
and liquidity goes out of the market why

343
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
why ipos grew

344
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
because

345
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
money was printed

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
we had too much money and it was very

347
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,320
good to do ipo because the money was

348
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,440
there and the company collected

349
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
that money and the companies were ready

350
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,560
to pay to get a lot of money

351
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,279
so this bubble

352
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,759
no longer exists

353
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
but what about russia

354
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,560
of course one of the methods

355
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
was is broken the dividend method most

356
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
of the companies refuse to pay the

357
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,800
dividends because of the uncertainty

358
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,399
they are not

359
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,199
sure what is going to happen in future

360
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,279
although they don't know where to spend

361
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,560
the money

362
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,638
import has shrunk

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
at the growth

365
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
mode we cannot say that in a month's

366
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,880
time the company will cost

367
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
that much so

368
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,240
two to three years what we need for

369
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
fundamental non-technical investment to

370
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,560
realize what is the addressable market

371
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,839
what the company can do who are the

372
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,480
competitors

373
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
how they

374
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,240
correlate in terms of products and on

375
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,199
that basis we can evaluate what kind of

376
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,399
money a capital flow

377
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
it may have can it

378
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,599
earn the money or will it work at a loss

379
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
it's a long-term story you can never

380
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,439
expect fast results from the market so

381
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,679
the only method which is broken is uh

382
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
method of evaluation by dividends

383
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
so many of us are long-term investments

384
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,559
for many

385
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,760
russian

386
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,000
to say nothing of foreign companies

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,720
but that is off topic

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,559
you wanted to comment yes

389
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,559
the situation is difficult

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,559

russia

395
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,880
and now the market has to find

396
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
alternative providers

397
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
of

398
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,440
information systemic information of

399
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
course some people get

400
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,440
data from vpn through vpn

401
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
but we must find alternative sources

402
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
to get

403
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,000
to come to a consensus about foreign

404
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
assets

405
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,679
then transparency

406
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
now we have a trend

407
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,760
uh the other way around and we

408
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,559
understand why the companies do not

409
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,000
disclose data about themselves or they

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,640
disclose only a small part of that

411
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
information we have a story that

412
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,200
foreign banks stopped covering russian

413
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
companies

414
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,440
and analytics russian analysts

415
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
see that it's more difficult to work

416
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,640
because they cannot make a call and get

417
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,280
all the data they need how to build the

418
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
consensus it's a big question

419
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,160
next problem is

420
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
that the

421
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,039
trades in the moscow stock market could

422
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,679
look different if assets were sold

423
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,840
in

424
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,000
foreign stock exchanges then

425
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
of course

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
the in the current

uncertain situations

428
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,039
with greater disc discount you could

429
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
still sell

430
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
russian internet

431
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,559
was sold at the level of foreign analogs

432
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,440
and other companies sold at a discount

433
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
the russian discount how to define the

434
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
russian discount now

435
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,720
it's a very big question

436
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
the situation is developing it's

437
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
changing the number of problems will be

438
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,240
overcome but how to evaluate it's a

439
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,799
non-trivial question and as we started

440
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
talking about ipo

441
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
classically

442
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,679
in ipo there is stage 1 after the

443
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,559
announcement

444
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,760
there is a process of remarketing

445
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
and now

446
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,080
the audience

447
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,880
that

448
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,679
where you can be talked where we can

449
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,200
talk about evaluation was reduced to

450
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,559
about

i believe that the market will find

459
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,760
answers to all the questions yes we'll

460
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
touch upon that question a little later

461
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
yes i would like to add i would like to

462

divide

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
the situation between short-term and

464
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
longer term in the short term we shall

465
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
see who is going to survive and who is

466
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,400
not

467
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
and then

468
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
move the money from one pocket to

469
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,240
another if we look further on

470
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,400
the classical methods seemed to go but

471
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
they didn't go they stay with us

472
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,799
because

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,440
our

474

dcfs and models and multipliers

475
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
will still stay

476
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,760
but in the near future i think

477
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
the we shall have two methods

478
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
the first one

479
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,320
is the

480
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
method of simple alternative we have

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,159
interest rate deposits

it's the price of the money

484
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,200
we'll do it simpler and second

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,960
by the government for it companies

526
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
accordingly the question is

527
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,720
do you think

528
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,000
i t companies

529
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,919
do they need ipo at all

530
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,559
with all that kind of support you can

531
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,760
take

532
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,559
money in the banks and develop

533
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
without ipos

534
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,039
so vladimir can you say what do you

535
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
think

536
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,000
well the stock markets are not only

537
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
money for the companies money can be

538
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
obtained

539
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,640
in different ways and sometimes cheaper

540
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
than in the stock market stock market is

541
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,559
transparency stability demonstration

542
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,240
of the company that it works that it's

543
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,240
not about an owner that it as such

544
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,520
occupies a certain place in the market

545
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,799
and

546
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,520
it's evaluated

547
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
it's a classical example of business

548
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,520
development in russia many businesses

549
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,840
are built by one person

550
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,240
one owner we have a lot of companies who

551
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,360
do not grow when the owner stops dealing

552
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,159
with it sometimes the company is closed

553
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,320
when the owner is no longer interested

554
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,600
in it but the task is to build

555
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,880
a lot of independent businesses which

556
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,679
will stay in the market and grow even if

557
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,400
the founder goes away

558
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,960
the more companies of that kind we have

559
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
the more stable economy we're going to

560
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,400
have we're too young

561
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,919
no we don't have many companies

562
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,039
who

563
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,320
are

564
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
available for stock marketing because we

565
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,720
need at least uh one billion dollar of

566
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,760
capital uh for the

567
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,320
stock exchange to be interested and for

568
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,400
the companies to be interested in stock

569
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
exchange when we have more such

570
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,080
companies we could say that it market is

571
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,799
stable because now we say we have brains

572
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,679
we have i.t companies but the industry

573
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,400
the iit industries as an institution is

574
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
too young

575
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
we have too few public companies we must

576
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,760
have dozens of them

577
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
and they support measures offered by the

578
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
government

579
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,360
are quite positive

580
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,320
free

581
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
money sometimes interest free

582
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,799
client

583
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,360
access to customers

584
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,799
we hope

585
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,039
that

586
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,080
as a result large players will grow in

587
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,559
the market

588
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,520
it's important that companies

589
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,360
should

590
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,919
be able to survive because quite often

591
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,919
the government uh is kind of over

592
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,880
feeding them but nevertheless we already

593
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
see an example such as the ministry of

594
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,760
free industry and uh trades the way it

595
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,760
works

596
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,159
uh just to

597
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,640
finish up about today's situation and

598
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,559
prospects for the ipo market for the

599
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,919
next few years i think russia has more

600
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
chances to build a large iit company

601
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
that can become a public company that

602
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
could be valued at let's say a billion

603
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,559
dollars

604
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,240
in the past a lot of ita subs sectors

605
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,640
were occupied by western vendors and it

606
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
was very difficult to push them out

607
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
to compete with them

608
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,919
so everybody knows sap microsoft oracle

609
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,159
and the only thing that was left for

610
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,840
russian startups was to develop some

611
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,480
niche products and so to do something

612
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,279
better than sap let's say but in a

613
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,399
niche segment but

614
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,799
if you're going to make a vertically

615
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,919
integrated solution then you get

616
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,120
the volume the size you can

617
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,480
get the value of a

618
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
billion

619
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
and now we see a lot of niches have

620
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,240
become free

621
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,279
because

622
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,320
of

623
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
foreign vendors

624
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,559
uh went away

625
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
the cyber security sphere is quite

626
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,279
interesting because there is some

627
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,120
specificity in the high level of

628
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,399
regulations

629
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
this story

630
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,919
happened a little bit earlier i mean the

631
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,600
loss of trust to

632
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
western vendors because the government

633
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,559
was

634
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,679
requiring

635
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,760
requiring

636
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,919
import substitution so i think positive

637
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,919
happens a bit earlier

638
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,880
than companies in other

639
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,960
sectors

640
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
so we'll hope for that in other 80 sub

641
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,559
sectors

642
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
similar large vendors will emerge

643
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,320
not necessarily in cyber security but in

644
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,640
some other areas which can become public

645
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,120
based on what eugene said

646
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,000
it says the market economy is going to

647
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,799
stay maybe within different boundaries

648
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,279
but it will be here and the investors

649
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,000
will

650
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,760
come moving here

651
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
thank you

652
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,960
i would just like

653
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,720
to add a couple of words to what my

654
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
colleague said today we need to look for

655
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,320
any traditional and non-traditional ways

656
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,120
to

657
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,679
incentivize our employees in addition to

658
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,080
what we're saying about capitalization

659
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,039
and attracting uh funding through ipo

660
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,919
and other things look today or we what

661
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,640
we have uh is our brains and our people

662
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
and we need to make it so that people

663
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,960
should stay so what can we do pay them

664
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,720
200 000 300 000 400 000 any

665
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,399
normal professional

666
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,279
uh

667
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,000
you know operator can give them 500 and

668
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,720
600 but if you offer them options uh

669
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,559
some shares and make them uh

670
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,919
participants

671
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,320
co-creators that would be much more

672
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,159
interesting for them

673
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,360
so i think that today the

674
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,799
uh market mechanism uh that allows an

675
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,720
employee uh to become part of the

676
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,799
business is perhaps one of the most

677
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,000
important tools that will uh make people

678
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,240
think twice whether to leave or not to

679
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
leave

680
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,360
if a person has an incentive you can

681
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,640
sit in honduras but keep working on your

682
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,120
russian business so look

683
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
you've

684
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,279
added a subject that i would like

685
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,080
to address how to enter the stock market

686
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,799
stock exchange and we mentioned the

687
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,240
traditional

688
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
approach

689
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,679
traditional ipos positive

690
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,320
uh went through a direct placement but

691
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,399
we understand that direct placements

692
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,440
worldwide is not an exclusive case i

693
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,080
think spotify also

694
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,640
went to the exchange through direct

695
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
placement how do you think in the

696
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
current

697
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,159
russian realities the stock exchange

698
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
stock market or

699
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,919
considering all the limitations that you

700
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,000
mentioned

701
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,440
is there

702
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,399
some

703
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,600
one traditional way or direct placement

704
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,360
do they make it

705
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,600
more attractive

706
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,240
or uh they pursue different

707
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,799
goals and it makes no sense so to

708
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,799
compare them i'll ask alina to comment

709
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,720
and maybe dimitri in that time yes

710
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,200
indeed the subject is quite interesting

711
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,559
and in fact

712
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,360
the

713
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,480
tech segment is a driver of all

714
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,760
animations

715
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,960
that's happening in the cm market

716
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,519
the tech sector

717
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,360
actually

718
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,000
invented the direct placement

719
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,360
that the american exchange

720
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,519
approved then

721
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,720
in the beginning of 2021

722
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,080
the

723
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
direct placement

724
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,918
was

725
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,480
first used

726
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,840
so primary

727
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
investments the tech sector

728
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,039
was the one

729
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,679
that invented hybrid auctions that we

730
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,360
haven't yet seen in this country in

731
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
terms of uh pricing

732
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
the dutch auctions

733
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,279
went to prices have been fixed uh by

734
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,120
underwriters uh rather than uh banks

735
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,919
investors in defining that price the

736
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,279
tech uh center uh sector uh

737
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,240
also initiated uh

738
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,360
the

739
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,960
lock up

740
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,279
band

741
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,120
so

742
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
that's the

743
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,120
uh

744
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
so

745
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,440
therefore

746
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
there are a lot of

747
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
options

748
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,679
and the options

749
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,440
that unfortunately

750
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,679
have not yet been used

751
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,000
in this country

752
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,720
before this uh meeting i looked up uh

753
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,159
the statistic for 2021.

754
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
so in the us last year more than a

755
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,159
thousand ipo happens and only seven

756
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,320
of them were in the direct listening

757
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,679
format so this tool even if

758
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,720
it is so

759
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,519
attractive is not used very broadly

760
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,679
even today it hasn't been uh

761
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,600
proven uh that

762
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,399
using the auction uh during the book

763
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,120
building uh phase that gives you any

764
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,799
advantages because in one case it

765
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,519
gave a positive result in the other case

766
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,120
it

767
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
brought the price down so there's no

768
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,440
mathematical way to prove it

769
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,559
the

770
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,039
elegance of my business and

771
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,279
my

772
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,640
area of expertise

773
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,519
is that

774
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,360
there's no standard solution

775
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,080
there's no one-size-fits-all and based

776
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,799
on your experience you can always find

777
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,440
something that fits your situation

778
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,279
and when positive technologies uh was

779
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,719
going direct listing we were watching it

780
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,440
uh quite closely because you kind of

781
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,760
created new presidents

782
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,000
so just like lawyers will work on a

783
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
president basis

784
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,960
so in fact there are a lot of

785
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,239
opportunities

786
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,800
and i'm hoping that the conditions that

787
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,159
we have now

788
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
coming back to the government support

789
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,079
question

790
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,599
will push

791
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,560
on a regulatory level uh the market not

792
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,520
only

793
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,119
uh to create special conditions uh like

794
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,679
achieve mortgages high salaries but

795
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
maybe it will become a leap that will

796
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,719
help us

797
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,879
develop further in terms of financial

798
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,839
tools because moscow stock exchange

799
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,839
made a colossal

800
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,079
jump in its development in terms of

801
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,000
access infrastructure

802
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,680
is

803
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,560
second to none uh taken

804
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,920
they are taking the new york frankfurt

805
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,320
or london exchange

806
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,359
and

807
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,720
amsterdam exchange suddenly popped up

808
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,960
last year

809
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
there's a different story

810
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,240
it's a separate story why

811
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,599
of all countries

812
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
so i think that in order to bring all

813
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
this stock market up

814
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,960
and come back to the market

815
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
situation

816
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,119
we need to create new tools or at least

817
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,359
to use the tools that already

818
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,240
exist worldwide but within other

819
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,800
limitations in the current regulations

820
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,440
are not being used in this country so

821
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,800
far

822
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,320
what do you think

823
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
spo ipo

824
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,040
ipo direct listing

825
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
you have to understand what an ipo is

826
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,119
in general because worldwide an ipo is a

827
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,560
huge event

828
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,520
is

829
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,920
a lot of people involved a lot of people

830
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,280
are being hired analysts going across

831
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,359
all the different rich

832
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,000
foundations and funds uh to appear the

833
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,320
company so it's a fully fledged pr event

834
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,040
this is the most

835
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
the biggest difference between an ipo

836
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
and direct listing

837
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,160
uh also in one point is that ipo uh is

838
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
about a certain set of rules that the

839
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,440
company uh agrees to observe so you

840
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,359
can't go away from these rules for

841
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,960
instance regarding the price that you're

842
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,160
going to

843
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,200
place

844
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,640
so this pr campaign is exactly to

845
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,200
determine that price that would fit the

846
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
range of estrous to

847
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,680
company management that's a big event

848
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,320
the restless thing is a faster approach

849
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
is a cheaper approach

850
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,720
but

851
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,000
is an approach that has less certainty

852
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
the company doesn't know whether the

853
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,720
people will start buying the shares or

854
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
maybe uh will have to

855
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,079
sell a herobrine chef it

856
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,960
may become absolutely uninteresting to

857
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,760
the

858
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,520
management and then they will have to do

859
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,119
something to

860
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,079
take

861
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,480
release the shares

862
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,320
actually

863
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,000
this is something

864
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,119
really

865
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,400
in contradiction what you're saying

866
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,560
about uncertainty so

867
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,760
what

868
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
is the evaluation based usually it's

869
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,079
based on

870
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,079
the analyst research but it's not just

871
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,560
research it's called deal research

872
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
but if there's no deal

873
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
in direct placement and direct placement

874
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,640
there's no deal then there's no research

875
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,160
and if there's no research there's no

876
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,920
valuation so what kind of a price point

877
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,839
a company should

878
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,240
come to an exchange stock exchange so

879
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,560
this is really our case and we had to

880
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,800
based on the opinion of analysts that

881
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
are not institutional but based on a

882
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,400
certain community of analysts to draw up

883
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,920
some initial price to start trading

884
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,760
from that price and i mentioned this to

885
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,839
confirm your statement that direct

886
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,040
placement

887
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,160
has a lot of uncertainty about it

888
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,960
let me just add a bit it's exactly the

889
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,800
debate that is going on in the united

890
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,839
states in terms of using direct listing

891
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,000
this is basically what it's all about

892
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,880
because

893
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,040
in direct listing you don't have

894
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,480
due diligence uh that

895
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,520
uh is usually a run uh to define the

896
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,320
valuation and it's kind of broader than

897
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,640
uh the valuation as such uh but

898
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,040
it's the fact that during the price

899
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,280
setting in the in the ipo there are

900
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,680
banks that also carry responsibility for

901
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,240
the disclosure of risks that

902
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,320
apply to the company and the industry

903
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,880
that investors need to pay attention to

904
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,359
in direct listing this information is

905
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,560
presented

906
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,119
in a much sparser format

907
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,200
so therefore indeed it's not a simple

908
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,960
question what's better which of the two

909
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,920
is better

910
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,800
it's clear that even in direct listing

911
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,280
if we take international practice

912
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,520
you still

913
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,119
not an underwriter but a financial

914
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,119
consultant that helps you

915
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,480
arrive at some uh pricing even uh though

916
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,599
even though it's based on a

917
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,359
smaller selection

918
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,040
in terms of deal research but

919
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,760
nevertheless uh it is a justified

920
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
valuation it's not just like you come

921
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,400
and say i cost a hundred dollars

922
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,480
because then uh the trade starts

923
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,440
happening and then the security can go

924
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,920
down yeah we've seen examples of that

925
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,599
well frankly

926
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,920
well uh happily we

927
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,240
were able uh to

928
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,079
uh avoid this

929
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,160
firstly i'd like to say that it all uh

930
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,640
was invented by churchill in 1918 and

931
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,760
secondly if anyone remember the initial

932
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,280
phase of creating the russian stock

933
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,839
market when we were all running about

934
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,079
regions and were paying cash for these

935
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,160
shares and then brought them to the

936
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,319
stock exchange it was the direct listing

937
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,160
uh in its exact shape uh we uh brought a

938
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,560
lot of companies to listing in the 90s

939
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,599
in the

940
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,720
northeast

941
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,599
and this is the way the russian

942
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,960
stock markets uh emerged i remember i

943
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
came to boris titov and said boris you

944
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
have a great company abroad you saw yes

945
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,200
let's bring it to the uh stock market

946
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,160
others do direct listing and we did it

947
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,400
and our bro is now being listed

948
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,960
uh why am i mentioning it this is not

949
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
there is nothing new about this and in

950
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,319
reality you understand that a colleague

951
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,359
was

952
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,839
very right in saying that an ipo

953
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,079
is a very expensive uh activity i would

954
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,839
even say that it was goldman sachs so

955
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,599
who invited it to earn a lot of money

956
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,440
where i was just waiting for someone to

957
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,119
mention this

958
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,839
greedy banks who are to blame yes it's

959
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,920
lobby what do you always say i think

960
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,319
that in the current conditions

961
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,960
i think the new version of an ipo

962
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
uh with

963
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,319
a narrow circle of institutional

964
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,800
investors from whom you can get feedback

965
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,520
on

966
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,480
on

967
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
the evaluation it brings the

968
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,160
ipo closer to direct listing in fact the

969
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,480
difference is not that big if you have

970
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,400
50 or 100 feedback lines this

971
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,599
is

972
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,040
a source of more or less reliable

973
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,440
information if you only have five or so

974
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,160
then uh you don't you're not getting

975
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,560
comparable a comparable

976
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
advantage uh compared to direct listing

977
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,640
on the other one hand it's always

978
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,960
difficult to be the first

979
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,200
you

980
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,280
in uh the newest history that we have uh

981
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,079
were the ones uh to come first to take

982
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,040
up this challenge and you succeeded yes

983
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
it's clear that for you

984
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,079
direct listing

985
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,040
is not going to stay in parity

986
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,440
uh with ipo as a tool but it's quite

987
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,400
possible that the specific weight of

988
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,040
direct listings in russia will be higher

989
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,119
at least for the next couple of stages

990
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,119
of development because alina is quite

991
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,200
right saying that indeed there are very

992
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,240
few companies in the u.s direct listing

993
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,359
is done by companies that you don't need

994
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,440
to sell to banks they sell themselves

995
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,200
quite well and there's another factor in

996
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,960
the russian market direct listing in

997
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,560
russia i mean it's uh good for you to

998
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,920
speak about yourself because you have a

999
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
growth of 30 to 50 and the margin quite

1000
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
good and you're paying out dividend but

1001
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
there are not too many companies like

1002
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,800
that in the market and it's clear that

1003
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,839
the success of direct listing

1004
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,720
directly depends uh on the history of

1005
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,160
the company as such

1006
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
because for a retail investor it's quite

1007
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,480
possible they have an opportunity of

1008
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,960
going and buying uh shares of other

1009
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,400
companies that they must exchange so

1010
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,240
they can go and buy american uh shares

1011
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,000
saying petersburg exchange hong kong is

1012
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,440
going to join

1013
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,480
so the competition has not gone away

1014
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,760
it's there and you need some luck to

1015
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
achieve success but on the whole i think

1016
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,480
the two cases are have come close okay

1017
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
thank you

1018
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,839
our time is running up uh six or seven

1019
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,240
minutes by the way i forgot to mention

1020
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,000
uh to those watching us online that you

1021
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,560
can ask a question if you use the qr

1022
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,200
code here in the backdrop you can ask a

1023
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,839
question in telegram but while we have

1024
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,520
some questions

1025
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,720
from the floor

1026
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,520
uh there's a microphone or

1027
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,880
that you can use to ask the question

1028
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,359
hello i say capital

1029
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,880
stanislav

1030
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
today it has already been mentioned

1031
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,599
about the size of the russian market and

1032
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,400
the estimate that you mentioned will be

1033
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,000
based on the size and dynamic of the

1034
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,800
russian market the second foot

1035
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,760
of positive technologies can it

1036
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,440
can it emerge

1037
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,359
is it possible to talk about expansion

1038
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,440
to other countries what are they have

1039
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,440
you already made any steps to

1040
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,280
expand your sales force in these

1041
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,720
countries and when can we expect the

1042
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
preliminary estimate at least regarding

1043
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,079
the

1044
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,480
targeted market size uh in these

1045
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,839
countries

1046
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,520
yes thank you

1047
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,920
we had a broadcast on radio with evgeny

1048
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,480
and we touched upon this subject yes

1049
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,200
of course positive ambitions

1050
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,079
go beyond russia and have never been

1051
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,160
confined uh

1052
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,520
by in russia the current thing is

1053
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,560
that

1054
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,240
because of the explosive growth of the

1055
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,640
russian cyber security market and

1056
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,880
because the foreign vendors

1057
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,079
left the market a huge market

1058
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,119
has

1059
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,520
come into the hands of the russian

1060
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,119
companies

1061
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,240
we

1062
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
are now getting 100 billion worth

1063
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,680
markets out of the 180 billion worth

1064
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,160
because the foreign vendors have left

1065
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,960
the market so our biggest priority today

1066
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,319
is just to cope with this size as we

1067
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,440
are kind of

1068
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,560
harvesting

1069
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,880
her now how to it's a big challenge for

1070
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,440
us how to cope with this volume talking

1071
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,359
about the international expansion yes of

1072
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,880
course we see ourselves an international

1073
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,640
cyber security

1074
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,839
company

1075
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,880
the markets that we see are let's say

1076
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,440
geopolitically loyal to russia not even

1077
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,160
cis but the countries of asia the gulf

1078
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,720
south america strange as it may seem we

1079
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,079
already have customers from these

1080
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,200
countries

1081
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,520
we directly sell our products in all

1082
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,359
these countries

1083
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,520
and i think that in the coming two or

1084
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,880
three years

1085
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,960
these two percent

1086
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,920
that

1087
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,800
uh

1088
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,119
we have today i mean as a contribution

1089
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,400
of foreign sales uh to uh uh revenue uh

1090
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,440
will turn into double digits and i think

1091
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,319
the next uh year when we're going to by

1092
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,599
the end of this year when we're going to

1093
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,800
define the strategy for the next three

1094
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,160
years we'll be able to share more

1095
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,640
details about this well maybe you have

1096
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,079
some questions

1097
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,160
not regarding positive but

1098
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,319
in

1099
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,720
general regarding the stock market

1100
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,520
can you pass the microphone over please

1101
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,040
thank you

1102
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,640
thank you

1103
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,960
another question to dmitry dimitry you

1104
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,839
said

1105
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,839
that

1106
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,359
today in the russian market

1107
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,920
the whole valuation strategy for

1108
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,599
dividend uh in companies has broken down

1109
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,960
but now

1110
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,400
many companies in this sanctioned

1111
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
condition are hiding their reporting how

1112
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,119
in these conditions when you don't

1113
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,240
really have

1114
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,680
any information

1115
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,440
that gives information from the company

1116
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,200
as such

1117
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,520
how can you evaluate the company in

1118
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,960
terms of prospects or future threats

1119
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,440
thank you i think that professional

1120
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,839
analysts are now in the best position

1121
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,560
possible because these companies have

1122
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,599
taken away even historical reporting and

1123
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,440
we have it all in our models there are

1124
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,319
certain factors firstly you have access

1125
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,160
to investor relations

1126
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,559
they can

1127
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,319
contribute some information

1128
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,000
part of the information can be found in

1129
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,359
open sources

1130
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,160
so

1131
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,359
most of the russian market

1132
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,800
our exporters

1133
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,280
so the dynamic of raw materials the

1134
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,400
sizes

1135
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,280
are the most important factors

1136
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
some analysts

1137
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,920
have a favorite method of looking at how

1138
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,520
similar companies are reporting let's

1139
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
say in the u in the u.s

1140
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,839
and thinking how does it work with

1141
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,000
russian companies it's not all together

1142
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,160
accurate but on the whole

1143
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,760
you can arrive at some estimates of

1144
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,520
course it's not going to be an accurate

1145
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,599
estimates with complete reporting but

1146
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,480
the dynamic can always be derived and

1147
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,079
you can always

1148
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,000
use it to evaluate the company correctly

1149
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,040
question yes

1150
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,559
i have both a commentary question what i

1151
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:25,520
heard

1152
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,920
is that

1153
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,240
is

1154
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
somewhat nervous

1155
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,520
a statement that

1156
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,720
reuters and bloomberg are leaving russia

1157
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,200
being a sign of a dire

1158
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,599
time for us because now

1159
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,720
we

1160
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,680
don't

1161
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,720
have

1162
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,720
a capability

1163
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,160
to

1164
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,880
broadcast the opinions of the russia of

1165
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,559
the foreign participants

1166
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,800
in terms of evaluating russian assets

1167
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,119
here i would like to ask my colleagues a

1168
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,240
question

1169
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,160
how do you believe this problem could be

1170
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,359
bypassed

1171
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,480
uh because uh it exists and

1172
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,359
it looks so likely that we'll have to

1173
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,240
uh deal with that for several years to

1174
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,160
come of course they'll come back

1175
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,559
as the song says but it won't happen

1176
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,720
soon and also i remember the time in

1177
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,839
1990 uh when reuters and bloomberg

1178
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,240
were fully absent from russia but

1179
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,359
nevertheless

1180
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,920
uh major investment banks like flaming

1181
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,240
at that time they emerged after that and

1182
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,319
they were not using this

1183
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,440
these aggregators they did their own

1184
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,559
homework

1185
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,599
to evaluate the companies and it was

1186
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,480
this

1187
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,839
that was

1188
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,319
shaping the market so then a question

1189
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,839
how do you assess our own capabilities

1190
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,280
their potential

1191
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,920
so that in the time

1192
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,800
when

1193
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,720
the

1194
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,680
famous monsters of rock as i would call

1195
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,559
them

1196
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,880
have gone away how

1197
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,800
well will we will we be able uh to

1198
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,359
uh to do the evaluation

1199
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,359
maybe uh we could go away from the

1200
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,319
traditional russian discount discounts

1201
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,599
that i don't know how it

1202
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,720
has arrived in addition to the emerging

1203
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
markets this country because political

1204
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,480
risks have always been taken to account

1205
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,359
we for instance can offer discounts for

1206
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,760
our companies having a positive cash

1207
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,200
flow and assign

1208
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,200
like a positive

1209
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,400
factor

1210
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
to it as opposed to

1211
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,319
the tech companies in the u.s we're not

1212
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,440
everybody

1213
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,760
the cash flow is positive i think some

1214
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,319
knew to become a law maker

1215
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,160
in

1216
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,119
this

1217
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,319
couture

1218
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,280
market

1219
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,720
now that we don't have any foreign

1220
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,720
players

1221
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,440
let me try to

1222
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,040
start answering i mentioned reuters and

1223
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,240
bloomberg it's not a problem it's a

1224
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,359
challenge you work with the provider

1225
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,400
he sends you a letter that he is

1226
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,000
disconnecting it's not pleasant it

1227
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,440
corrects your activities for several

1228
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,200
weeks

1229
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,559
for a month sometimes more but you will

1230
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,400
find we already found the providers who

1231
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,640
provide the same information not they

1232
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,960
are not western they are eastern

1233
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,359
it's not a problem it's a technical

1234
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,720
problem

1235
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,960
but we have more difficult problems

1236
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,839
that

1237
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,599
companies

1238
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,079
tend to disclose

1239
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,160
less information

1240
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,480
than how to form a consensus

1241
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,599
it's not well known but such factors

1242
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,800
will become

1243
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,520
weaker we are at the peak

1244
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,720
of information uh

1245
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,920
distortion so let us come to the end uh

1246
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,640
bring to the end our session

1247
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,040
so in your question

1248
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,480
you had

1249
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,400
an answer a traditional answer

1250
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,760
people

1251
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,400
say they need several months i know

1252
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,960
people who solved the problem in three

1253
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,920
days

1254
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,440
modern technologies social media three

1255
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,480
days

1256
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,680
more

1257
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,559
we have a lot of telegram channels which

1258
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,520
can

1259
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,920
provide any kind of information and

1260
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,559
finally i agree with the colleagues

1261
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,760
it's a great niche that is going to be

1262
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,240
filled very quickly

1263
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,119
lack of information well it's like lack

1264
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,960
of food

1265
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,920
and

1266
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,200
we

1267
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,240
worked

1268
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,960
in the 90s what is lack of information

1269
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
it's money

1270
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,440
well at this positive point i would like

1271
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,040
to conclude our section the fact that we

1272
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,520
are here discussing the

1273
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,640
future of the russian stock market and

1274
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,839
the

1275
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,640
companies that may work there it means

1276
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,040
that the market existed it does exist

1277
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,480
and it will exist

1278
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,359
positive is one of the examples that

1279
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,440
where everything is going to be all

1280
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,000
right thank you for coming thank you for

1281
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,720
