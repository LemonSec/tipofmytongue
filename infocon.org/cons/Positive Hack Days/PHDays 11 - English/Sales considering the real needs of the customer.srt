1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,880
and i can only say that our presentation

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,039
for the next 20 minutes will change the

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,680
life of those who stay

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
to the better

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840
and they will feel more secure

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
so i represent mond

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
distributor of software

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,440
for us

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,800
for the entire i.t market distribution

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
is important an important component who

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,320
understands where the market is moving

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
in the last few

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
years

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,199
we

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,559
raised our revenues only in the security

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,079
area alone

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
and in this

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,720
area if we look at our regional network

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
it's very large it includes not only

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
russia but cis

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,680
and mongolia and in 2022.

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,200
[Music]

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
not only deliver positive technology

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
solutions where experts will help our

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
partners to promote such systems and we

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,119
help our customers we

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,360
train our customers which is very

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
important what does the customer need to

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
buy a certain product

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,479
he

31
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
must understand the product

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,360
so we offer not only a demonstration we

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,119
understand training in installation

34
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,040
deployment and

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
maintaining there are two factors of

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,479
training you can train a person in

37
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
software product as such and the second

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,439
point that we miss

39
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,079
often when you come to

40
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600
a

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
financial director

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,399
start talking at a conference

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,800
nice technology it will protect us

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
against

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,720
what does the financial director say

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
expensive

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
he doesn't understand how expensive it

48
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,319
it's important for him to say expensive

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
for you to see whether you can buy it

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
cheaper and second we have no budget

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
no money

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
extreme

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
so the financial director understands

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
where he can spend the money and where

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
he cannot spend it for example if he

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,480
spends it on an additional shop he

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
understands how how more how much more

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
revenue he will get from that shop

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
so we do master classes for our

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
customers to protect

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,319
their ideas in the language of business

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
this is our competitive edge

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
demonstration resources are focused not

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
only on demonstrating the product but on

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
protecting that product with the

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,120
financial director if the financial

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
director gives you the money

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
then he comes to you and says i gave you

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,480
30 million when

70
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760
are you going to give it back

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
i said well i

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
spent the money on

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
positive technologies so we trained the

74
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
people to

75
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,599
work with software and prove the

76
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,959
efficiency of that product

77
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,280
marketing of course in 2003 for you to

78
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
buy a solution how many times would you

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,519
like to touch the customer 2003

80
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,879
three times

81
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,159
you call it

82
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,439
him

83
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,159
you show him a booklet

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
you bring something to touch he says

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
well yes why not bring us we're going to

86
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
buy in 2013

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
we need 15 approaches

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,798
and any call

89
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,799
of your salesperson generates losses

90
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,160
if the customer says i'm going to buy

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
so

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
now marketing is about automation

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
a person from 25 to 45

94
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,280
or

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
earning more than 300

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,639
300 000 no

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
the approach should be focused for

98
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,320
example you take a company x5 retail

99
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
group i need

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
security director

101
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
and all our marketing should touch him

102
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
if they don't touch him you don't work

103
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,280
your approach doesn't work we help our

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
customers to package our solution in

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
such a way so that they touch the people

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
who are really

107
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
a decision who are really decision

108
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
makers and our customers like it

109
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
let's now talk about

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
what are the most important things that

111
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
you need

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,039
to

113
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,400
bear in mind

114
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
in order to protect

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
your projects

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
it's clear the market is growing now

117
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
considering the shortage

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,479
of

119
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,600
personnel of employees and people who

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,039
can do something and

121
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,240
brains that can think of something

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
it's also important to note that

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,080
business wants to see more and more

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,039
analytics intelligence they understand

125
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,919
more and more that i.t is taking uh more

126
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
and more of their budget but then uh

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
they want to uh understand if it's

128
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,160
worthwhile uh how can you prove uh that

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
you're worth my money uh what happens if

130
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
i don't give you money

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,800
well frankly uh the relation a

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,280
relationship like this is not

133
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
something you would wish to be involved

134
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,199
in imagine you meet a beautiful woman

135
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,639
she's full enough to marry you and once

136
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
she understands that you're

137
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,440
not the guy she really wanted she starts

138
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
extorting things from you a pair of

139
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
shoes and you bag same things in

140
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,440
business if a person from uh security or

141
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
from iit comes to me only

142
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
to scare me

143
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
it means i'm not happy talking to them

144
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,720
i'll be pushing them back or down

145
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
using uh

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
the so-called business partners friends

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
who has business partners uh in your

148
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,360
companies i mean i.t business partner

149
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,160
well

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
don't be modest don't be shy so it's

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,840
better to raise your hand to understand

152
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,599
that you're communicating well friends

153
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,080
uh your game is over uh why is uh

154
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,039
business in involving business partners

155
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
to this uh conversation because they

156
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
don't want uh to talk in technology

157
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
terms they bring in business partners to

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
translate but if the project succeeds uh

159
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
who's done the great job business

160
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
partner and if it's a failure then uh

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
the person responsible

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
so more

163
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,120
it's not enough that this

164
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
stratum uh becomes a political uh

165
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
killer for us so but it's also a problem

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
with funding so if there's a need to

167
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
take up a business partner you better

168
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,599
involve them with your division so that

169
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,120
you should talk

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
with them so taking a look at any uh

171
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,440
company basically there are only two

172
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,599
vectors to choose from to focus first to

173
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
earn more money

174
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,000
just to expand the funnel

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
by attracting or capturing more

176
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
customers and the second

177
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,879
vector is to bring down the cost of

178
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,039
every operation bring out the cost of

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
every transaction and here it's very

180
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,639
important to understand that if you're

181
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,240
closer to the first part

182
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,879
that meaning you will find words so that

183
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
will persuade the chairman of the board

184
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
that you indeed bring the money then

185
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
your career path is going to go up if

186
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,120
you are going to

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,919
shrink correctly it will also be stable

188
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,840
you'll be the best person in the team

189
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,479
you'll have the best professionals

190
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
people spending 25 years of their life

191
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
in the job i mean both ways are good but

192
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
you have to clearly understand

193
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,319
what

194
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
this decision what this solution helps

195
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,759
us do

196
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
and now take let's take a look at the

197
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,280
classic

198
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,599
chain uh in any company uh as an example

199
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,599
uh we will first start with a commercial

200
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,120
company but then you can look at the

201
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
government government organization which

202
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,320
business

203
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,279
process

204
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,480
is number one in any company so hurry up

205
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
number one business process

206
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
sales number one so you come and you

207
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,360
start selling no this doesn't work the

208
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
first thing

209
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
manufacturing

210
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,440
well

211
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,959
you can actually manufacture everything

212
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
but nobody will need that so what is

213
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,200
that he's back in the ussr it's a

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
business plan so basically it's

215
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
marketing right analyzing the market

216
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
understanding uh how much the market can

217
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,000
take from you what it wants so you

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,279
planned second part

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
alexander tell us

220
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
second part

221
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
is procurement so you need to provide

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
for the operation the company of course

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
it includes people and services and

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
production

225
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
well the third part is production and

226
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
the fourth is sales sales is the fourth

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
so this way if you take a look at the

228
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,040
entire chain

229
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
there are always these four elements

230
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,760
if you are looking at where to find the

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
budget as how to prove the value of a

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
solution in the market

233
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
so you go

234
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,680
and first try to understand who is

235
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
the most important function you know for

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
the dive the first dialogue of these

237
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,519
forms let's look take a look at the

238
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,680
vertical financial verticals

239
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
now uh what's of interest for the owners

240
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,600
of the company in terms of financial

241
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
outcome what's of interest to them

242
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
profit no wrong wrong

243
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,560
the

244
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
is the owner can be interested in profit

245
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,240
but the owner is always considering the

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
effect the company based on

247
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
how much money they have in their pocket

248
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,519
and that's dividend

249
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
the owner does they work themselves well

250
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
in most cases don't the first

251
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,519
the first order uh what is to appoint

252
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
the ceo so the ceo how it is uh

253
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
friends what are they responsible for in

254
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
financial terms

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
yes it's there where they have profit

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
and loss there we have these financial

257
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
indicators so these guys do they work

258
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,959
themselves

259
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
well they can't not work

260
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
well actually they do work except that

261
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
we don't know what they're doing

262
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,399
of course these people work

263
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,880
uh top management uh develops the

264
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,760
business strategy but then these people

265
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
appoint a specific

266
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,720
mid

267
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
level management financial indicator

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
what are these people responsible for

269
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
what

270
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
are they interested in in terms of

271
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
financial indicators accounting is

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
accounting responsible for profits is it

273
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
you who are responsible the for-profits

274
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,519
as security officers no guys it's kpi

275
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,880
for the budget

276
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,839
look attention you have a certain

277
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
business indicator for the budget and

278
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
that's what's of interest to you so the

279
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,920
accounting

280
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,240
requires

281
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,920
bonuses because

282
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
they have

283
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,200
issued or

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
submitted all the reports in time

285
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
and

286
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,519
for

287
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,640
the workers

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
and people who do uh specific work is

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
the salary

290
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
so when you come to some experts if you

291
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,880
have a tender community for instance you

292
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
have to clearly if you understand

293
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
clearly what's of interest for these

294
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
people what financial indicator are you

295
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
going to push uh in order for them to

296
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
agree they said so what i was saying

297
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
positive technology is okay let's do it

298
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,720
you have to clearly understand what it

299
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,680
leads to

300
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,800
and then

301
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
a very important question arises and

302
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
what is business continuity all about

303
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,839
what's yourself why are silence

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,480
the time is running hey guys

305
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
the business continuity is

306
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,279
oh look

307
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,399
we are experts in security

308
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,880
so business continuity is the continuity

309
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,320
of pure cash flow into the pocket of the

310
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,440
owner of the business this is what

311
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
defines everything but then it spreads

312
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
to each

313
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
function and you have to clearly

314
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
understand that if you take a look at

315
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
business process in the company you can

316
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
always say that there's there are

317
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
business processes the stoppage of which

318
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,160
will lead to complete stop of business

319
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
and that's mission critical and there of

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
course they'll give us budgets to

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,760
protect these business processes there

322
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,560
are business processes that are called

323
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,839
business critical well these business

324
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,240
processes are the stoppage of which will

325
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
lead to a reduction

326
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
of revenues

327
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,079
and there are

328
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
everything there's everything else so

329
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
when you paint

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,079
your systems and monitoring in different

331
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,040
colors

332
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
you do it and not the way you like it

333
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,399
but

334
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,800
considering how easy it will be for the

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
ceo to understand it because defending a

336
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
report is very easy

337
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
over the past month the number of

338
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,600
attacks in our infrastructure

339
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
the

340
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,680
production control systems uh

341
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,480
was

342
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,079
1050.

343
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,320
all these attacks were rebuffed by the

344
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
excellent solution from positive

345
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,320
technologies had this not has these

346
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,279
attacks

347
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,199
been uh

348
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,000
successful you would have lost 16 hours

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
of

350
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,480
uh the work the

351
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
production which means 16 tons

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
times

353
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,160
the

354
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
the time

355
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,519
and you have to clear understand that

356
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
this report will be read not by yourself

357
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,839
about the management who has paid the

358
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
money to

359
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
find these solutions succeed

360
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,760
red are the mission critical thing

361
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
yellow business critical and green are

362
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,639
all the rest for green and yellow you

363
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,639
can claim the right budget if you

364
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
use the right language to talk to the

365
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
management and here if we arrive at the

366
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
following point hey guys

367
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
tell me please which schematic

368
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
is going to look more attractive more

369
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,199
persuasive the left one or the right one

370
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,560
well for who

371
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,839
i mean for a decision uh making a person

372
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,160
uh the one who makes a decision to fund

373
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
our cool solutions

374
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
so the solution where business can be

375
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,199
seen because once again a chairman of

376
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
the board tell me told me one important

377
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,399
thing alexander if uh i understand what

378
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,839
you have in the right picture you i

379
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
don't need you i'll fire you you are

380
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
here for me and not uh to try and

381
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,920
understand it and this is what i'm

382
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,519
responsible for and that's of interest

383
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,000
to me so therefore if you're defending a

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
project always look at this thing to be

385
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,760
understandable for business the pictures

386
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
should be

387
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
drawn

388
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
in the style that's understandable for

389
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,639
the business

390
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
and here or we need business partners

391
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,199
it's for this that we need them it's

392
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
them who are writing these schematics

393
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,079
it's them who are bringing uh the proof

394
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,360
of how great we are uh on to the top

395
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
and it's natural that the first thing to

396
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,560
do to protect the good projects

397
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,839
is not

398
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
to say give me money to do

399
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,959
this project you need to offer cases

400
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,480
let's say

401
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,040
the company next door a considerable a

402
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
serious disruption happened

403
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
so if they lost a hundred million

404
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
dollars for things why

405
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,320
because they didn't have a positive

406
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,880
technology sandbox solution and this is

407
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
the solution that

408
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,399
collects the information about viruses

409
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,440
about our company to run them in a

410
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
sandbox and then we'll be able to

411
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,880
defend ourselves from them much better

412
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,279
so a case is always perceived better by

413
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,160
a person he'll be always able to find

414
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
words that even your kid would

415
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
understand of course

416
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,399
the

417
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
maximum cost

418
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,199
is

419
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,560
concept is important i told you like

420
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,600
how does the business uh perceive the

421
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
cost of a solution that can cover the

422
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
problem

423
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
10

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
10 of the output so that's an ideal

425
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,480
situation well maybe you can drag it to

426
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,600
15.

427
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,399
so if you understand the cost of risk

428
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
you can clearly

429
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
define for business that we are

430
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
protecting this part

431
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
this is the cost

432
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,519
we are

433
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,559
keeping that cost that will allow us to

434
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,400
continue business for the business to

435
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
continue and of course uh when talking

436
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,679
to business we are using the language

437
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,839
that is typical of a decision making

438
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
person you need to have clear arguments

439
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,280
and proof and once you've got the money

440
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
uh start bringing reports to the

441
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,079
management

442
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,240
at the end of the first month uh see how

443
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,520
good we are

444
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
you know how many attacks happened and

445
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
we hadn't even know about them happening

446
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,320
and we managed to

447
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
stop them

448
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
that's an important point a supporting

449
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
moment the manager starts talking to you

450
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
starts seeing you uh starts consulting

451
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,320
you and you're becoming a very uh

452
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,600
important point and here is a point that

453
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
we always uh

454
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,120
mention in our trainings every person uh

455
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,160
has a way a different way a virtue

456
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,520
some people need to see a picture others

457
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,559
there's this whole brain

458
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,840
model which shows that people

459
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,360
think differently

460
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
people some people see the

461
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,960
yellow

462
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
quadrants it's people who are most

463
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
interested in trends

464
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
the trends like for instance in the

465
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,760
development of their own business and

466
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
positive technologies is an innovative

467
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
product and they will be looking at your

468
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
presentations from the viewpoint of

469
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
whether the solution is cool or not

470
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,080
the blue ones the blue segment

471
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
uh the letter a

472
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,559
these are the so called strategies

473
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,679
these people

474
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,840
uh are they usually

475
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
like

476
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
cfo

477
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,480
a commercial director for them uh you

478
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,600
need to use graphs diagrams and pictures

479
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,880
to prove

480
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,960
so compare this solution with that

481
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
solution

482
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
the flowchart looks like this is the

483
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
language that they perceive if

484
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
you need to come to an engineering

485
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,640
department that resists your solution uh

486
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
strongly or if you need to talk to an

487
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,280
accountant

488
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,160
who has a considerable weight in the on

489
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
the board then you need to

490
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
do

491
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
incremental paces it's been implemented

492
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
this way and that way the implementation

493
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,120
takes five days now you need two people

494
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
so people even in a presentation have go

495
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,799
through the whole process of

496
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,320
implementation and this becomes uh a

497
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,320
basis uh from the foundation now

498
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,000
to prove them that your solution makes

499
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
sense there are other people hr people

500
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
sales people they need a

501
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,880
cool picture

502
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
when you go to conferences you often

503
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
see presentations like success stories a

504
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
guy from certain bank

505
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
comes up on stage and starts telling how

506
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
it works it's a certain psychology but

507
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
it's a psychology uh that it's a better

508
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
uh vis-a-vis

509
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
market marketing people and sales people

510
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,960
why don't we always get impressed by

511
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,280
this because we think at the language of

512
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
the blue and the green

513
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
pictures here

514
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
colors here but

515
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
please understand that there are people

516
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
of other type work in the bank

517
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
i couldn't uh defend a solution

518
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,480
until i decided that my leader is yellow

519
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,799
and i came to him and said sergey the

520
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,840
project

521
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,159
is just cool stuff it number one the

522
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,799
market it'll be cool he said you promise

523
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
i said promise

524
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
go do it he said and that was the

525
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,080
briefest meeting

526
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
in half a year because i started to use

527
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,120
his own language even though myself as a

528
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
head of i.t

529
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,760
was much greener

530
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
so in conclusion my presentation i'd

531
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,760
like to say

532
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,880
that we as a distributor

533
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,960
have prepared the games

534
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,080
all these business games to bring them

535
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
through the team if your partners we

536
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,919
invite partners

537
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,640
on

538
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
to the second part

539
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
we'll be considering

540
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,520
about the same aspect as now in phd but

541
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
as applied to a specific customer

542
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
will do attacks and defense in different

543
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
industries and will help their partner

544
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
to

545
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
explain it to the customer

546
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,159
for us it's always a game situation

547
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,080
three four five times you run the

548
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,000
catalog through your head and then it

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,280
becomes easier for you to go to the

550
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
customer if it's a masterclass for

551
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
customers

552
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
we help people to defend the budgets to

553
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
correctly scale and size uh to

554
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,679
match it to the business processes that

555
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,679
are operating your company and play this

556
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
way so this is how the process uh looks

557
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
it takes a whole day we run a business

558
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,600
game

559
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,120
where we focus on different aspects of

560
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,240
solution

561
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
defense

562
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
including legislation

563
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880

564
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320

565
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,039
