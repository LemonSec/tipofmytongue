1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
one of the key topics of phd

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,720
conference is

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
information independence

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
and let's talk about

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,680
this with maria zacharova

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,600
from the ministry of foreign affairs of

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,039
the russian federation thank you very

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,000
much

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,119
maria for joining us at pht

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,840
at the conference well it's weird to

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
come to the studio to

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
people who are in the business of the

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
digital we've changed all formats in the

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,320
past two years including tv formats in

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,160
the past the tv picture he used a skype

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
uh skype communication rarely but

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
now you can't imagine the world without

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
it really

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,039
even the top government officials are

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,600
talking to each other via internet and

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,559
the uh various apps so these fields of

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
retro to me

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
skype is convenient but it's so less

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
to my liking you see the person remotely

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
and you can't really impart all of the

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
importance emotions and everything what

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
happens happening here is a battle do

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,119
you think that

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,159
uh

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
this should be

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,320
uh there should be soul in that kind of

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
discussions but the soul should be

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
present in communication between people

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,479
but uh what you are talking about today

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
uh do you think uh discussion should be

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
focusing only on the effects

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
why is it based on emotions well i think

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
that it's best to view the battle here

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
on the site

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,520
well then not everything is lost if

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
people who are in the digital business

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,560
believe that seoul still means a lot

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
it's wonderful because it's something

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
that i think is amazing these days i'm

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
looking at global trends i'm not talking

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
about our country only but i'm looking

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
at global trends and i see

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,520
this division

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,240
of the digital flows the new digital

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
capabilities new communication

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,799
capabilities and

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,000
the

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
fight to

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
maintain the traditional forms of

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,480
everything of uh communicating

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
uh doing uh

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
of uh

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,680
you know

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
doing business as well

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
uh i we

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,319
we

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
it's it's

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,080
not good to exist between the two

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,319
extremes it would be wonderful if we

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,519
could get the best out of the two worlds

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,959
uh for the

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
digital not to dominate for us not to be

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
on the road towards

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
or well uh all the dystopian uh

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
scenarios but on the other hand would

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,599
like to

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,720
be able to save save on things that can

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
be saved on and not at the expense of

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
the really important uh things i'm all

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,239
in favor of hybrid but i don't like the

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,159
word hybrid i want in favor of

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
harmonization

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
i can't agree with you kavit kavit

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,200
has been with us uh for a long time

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
but at the same time

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
when people are away from you and still

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
you can communicate

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
and it gives the satisfaction of

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
achieving the results but the

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,640
satisfaction is momentarily but tomorrow

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,120
the day after tomorrow whether you are

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,879
to together whether together you

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
uh stay on the same

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
on the same level sort of stage to

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,319
continue your calculation today and

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,239
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
convict created fantastic opportunities

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
for communication and to save time and

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,159
on the one hand it's wonderful because

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,840
people who are separated

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,640
by our borders by distances who cannot

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,879
come together they still could talk to

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
each other this created great

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
opportunities for the mass media and for

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
their reporters who could not travel but

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
still they could interview their guests

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
and everything but

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
this is a double-edged sword and many

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
people tend to forget about it and

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
sometimes they don't even think about it

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,760
they

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
do not remember about it this led to the

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,560
increase in the amount of information

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,440
yes exactly and the information market

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
called the information village then the

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
information newsroom

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
market became so global and the speed of

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
information emergence

114
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,719
reached

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
cosmic speeds but humans stayed the same

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
we are developing the skills but we

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
can't perceive

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
well exactly the people cannot perceive

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,400
they cannot absorb that much information

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
they cannot process that much

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,560
information and they think that was

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
achieved was

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
opposites

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,840
too much information

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
leaves

126
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
people without solid ground

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
people cannot perform fact checking uh

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
using their own resources even if the

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,479
information was already checked

it's difficult to come up with your

131

opinion because there's too much

point of view there is the

134

opinion leaders point of view there is

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
the politicians point of view here are

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,000
have the expertise and they become the

quite curious it feels like a circle is

drawn around you and it's difficult to

get out of it all your movements

i made about five years ago and it came

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
true you can look up interviews i was

176
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,120
speaking at different digital platforms

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
i participated in discussions and i was

178
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,599
saying that today we leave that was five

179
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,479
or six years ago we live in the time

180
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,479
when there are no borders in the digital

181
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,360
environment and i was saying look for us

182
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
to move in space

183
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,039
the physical space the real life

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,000
we need

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
visas we need passports we need ids we

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
need

187
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,280
documents we need travel documents

188
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
tickets and transportation etc etc

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,599
the digital

190
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,039
environment enables us to move in space

191
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,319
and in time in the information flows in

192
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
different spheres without any limits

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
and more than that

194
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
in the last 10 years there was this

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,800
trend when digital technologies appeared

196
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
that enabled translation using online

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,240
translation and functions or online

198
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,639
translation was embedded into a

199
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,319
particular platform and that was the

200
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
last barrier that

201
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
would not

202
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
let us uh

203
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,440
become one become united so all barriers

204
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
were removed even the most difficult

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
languages in recent years were

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,360
incorporated into the social media et

207
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,919
cetera well speaking about telegram they

208
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
got stuck they need to

209
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
introduce translation to telegram as

210
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,320
soon as possible now was

211
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
talking about this

212
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
to their representatives on many

213
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
occasions is something very necessary

214
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
these days

215
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
so i was saying that we enjoy the

216
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
uniqueness of the moment and i made a

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
forecast that is coming true today

218
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
unfortunately

219
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
uh alas i was saying

220
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
it's not going to last because this real

221
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
freedom true freedom

222
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
is not uh affordable uh the if

223
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
it would not be

224
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
let's uh

225
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,519
heaven by

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,760
uh the human kind and that's what we are

227
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,519
observing today is that the internet is

228
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
being segmented and this is not being

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
done by individual states they want to

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,040
maintain their political economic or

231
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,720
financial agenda but we see it on the

232
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
part of those who created the internet

233
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,240
space as common first and this is

234
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
amazing really it's surprising first

235
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,959
they created this common shared space it

236
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,760
was

237
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,560
uh everywhere it was ubiquitous like in

238
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
the united states you know

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
they are the uh

240
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,560
forefathers of the very idea of the

241
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
internet global coverage the digital

242
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,279
giants um and everything and

243
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,839
they themselves became they themselves

244
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
became those who

245
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,120
started the reverse policy

246
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
the segment of the internet

247
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,000
control over digital platforms

248
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,120
the ability to press the red button

249
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
of activating this activating and

250
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
moderation as well the red button the

251
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,839
red button of the uh disabling whole

252
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,079
countries and technologies exactly that

253
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,760
was early uh 2000 end of 1990s early

254
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,959
2000s

255
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,000
remember

256
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
when the

257
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,839
internet

258
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
was made

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
bigger via

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
the

261
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,839
accession of

262
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,519
china uh 1.5 billion people and

263
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
immediately they built they create a

264
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,399
chinese firewall in the internet so

265
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,600
that's

266
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
from the

267
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
western world's uh perspective to

268
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
introduce complete control over the

269
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,760
internet but from the perspective of

270
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,959
china they did it in order to build the

271
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
system of control and regulation and

272
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
language and technologies exactly and

273
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
then

274
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
using and creating the sovereignty to

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
connect to the global network and look

276
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
now how

277
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,240
they traded places today china is open

278
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
you can come with your products yes

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,680
there are some restrictions there are

280
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
nuances but on the other hand they

281
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
aren't trying to oust anyone from their

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
market but it is the countries and the

283
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
corporations that originally were

284
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
talking about the need for a global

285
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
approach who are pursuing that policy of

286
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,040
exclusion

287
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
to go back to your other question

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
independent sovereignty why what for

289
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
do we need it

290
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
of course it is necessary

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
i um separate these things i believe

292
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
that the process that today the united

293
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,920
states leave to segment and to censure

294
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
the internet

295
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
is

296
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,399
not part of independence and sovereignty

297
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,880
they are two different processes as

298
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
countries as peoples as communities we

299
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,440
must have a digital sovereignty

300
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,399
but

301
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,959
no country

302
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
shall be able to sense you moderates

303
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
others space based on its own

304
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
perspective

305
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,399
so what is digital sovereignty and

306
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
digital independence i will talk about

307
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,880
it not as a person from the digital

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
world or someone representing the

309
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
digital business but as a person

310
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,360
who

311
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
works and acts in the field of

312
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
international information

313
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
well there are many different aspects to

314
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,079
the notion but um let's just identify a

315
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,360
few

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
platforms

317
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,200
your own technologies basis platforms

318
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,680
that would be supported

319
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,839
with domestic software and

320
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,160
hardware and technologies your own

321
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
technologies

322
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
that or technologies that are not 100

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,760
percent dependent on other countries or

324
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
corporations and the second aspect

325
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
that comes to mind is legislation

326
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
legislation that regulates flexibly

327
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
rigidly softly

328
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,600
well depending on the circumstances that

329
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
regulates

330
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,200
the situation and the online mode

331
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
protecting

332
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,279
its own digital environment where

333
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,600
necessary protecting it from the

334
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
aggression from the outside

335
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
and enabling connections with

336
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
other environments wherever

337
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,279
it's beneficial

338
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
you you talked about platforms

339
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
value-added platforms and you also

340
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,519
mentioned uh

341
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
legislation of regulation oh well of

342
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
course of course

343
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
they are well as our partners

344
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
english-speaking partners call it it's

345
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,600
the in between

346
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
digital security

347
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
cyber security

348
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
they are regulated technologies and

349
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,360
can't be otherwise because

350
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
they are prone with crime they can be

351
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
abused for criminal purposes and crime

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,440
leads to punishment uh regulation and

353
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
shows uh that crime is punished and

354
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,560
technology is can be used as a tool of

355
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,959
crime so our country is the one that

356
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,440
the end of 1990s early 2000s operated

357
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
the very topic of international

358
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
information security into the agenda of

359
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,079
the united nations i'm talking about the

360
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,079
general assembly resolutions of various

361
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,040
task forces and expert working groups

362
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,440
and we pursued this uh work along many

363
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
many different vectors when it was not

364
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,800
here the global trend and of course it

365
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
was not yet

366
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,680
uh a uh

367
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
prior euresi the greatest priority of

368
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,720
the

369
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,120
uno but understanding the trend

370
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,120
knowing that

371
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,240
that

372
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
knowing understanding the trend

373
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,399
understanding what's happening

374
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,040
and

375
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
that there should be

376
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
there should be some

377
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,519
uh global uh control and regulation so

378
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
that this field is not managed by

379
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
individual corporations or governments

380
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,959
in cooperation with corporations but to

381
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
make it all transparent and legitimate

382
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
so that there is some international

383
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
legal basis for it

384
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
to go back to information security and

385
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,959
its role in the modern

386
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,279
world digital world it feels like there

387
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,560
are three layers there is the hardware

388
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,079
a computer reserver then there is the

389
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,519
operating system

390
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
and the programs that run on it and

391
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
there is cyber security which controls

392
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
the hardware and the software around the

393
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
hardware and if

394
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,040
there is another link but if they are

395
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,480
creating system where the hardware

396
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
belongs to the same vendor then

397
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,040
or it comes from the same part of the

398
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,639
world you will you can't control it very

399
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,959
well but you forgot another component a

400
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
very important component

401
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,240
a person a human who operates the

402
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,839
hardware and the software

403
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
and without this most important link

404
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,199
everything else is secondary is the

405
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,320
human who should analyze and calculate

406
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,199
and see the risks and

407
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
and counter the risks and to

408
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,199
create the agenda that would

409
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,920
ensure potential threats invasion

410
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,880
humans

411
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
uh humans

412
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,759
not just uh individual experts but there

413
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
should be a government system uh in

414
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,519
charge of it not just one institutional

415
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
department but and network of

416
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,679
departments that are governing

417
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,280
the digital environment information

418
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
security at a professional level they

419
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,359
must copyright and they must take

420
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,959
decisions jointly it is a big

421
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,280
a big infrastructure

422
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,079
i'm

423
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
looking at the international experience

424
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
and the reality of today this is key in

425
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,079
the sense i mean her meaning was sensed

426
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,280
is

427
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
derived

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
or shaped by humans artificial

429
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,559
intelligence fortunately is not yet

430
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,000
that advanced uh so meanings are

431
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
shaped they are defined by humans by

432
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
professionals and then everything else

433
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,840
that you mentioned is secondary

434
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,400
in the digital agenda one of the biggest

435
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
meanings is that

436
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,200
uh things that

437
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
are

438
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
unacceptable for humans or businesses or

439
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
industries or

440
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,039
governments would not happen would not

441
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,919
happen as a result of a hack or a

442
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
hacker's attack

443
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,880
inadmissible it should be impossible but

444
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,799
this is a utopia it can't be

445
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
you know like in russian fairy tales

446
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
there's the sword that

447
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
kills anyone like you own the sword and

448
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
you can kill anyone any enemy and the

449
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,200
shield protects everyone and everything

450
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,560
so these two things are um

451
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,599
[Music]

452
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
opposing things we must stop the

453
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,679
development of the technology if we do

454
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,799
not want to get these threats if

455
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,120
someone who is outside

456
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,440
outside of this digital environment

457
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
would listen to this dialogue probably

458
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
uh that person would not even understand

459
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
us even though we speak russian but in

460
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,880
theory and practice we we understand

461
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
what we talk about and

462
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
uh it's a big philosophical question

463
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,679
whether we need to provide total freedom

464
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,880
to the technology development if it can

465
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
lead humankind

466
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
into a dead end but here even at this

467
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
wonderful forum will not be able to

468
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
answer this question

469
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,200
the moral and the legal framework must

470
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,120
be set from the start definitely but you

471
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,880
cannot always prevent the

472
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,200
events from from happening you can't

473
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,240
always

474
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
prevent new challenges from emergence

475
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,720
you need to calculate the risks you need

476
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,799
to try to avert them well you understand

477
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,760
that

478
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,240
humans are very inquisitive

479
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280
and

480
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
they're curious

481
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
they will want to find out but i agree

482
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
that prevention

483
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,480
must be built into the framework

484
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,240
technological progress if we start

485
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,039
stopping cyber security i mean if we try

486
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,720
to stop cyber security if we try to

487
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,799
control everything it will stop

488
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,799
uh technological progress but today

489
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,640
cyber security lags behind the progress

490
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
human thought

491
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
is in the driving seat while security is

492
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,400
in the passenger seat and we see that

493
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
over here we've got this cyber battle

494
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,440
where we simulate various scenarios

495
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
don't you think that

496
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,799
humans matter

497
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,600
humans must calculate the risks

498
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,799
humans

499
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,120
historic people

500
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,679
active participants of the process

501
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,679
humans must decide

502
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,799
whether

503
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,280
their speed

504
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,320
is balanced out with risks

505
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
humans must understand the consequences

506
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
we must not

507
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,000
leave people without

508
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,559
a choice if people want to take risks

509
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,440
it's their choice but i still believe in

510
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,520
the power of education people need to be

511
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,240
educated about their risks and they

512
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,120
should be able to take decisions

513
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
maybe they will sacrifice speeds but

514
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,120
they will

515
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,640
keep the basis that is truly valuable

516
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
this choice

517
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,720
it must be

518
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,039
it must be the result of education you

519
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,280
should not reveal prohibit you should

520
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,080
not stop you should not bend but through

521
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,720
education through information

522
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
you should demonstrate to every user or

523
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,039
to every corporation that probably you

524
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,120
do not need you have

525
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,280
fewer buttons on the phone or

526
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,000
probably

527
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,960
this

528
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,919
particular action can take five seconds

529
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,720
instead of 1.5 seconds probably you

530
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
don't need to speed up things maybe you

531
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
can stay within the

532
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,400
safe or current

533
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,880
current frameworks

534
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
progress

535
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,960
the word progress today is uh creating

536
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,320
meanings although progress is just a

537
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,919
movement it doesn't necessarily mean

538
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,000
that it's movement towards towards the

539
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
better world it depends on your

540
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,799
destination that you want to reach but

541
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,840
we start to take technological progress

542
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,799
to

543
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,679
mean a 100 positive goal because it's

544
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,840
more convenient it's comfortable it's a

545
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,600
matter of comfort

546
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
yes and it's a huge discussion

547
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,200
whether comfort should prevail over

548
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,280
everything else not just security but

549
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,720
everything else like the soul

550
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
preserving the soul observing the

551
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
personality it's a big question mark i'm

552
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
all in favor of harmonization in some

553
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,960
things

554
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,880
it is

555
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,240
essential

556
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,280
i like

557
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,760
organizing or like medical or like

558
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,240
surgeries remote

559
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,400
doctors consultations and sometimes it's

560
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,640
a whim a whim that leads to more

561
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,559
problems it's something that we've been

562
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,200
discussing until now the increase in the

563
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,440
speed of information dissemination kills

564
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
the quality of information you

565
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
understand

566
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
yes i do

567
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
and in russia we have a lot of grainy

568
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
guys guys and girls yes guys and girls

569
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,000
exactly

570
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
and yesterday here

571
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,799
with other guests

572
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,280
we were saying that russian

573
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
guys and girls are winning

574
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,400
uh various competitions uh for coders

575
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
around the world it means that we have a

576
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
very strong

577
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
engineering potential

578
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
inside the country

579
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,279
but also

580
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,799
to bring this potential to other

581
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,120
countries do you think that

582
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
we have opportunities for capital well

583
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,640
we need the opportunities inside the

584
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,080
countries there are so many different

585
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
priorities today that must be addressed

586
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
through technological engineering

587
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,520
solutions well inside the country we

588
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,640
don't have

589
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
we don't have

590
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,440
our own platform video hosting platforms

591
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,720
and it's a huge segment of information

592
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,840
security i don't know and information

593
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,080
security uh it touches upon all aspects

594
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,770
of life economy

595
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,039
[Music]

596
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,120
services uh banking education we do not

597
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
have a normal

598
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,479
a visual hosting platform

599
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,000
i'm listening to these discussions but

600
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,120
uh

601
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,200
we've been hearing the same

602
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,679
ideas repeated over and over for many

603
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,360
years the ministry of foreign affairs

604
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
and also

605
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,720
on a private level as users uh who

606
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,279
compare the means and the goals and who

607
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,200
have an ability to compare foreign

608
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
products with the russian analogs for

609
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
many years we've been asking we've been

610
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,919
pleading for

611
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,480
a normal video hosting with good

612
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
information protection and also good

613
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
ideology as well that would be mutually

614
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,600
beneficial for the platform for the user

615
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,840
do you think we'll have it one day

616
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,559
we've been talking about it for years

617
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,880
and uh there are all uh all the

618
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
opportunities you see and there is the

619
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,520
demand there is also the urgency of the

620
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
day we see the

621
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
blockings the shutoffs

622
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,039
that are no longer targeted not only

623
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,200
russian media and russian

624
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,159
politicians that have been

625
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,360
cut off

626
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
but even

627
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
individuals private individuals who are

628
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
who are being

629
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
shut down

630
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,559
and we

631
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,120
they could could have never become a

632
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
part of the global information world the

633
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
same level as the representatives of

634
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
other western countries

635
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,360
were because moderation was different uh

636
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,600
because the moderation engine worked

637
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
differently towards representatives of

638
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,760
different countries and also yes it's

639
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,240
based on technology but still the rules

640
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
were said by humans driven by a

641
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,159
particular ideology this is what we need

642
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,840
and that's what we don't need we need to

643
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
create it you see i don't know how many

644
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,840
more times it must be

645
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,760
repeated and the important thing is

646
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
we need to stop and it's a matter

647
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
that is ideologically politically

648
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
cultural culturally very important we

649
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,919
need to

650
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,279
stop

651
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,760
uh protecting

652
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,039
the

653
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
western platforms and websites and

654
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
hosting platforms and it exists and uh

655
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,919
it exists at a very high political level

656
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
i see it i read about it

657
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,440
i don't think it's relevant at this

658
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,200
point

659
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
the western monopolies act outside of

660
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,400
the rules

661
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
western monopolies

662
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,279
discriminate us

663
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,640
they act aggressively towards our

664
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
country and towards our people so first

665
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,400
we must create our base and then if

666
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,360
someone wants to whatever reason wants

667
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,039
to advocate for

668
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,080
western

669
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,960
platforms and digital platforms to

670
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
protect them to lobby for them

671
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,679
well it will be their personal business

672
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,679
but today we must stop it and we must

673
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,679
and i have already mentioned lobbying

674
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,840
and

675
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,080
protectionism we must stop roofing as we

676
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
said in russia the western platforms

677
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,799
digital platforms in our country

678
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,158
in cyber security

679
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,120
[Music]

680
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,960
substituted with domestic products at an

681
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,880
accelerated rate you know about the

682
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
presidential degree uh that speaks about

683
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
2025 we talked to

684
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,279
developers

685
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,679
today at the conference and i see in

686
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,720
their eyes

687
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,039
a confidence that will happen it must

688
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,840
happen it must happen it must happen

689
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
yes i'm saying i'm telling you that i

690
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
don't see any doubt in their eyes they

691
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
are confident that it's going to happen

692
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,320
it's just that the process of deploying

693
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,240
new solutions it takes a time a year

694
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,120
where

695
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,320
two years

696
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,760
accelerates intensify these are the

697
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,480
rights for words it must be done at full

698
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,000
speed and at full capacity

699
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
there is political will there is

700
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
decisiveness there is

701
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
a wish there are laws already the

702
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,480
important thing that

703
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,240
uh lobbying

704
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,760
doesn't act as a decelerator

705
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
for western

706
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,240
to a technologies

707
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,039
extent well actually it's something that

708
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,440
was killing domestic competition when

709
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,240
domestic developer when the domestic

710
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,799
manufacturer all those brainy

711
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,360
guys and gals like you were saying they

712
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
could not

713
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,600
could not

714
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,039
make it for

715
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,559
competition they were competing against

716
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,480
a very wealthy

717
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
a monster

718
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,600
that

719
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,720
were protected on all sides in including

720
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,760
by political political

721
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,080
uh lobbying yes and the competition was

722
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,840
not on technical terms very often they

723
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
were in terms of advertising budgets

724
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
exactly exactly

725
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
we we already have a lot of good

726
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,120
solutions so maybe some are built with

727
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,360
components from asia but still

728
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
many of the

729
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
software

730
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,080
well in the software especially they

731
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
can't even advertise various look at the

732
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,080
magazines the magazines that are

733
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,960
even if it's a franchisee but they are

734
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
registered as a russian a mass media but

735
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,039
they can't even get

736
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,200
an advertisement published in those

737
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
magazines you know how much paragraph

738
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
advertising information costs in those

739
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,039
publications

740
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,000
but and they are not uh expert

741
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,720
journals they are mass market magazines

742
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
it means that the these magazine

743
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,600
publications are not

744
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
they don't have a narrow specialization

745
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,520
uh i mean a wide audience to buy to

746
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,480
uh install for the corporations you need

747
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,679
to to get advertised not to be present

748
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,880
at conferences or at the

749
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,080
fairs only but it should be

750
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,159
marketed you need to be advertised

751
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,159
directly indirectly but it means money

752
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,080
huge money and the money is big not only

753
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
because there are

754
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,600
associated costs no

755
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,159
uh you set uh the uh price

756
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,000
because you are a a certain price

757
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,840
because you are a monopoly and you are a

758
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,679
foreign monopoly and you set such a high

759
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,919
price that no company especially young

760
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,600
developing company cannot afford

761
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,559
startups as well

762
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,840
we were

763
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
told by our so-called international

764
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,640
partners they introduced this

765
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
terminology startup support

766
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,000
but

767
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,240
what it boiled down to it boiled down to

768
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
the killing of small companies

769
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,080
by

770
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,799
by by these companies being bought

771
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,279
mergers well they were bought

772
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,960
they were bought in order to stop the

773
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
development of the technology that could

774
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,799
potentially compete with the technology

775
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,399
that these big corporations already

776
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,120
owned so i mean these areas

777
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
they are not related to the

778
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
operations of the ministry of foreign

779
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,159
affairs we have other relevant

780
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,320
ministries and departments for this but

781
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,279
as i am someone who works

782
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,399
at the

783
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,240
crossroads of the international

784
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,799
regulations and

785
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,440
information and this crossroads can be

786
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,320
called digital diplomacy one of the

787
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,159
first probably you know that we were one

788
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
of the first to create a

789
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,880
a very diverse presence in the social

790
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
media and everywhere one of the first to

791
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
support

792
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,159
domestic

793
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,039
manufacturers in the cyberspace yes the

794
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
industry feels a lot of support

795
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,519
from the state in i.t and subsequently

796
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,679
yes but we started doing this back in

797
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,320
2011 2012 at a very high level the

798
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,640
minister foreign affairs sergey lavrov

799
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
personally took part in the opening of

800
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,399
our accounts in kentucky and

801
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,640
uh at other platforms we used every

802
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,360
opportunity of our ministry of the

803
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,320
headquarters and all the foreign um

804
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,760
representative offices uh to promote the

805
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
development of our platforms everywhere

806
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
well i mentioned only one performance in

807
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
fact there are many platforms like that

808
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,840
and the platforms know about it about

809
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,320
our presence we communicate with them uh

810
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,159
closely thank you very much for this

811
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,799
interview yes well actually we received

812
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,600
a prize of roonette

813
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,360
when was it that was 2013 or 2014. we

814
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,200
received the prize

815
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,240
for

816
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,919
the

817
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,080
network of our presence

818
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
online online presence it was a

819
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,159
breakthrough moment for us

820
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,880
so i'm speaking to you with pain in my

821
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,799
heart and with the hope for a better

822
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,918
future thank you
