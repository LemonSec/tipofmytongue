1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,319
dear friends just couple of minutes ago

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,440
are attackers

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
they were able to

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
execute inaccessible event and organize

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
certain problems with purchasing of

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
tickets

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,720
in our transportation company that was

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,480
deployed in our replica well very often

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
main reason for such events in real life

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
are real vulnerabilities which exist in

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,079
the infrastructure of the company

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,360
and

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,920
how can we discover them properly how

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
can we properly inform about them and

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
how can we properly close them we're

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
going to speak about it and i'm going to

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
speak with la vadim soul of your hello

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,360
body but him is the head oh

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
threat analysis and information security

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
team in positive technologies

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,039
you

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
have my dear viewers you have a unique

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,520
opportunity

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,119
to hear the most interesting

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
things from vadim's presentation which

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
you will hear in positive technologies

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,960
this and when your presentation will

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
happen my presentation will happen

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
tomorrow okay we're ahead of time

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
today we're going to

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
look at results of what's going to be

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
spoken about tomorrow i think this is

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,439
wonderful hello buddhim hello julian can

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
you tell me please

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,640
why

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,640
are you working with vulnerabilities why

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
well i think that this is this was my

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,840
evolutionary process i just had to do it

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,680
plus all the trends are moving in the

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
direction that

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
management

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,399
yeah

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
the vulnerability management

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
and proper timely processing of them i

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
think this is what the future lies

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
if vendors are not going to remove

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
vulnerabilities and researchers and are

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
not going to inform them properly

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,560
in full volume and responsibly which is

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,079
very important

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,478
then the world can be

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
encoded by the encoders you know so we

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
have to work with it okay but jim i

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
think that positive technologies is

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,040
involved in discovery vulnerabilities in

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,239
the course of

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,200
20 yes as long as positive technologies

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
lives that's how long it does it so in

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
the course of this long period of time

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,599
children has grown up went to

61
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
universities and got married

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
and worked with vulnerabilities also

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,599
have changed

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,640
so how in the cause of this period the

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,080
process of search recording closure what

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
has changed in the life of the

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
researcher well i understand your

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
question

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
i think we have to first of all speak

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
about the break-even point which

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
happened last year when we've been

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
sanctioned and at this moment of time we

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
did feel that reporting process

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,640
has changed especially in the

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,319
side of the benders who are being

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
reported too we have american and

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
non-american vendors because american

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
vendors they

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
uh communities didn't have any right to

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,760
communicate with us because they have

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,800
their own regulators they have their own

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
orders and we've been searching for ways

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,599
around how can we inform them about

84
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,720
their vulnerabilities maybe not openly

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
maybe not to official channels so that

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,159
they in any case would be able to fix

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,080
this vulnerability and would be able to

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
provide and deliver

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
update patches to their end users and if

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
the users will be uh secure this is the

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,239
main reason why the informational

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,560
security leaves for so that people could

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
use informational security

94
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,400
software

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
hardware and

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,519
different

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,840
and not be subject to any risks so that

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,159
somebody would exploit a vulnerability

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,879
about which they have not been informed

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,879
well tell me please when you communicate

101
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
with vendors i've heard on many

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
occasions about different stories

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,640
stories that one vendor is working

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,200
properly another one is stumbling very

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
often another one does some crazy things

106
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,600
so let's look at your work with vendors

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,399
as a as a separate process can you tell

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,800
us about some interesting

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,080
pictures which might happen with vendors

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,720
and which we can get rid of and

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
simply by our life

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
well the biggest feature is when the

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
vendor is not reacting to researchers at

114
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
all does it happen yes it happens very

115
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,360
often

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
it's an often situation when vendor

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,520
has never faced any vulnerabilities

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
maybe if it's a niche product and they

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
never had to work with researchers so

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
they receive a letter

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
in their main

122
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
when some unknown person tells them okay

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
dear vendor we have discovered

124
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
vulnerability let's communicate about it

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
the vendor is getting lost they don't

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
know what how should they reply

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,400
so they are hiding and do nothing about

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
it

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
what should we do we should search for

130
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,120
options not only through the email maybe

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
some personal connections to this vendor

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
when you will be able to explain in a

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,000
human language that we fight for the

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
good it's not a blackmail it's nothing

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,479
but we just want to help you we just

136
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
want to make your product safer and to

137
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,919
protect your users this is an obvious

138
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,720
one

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,840
the second situation that we face is

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
we start communicating with the vendor

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
you deliver information about

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
vulnerability they look at it

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
everything's okay

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
but they never patch their product so

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,080
this process of vendor notification the

146
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,400
main objective is for vendor to produce

147
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,960
the patch and to keep the users on the

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
secure side so on a cognitive

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,639
subconscious level there's a certain

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,240
video

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
goal

152
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
to

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
have certain achievements as a

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
researcher i have discovered the

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
vulnerability but the main goal is to

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
defend end users to the update or patch

157
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,319
manufactured by the

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
vendor but if the vendor is not making

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,880
this patch it means that this process is

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,759
halted and broken

161
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
but why vendors do not make those

162
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
patches well it does happen and there

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
are different reasons for non-patching

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
why vendors are not baking patches and

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
i'm going to speak about it tomorrow

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
okay good any other stories from the

167
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,960
lives of uh

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
different vendors

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,039
it might have been a totally shocking

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,280
research

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
and

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
they approach responsible

173
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
discovery and they do everything

174
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
properly and sometimes it's an auntie

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
story but in a positive key when vendor

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
does everything properly and you think

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
that okay these guys fine finally

178
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,440
they're ripe and then you go and tell

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,039
everybody in the course of the week

180
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
they've reported you reported this

181
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
product to this vendor and they've done

182
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,199
more than you expected you shouldn't

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
tell them how to receive identifiers in

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,759
different databases you shouldn't ask

185
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
them to request

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,560
links in the advisor they requested it

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
they know everything they took

188
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,160
everything they inform about the

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
deadlines when they will have

190
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
publications when the patch will be

191
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
produced and just

192
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
before the page they will make a letter

193
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,840
okay dear researcher in the next week we

194
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,000
are going to make this patch which is

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,639
going to close your vulnerability please

196
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,720
keep it in mind so it's an ideal picture

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
and it happens once in a while so things

198
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
that you're telling me i think this is a

199
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
very mandatory minimum from from the

200
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,039
vendor to

201
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
make a link to the researcher to refer

202
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,440
to the researcher what's so good about

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
it can you make an example why is it so

204
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,039
good well

205
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,080
good side of it is that only few vendors

206
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,639
follow these good practices only few

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,919
vendors practically go through this path

208
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,360
and they've repeated it on several

209
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,759
occasions and right now they are ready

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,880
to reproduce this procedure

211
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,440
[Music]

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,720
on every situation that's why

213
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
it's it makes you happy when vendor does

214
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
everything properly

215
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
i cannot say that it happens every day

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
amongst the foreign banners russian

217
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
vendors no we should not differentiate

218
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,839
them

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
we cannot say who is better and who is

220
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,799
worse and we do have companies which do

221
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,039
everything properly within these

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
discovery vulnerabilities process from

223
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
their side so this is a process of

224
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,839
removal of vulnerabilities and speaking

225
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
about foreign companies they do they do

226
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,839
have a lot of companies like that and

227
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,600
they do it successfully so when you

228
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,200
write identification to the vendor that

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
you've discovered in their product

230
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
certain vulnerability

231
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
other certain live hacks or maybe

232
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
certain templates or forms how can you

233
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,839
write this notification is it a template

234
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,519
or maybe there's a certain requirements

235
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,480
object hello dude i've discovered this

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
in your program if you want i'll show it

237
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,600
to you

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
well it's always different it's always

239
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,519
different and it all depends

240
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
okay relatively speaking it depends on

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,160
the level of maturity of the vendor

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
his maturity in the process of

243
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
vulnerability of removal for example has

244
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,480
a big inflow of vulnerabilities from

245
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,200
researchers vendor does know how to

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
process them and they try to optimize

247
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
this process the most obvious thing is

248
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
to place the policies of vulnerability

249
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
discoveries which says how the

250
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
researchers should act if they find a

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,279
vulnerability in this vendor's product

252
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
and then they will have contact

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
information and this is the simplest

254
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
option of corporations for example you

255
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,480
google the name of the vendor

256
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,880
you google disclosure policy and

257
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
disclosure policy has all the

258
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
information the more complicated variant

259
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
is when they don't have this policy and

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
you have to apply skills of searching in

261
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,160
the internet at least to find any

262
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,040
context from them

263
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
okay we're going to call those things

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
with their own names

265
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
of course

266
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,839
you are searching for their even mail

267
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
for example one a chinese vendor was

268
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
reported through the sales they've

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
entered and by the way they've reacted

270
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,920
very fast to these sales at the same

271
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
time security of a certain mail they

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,560
don't have anything like it so if

273
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
you will come one time second time

274
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
through the sales and then they will be

275
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,600
able to roll out the page with policy of

276
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
disclosure of vulnerabilities how it was

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
happening with this chinese vendor

278
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
because in response to our letter after

279
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
a certain period of time

280
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,200
they've told us okay we've made this

281
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
page you will find the contact

282
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
information and if you will send

283
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,079
something please follow this link

284
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,600
this option

285
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
is also viable

286
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
then also the company is represented in

287
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
a certain bank bounty platform or the

288
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
link in this situation the platform

289
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,279
connects the company with the researcher

290
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,040
and with the help of the service or the

291
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
web formula

292
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,160
information about vulnerability is being

293
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
transferred from the researcher to the

294
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
vendors so they have to fill the certain

295
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
form you should provide them certain

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,720
detailed information

297
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
you write something or you just fill the

298
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
basic form well if you feel the basic

299
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
form under link

300
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,920
they do ask about some certain basic

301
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
things about vulnerability and then they

302
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
open a ticket within this ticket you can

303
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,160
communicate with the vendor

304
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
pro

305
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
well i'm going to tell you tomorrow

306
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
about it some fun cases when you could

307
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,440
report vendor to the back bounty

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
but then

309
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,880
the sanctions have influenced this

310
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
process and how we've been searching for

311
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,720
the way out of this situation so you've

312
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
been you're going to be speaking about

313
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
some fun cases how many of those fun

314
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
cases do you have well about 10 of them

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,600
can you give me one today once a day

316
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
just as a

317
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,600
teaser

318
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,079
okay

319
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,279
i will speak about the one that i wasn't

320
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,160
going to speak about uh tomorrow

321
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,200
it's a simple case it was a very tragic

322
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
case for us as researchers

323
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
at the same time we had a happy end for

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,880
the users

325
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
it's a sanction related story when we

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,639
try to get in touch with bender the

327
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,440
vendor does not get in touch with us we

328
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,000
are searching for this vendor to all the

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
channels we're writing to this vendor

330
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
then finally we find russian rep office

331
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
and we find a russian representative and

332
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,399
we say to them we send repo to your

333
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,839
headquarters organization nothing

334
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,800
happens

335
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
do you want us to send it to you so we

336
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,399
send it to russian rep office

337
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,839
we send a report and it was accepted to

338
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,600
our personal contacts and we've been

339
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
informed that this report have reached

340
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,480
their own research team

341
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
inside of the vendor company they've

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
looked at this vulnerability they found

343
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
it they were able to produce the patch

344
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,519
and then we've lost the contacts

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
for long it was continued for a certain

346
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,120
period of time but after a certain

347
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
period of time they came back to us

348
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,120
through this russian rep office and

349
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
they've told us

350
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,920
yes

351
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,199
we

352
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
have discovered this vulnerability we

353
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
have fixed it

354
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
so now users will be able to install the

355
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,839
update but we are not going to mention

356
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
you anywhere

357
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
yeah i wanted to hear this tragic story

358
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
yeah because the researcher wants to be

359
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
referred

360
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
because he needs to have a little piece

361
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,560
of glory after he has notified the

362
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
vendor that i've done his job at least

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,600
say things official things somewhere in

364
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
the news can you show my name or

365
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,160
whatever

366
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,880
i do remember you've been telling us fun

367
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
stories when you had to feel a

368
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
notification for the vendor so when you

369
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,279
submit information about vulnerability

370
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,120
to manufacturers or to the vendors

371
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,279
vendors should receive and give you cv

372
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,800
and you've been telling us how it was

373
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,120
happening

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
you give spoilers about tomorrow i want

375
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,680
to speak about it tomorrow please but

376
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
briefly speaking just in couple of words

377
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
without any details we have taught our

378
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
vendors

379
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,920
to receive cve for their own

380
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,760
vulnerabilities but tomorrow you will

381
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
have different

382
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
and more detailed information well

383
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
these can be automated and it would be

384
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
the right thing to do writing to do from

385
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
the point of view of researcher to

386
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,959
understand

387
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,760
but if bander denies you in getting this

388
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
id it's not always because they don't

389
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
want to sometimes it's just because they

390
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
don't know and you have to help the

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,279
vendor

392
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,160
okay can you give us three top three

393
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,199
advices for the researcher how to

394
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,600
properly you can prepare the vendor how

395
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
can you prepare your vendor how can you

396
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,959
teach the vendor to work with

397
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,040
vulnerabilities well the most important

398
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,680
thing is uh the human factor human

399
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
relations we need to understand that on

400
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,440
the other side we also have real humans

401
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
so should we send get pictures no it

402
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,600
could be the end of the communication

403
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
process and discovery of vulnerabilities

404
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
but in the beginning you should be very

405
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
serious but friendly

406
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
and so that on the other side on the

407
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,839
side of the vendor people also should

408
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,480
understand that you came to them not to

409
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
blackmail but as a human to another

410
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
human you want to share these

411
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,120
discoveries to make their product better

412
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
and safer

413
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
and i think this is a step number one

414
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,320
step number two well i have a question

415
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
please don't forget about the step

416
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
number two and three but i have a

417
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
question i work in the press

418
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,800
public relations department and my

419
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
working mail receives millions of

420
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,440
letters and sometimes i receive letters

421
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,720
like

422
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
well i have discovered certain

423
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
vulnerability in one of your whatever

424
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,079
can you reply to me well honestly i

425
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,800
think that this is fishing

426
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
and this is the end of my communication

427
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
with this address

428
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,279
you can redirect these letters to me and

429
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,360
i'm going to tell you whether it's right

430
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,800
or wrong so i should send them to you

431
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
copy me

432
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
if ask will approve it i will look at it

433
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,800
but

434
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,639
how can you write a letter so that you

435
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
wouldn't be considered to be a fishing

436
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,199
attack

437
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,400
first of all you have to introduce

438
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,559
yourself because when two people even on

439
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,319
the street when they want to get

440
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,160
acquainted with each other and ask

441
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,880
something from each other first of all

442
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,839
the

443
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,959
good command code who are you i'm this

444
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,160
and these days i do these this and these

445
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,280
so give minimal information about

446
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
yourself that can be checked

447
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
then you can start telling about some

448
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,319
things

449
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,799
and which

450
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,679
to the fact that you do know

451
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,080
about the product or you've discovered

452
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
vulnerability and some minimal details

453
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
yes it's understandable that you should

454
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
disclose all the information as a

455
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
researcher because

456
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
who knows

457
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
if as a researcher you have approached

458
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,720
the wrong person

459
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
and

460
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
maybe you're delivering information

461
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
about the zero-day vulnerability to a

462
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
wrong person it's not a responsible

463
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,480
approach

464
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,240
so first of all you have to build a

465
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,320
connect with bender and you should

466
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,919
understand that even on the side of the

467
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,960
vendor not everybody should know about

468
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,559
technical details of certain

469
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
the vulnerability way to do it would be

470
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
to find contacts of those people inside

471
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
of this vendor company who are involved

472
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,919
in

473
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,160
what removing vulnerabilities in their

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,400
products so this is advice number two

475
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,320
you should

476
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,880
try to specify why is he denying you

477
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,039
why don't they want to communicate with

478
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,400
you maybe

479
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,120
it's not a negative story one vendor

480
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,559
says well i don't want to deal with you

481
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,720
maybe they're afraid or maybe they miss

482
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
some information and you need to help

483
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,039
them because not every vendor knows

484
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,400
which place in in the total process they

485
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
take because in the process they have

486
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
users and sometimes vendors forget

487
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,919
because we do everything for the user

488
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,400
and sometimes perception of the user

489
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
inside of the vendor that well they can

490
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,559
buy a new piece of hardware it will be

491
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
more safe than the previous one with

492
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,559
vulnerability and let them do that it's

493
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,400
also irresponsible and you have to

494
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,280
explain this to vendor

495
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,799
you have to explain their position

496
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,280
towards the end users so

497
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,720
that they wouldn't lose connection

498
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
with reality

499
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,200
it's not just about making the money

500
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,280
well in the end run it's all about the

501
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,400
money okay can you tell me please in

502
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
recent years or in recent six months a

503
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,600
lot of things have changed in our lives

504
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
and in cyber security as well and

505
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,720
definitely these changes have involved

506
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,799
vulnerability operations i know that

507
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,960
there are new requirements uh from the

508
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,880
side of regulators about updates and how

509
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
can we build our work in these

510
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
conditions well i'll give you a

511
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,679
recommendation on how can one properly

512
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,480
test and update the software we still

513
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
develop those recommendations but

514
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,199
nevertheless the idea is following

515
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
by now we have faced a situation when a

516
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,039
number of western and not western

517
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,480
foreign vendors have left russia

518
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
at the same time

519
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,520
sometimes

520
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,080
the sales are continued or some

521
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
employees are staying in the offices

522
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,280
here

523
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,880
but product support has been halted

524
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
so basically speaking russian buyers and

525
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,000
russian company which uses these foreign

526
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,120
software or the hardware

527
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,520
they have based the situation that

528
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,960
support was stopped but the life had not

529
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
stopped and global researchers they find

530
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,520
vulnerabilities in those products and

531
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,960
they inform vendors about it bender

532
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
produces updates but these updates are

533
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
not coming to russian companies

534
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
and this is problem number one problem

535
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,159
number two

536
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
when these updates can arrive but they

537
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,039
can have some non-documented injections

538
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,159
or drawings or some destructive

539
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,640
components which

540
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
after this update will shut down the

541
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
software or the hardware it's not a nice

542
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
situation and we would like to have a

543
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,919
certain instruction we would like to

544
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,679
have a certain recommendation

545
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,120
which

546
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,919
the company could follow in order to

547
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,039
safely test this update before

548
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,720
installing it

549
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
that's what i'm speaking about thank you

550

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,559
does a russian

554
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,559
meet friend needs

555
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,559
to search and do we need to search

556
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
vulnerabilities in the open source well

557
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,679
but dean is going to tell you about it

558

559
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,159
