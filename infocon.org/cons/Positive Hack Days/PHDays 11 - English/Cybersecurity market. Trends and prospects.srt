let's begin um

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
is a very significant volume-wise

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,800
according to your assessment which you

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
provide to investors it's uh assumed on

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
the level of 200 me

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
billion rubles a year and this market is

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,600
represented by certain segments

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,040
and i would like to learn from you

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
can you speak about three four key

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
segments

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
can you tell us about the main trends

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,960
what defines the demand and supply

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
what other

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,720
perspectives of growth thank you very

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,680
much well very clear questions my

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
expertise in russian native security

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
market

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
i would say it's approximately 200

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
billion rubles and this is as of the end

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
of the last year

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
the main

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560
trend

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,720
and what is going to happen in this

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
market is related to recent events

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
that this market is being

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,159
big international players are leaving

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,320
this market they live they're leaving it

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,119
for a long time seriously they are not

44
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
promising to come back and even if they

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
have a desire to come back they will not

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
be accepted because the issues of

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
informational security has any security

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
the question of trust is very important

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
the company cannot stay defenseless

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
according to my expert opinion the

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
released segment of russian market

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
related with manufacturers which are

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,760
living or which have left russia i

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,879
evaluate on the level of 80 billion

55
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,640
rubles

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
the market which is getting freed and

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
everything that is happening right now

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,280
this niche is going to be failed by

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
other companies

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
they've had this business for the amount

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
of 80 billion rubles and this business

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
has left russia so somebody's been

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
asking you will the market grow in the

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,519
year 2022

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
i don't have answers whether it's going

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
to grow or not

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,560
but

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
precisely there is a niche

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
even to 80 billion rubles which is going

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
to be filled by other solutions and

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
first of all solutions of domestic

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
companies and if we will compare it with

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,159
the assessment of the volume of this

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
market it's approximately 40 of the

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
market so for domestic players even if

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
the market is not going to grow its

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
capacity is increasing by 40

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,800
because this niche is getting released

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
will russian players good quality and

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
reliable players be able to enter this

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
market reliably and sincerely

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,319
this is the challenge of today

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,480
the challenge to the industry of russian

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
cyber security

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
well you kind of answered on my next

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
question about the challenges of the

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,920
coming days

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,440
this market is much wider

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,840
russia is amongst top three

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,000
countries which have great potential

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
on the level of the country to offer

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
solutions which cover practically all

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
aspects of informational security

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
complete solutions resultative solutions

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
on the basis of manufacturers within one

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
country and russia from this point of

97
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
view has a unique situation

98
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
there are two other countries like that

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,840
united states and perhaps israel

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,160
iran previously we didn't have question

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
on this level because clients they've

102
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
been choosing something comfortable

103
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,240
something reliable

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
market leaders can you give us gartner

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
analytics we are going to look up upper

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
right quadrant but the world has changed

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
metrics have changed risks have changed

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,520
that's why these challenge in front of

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,199
the industry of russian cyber security

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,120
let's forget about competition

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
competition is a good story however

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
generally speaking we as a company of

113
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,960
russian cyber security we can form such

114
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,040
a solution which brings the company to

115
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
the final end result understanding that

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
the end result

117
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
is

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,440
guaranteed non-allowance of uh

119
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
impossible events and this is a

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,039
challenge of today this is something

121
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,680
around which industry of russian

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,440
cybersecurity is gathered around and

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
this is the main reason why our state

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
provides support to the industry of

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
information security

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
and this is the direction in which

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
regulators are looking at right now

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
it is obvious especially in the air of

129
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
protection of state public structures

130
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
different

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,360
uh public corporations cyber security of

132
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
this sector so can you tell me please a

133
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,680
little bit more about challenges it is

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
obvious that

135
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
vendor relations in cyber security area

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
and clients are built on contractual

137
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
basis and

138
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
after

139
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
a number of foreign vendors have left

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,479
the market we have to

141
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,840
rebuild

142
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
right now everything we have to change

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,240
everything

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
corporate clients that you work with

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
they have to change in the market which

146
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,280
difficulties do you see what really

147
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
happens right now because this process

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
have been started suddenly for everybody

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,759
and this is a great challenge in other

150
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,000
words these 80 billion rubles that were

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,199
released

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,919
on the market niche this is a big scale

153
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
amount

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,479
and the process

155
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
it's not very simple to switch to

156
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
another supplier

157
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
how can you describe this process it

158
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,160
cannot be a simple process which stages

159
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
should one go through in order to

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
achieve serious logical completion

161
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
it's a very big question we would like

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
to speak i would like to speak a lot in

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
reply to your question first of all if

164
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,759
previously

165
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,080
the word and processes related with

166
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
import substitution

167
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,720
they had a certain flow of something

168
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
imposed from above from the side of the

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
state or they want something

170
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,440
if there's a possibility to avoid this

171
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
then we better stay where it is

172
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
comfortable for all of us so this is

173
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
something that is

174
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
dictated from above something that is

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
imposed but right now situation has

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,039
changed especially banking sector

177
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,240
is a very powerful

178
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
and they've been playing as a big

179
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
coalition against initiatives of the

180
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,400
last year because everybody has

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
understood that these are not

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
hypothetical risks

183
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
these risks have already happened here

184
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,479
and now some solutions stopped working

185
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,080
other solutions

186
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,120
lost expertise

187
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,720
some of them have been removed from

188
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,039
technical support

189
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
but in the area of cyber security the

190
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,000
expertise which is provided by vendors

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,479
to products it's an integral part of it

192
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,720
and this is the most valuable because if

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,479
it will stop filling products with

194
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,960
expertise they will get outdated and

195
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
vulnerabilities are appearing every day

196
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
new hacking attack techniques are

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
happening every day and if you will not

198
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
update this knowledge database the

199
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
reason the product will become obsolete

200
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
so making resume up from the above

201
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,280
mentioned and everything that happened

202
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,599
on the market all clients all the

203
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
landscape of russian at market have

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
faced the situation that right now we

205
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,679
need to make a lot of serious steps in

206
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
the area in the direction of transition

207
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
to solutions which don't carry those

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
risks of simultaneous

209
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
departure closure of functionality

210
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,560
removal of technical support and this

211
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
initiative

212
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
i can use an ancient word this

213
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
initiative is a demand from allocations

214
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
not a requirement of the regulators not

215
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
the demand of the president that was

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,959
published one week ago

217
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
as of 1st of may

218
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
and defines the beginning of the year

219
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,560
2025

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
as that particular moment when we

221
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
shouldn't have any solutions from

222
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
unfriendly countries in the area of

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
cyber security and the

224
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
issue of cyber

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
replacement of uh

226
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
is not related with this particular

227
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
decree it's related with the situation

228
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
that we have faced in our home

229
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,959
losing a lot of solutions what happens

230
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,480
on the market

231
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
previously as positive technologies the

232
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
word import substitution we have not

233
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
even been looking this direction we

234
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
thought that we need to compete with

235
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
technologies we need to compete with

236
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
results and input substitution is a

237
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
kind of a doubtful story we we felt

238
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
uncomfortable to compete on import

239
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
substitutions we wanted to be selected

240
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
not because of impro substitution but we

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
wanted to be selected because people

242
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,240
like them because they solve and

243
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
objectives and we've been getting around

244
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
this topic yes we've been asking is it

245
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,200
helping yes it's helping

246
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,240
but right now things that we see that

247
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
every client

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,399
has formed at list of those

249
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,920
technological segments

250
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,079
which have been affected by this story

251
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,880
and where they have to quickly

252
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
move to some domestic analog

253
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
to domestic software and hardware and

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
clients are asking us okay can you look

255
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
at our it landscape can you look at our

256
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,000
landscape of security means and can you

257
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
tell us which of your technologies can

258
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,079
replace those vendors which are living

259
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,320
russian market and right now these

260
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
projects are being launched every day

261
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
you're absolutely right by saying that

262
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
it is impossible to

263
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
change one technology by another very

264
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
often

265
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,279
implementation of specific defense

266
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,800
measure requires changes in it landscape

267
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,200
very deep design and very through

268
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
thinking process and it's a very long

269
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,279
process it takes a lot of time that's

270
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,320
why

271
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
the period defined in the decree of the

272
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
president is defined as the year 2025

273
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
everybody says well 2025 this is three

274
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
years from now but you know

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,519
we are not going to be able to leave as

276
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,120
we live before and in this course of

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,839
three years we have to catch up to solve

278
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
this objective i think this is very

279
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
short period of time and very ambitious

280
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,200
objective

281
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
i believe considering the scale of

282
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
certain corporate clients

283
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
in the

284
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
technical economical and financial

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,519
sphere

286
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,480
large companies which have federal

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
presence

288
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,279
our company is involved in a supply of

289
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,560
software

290
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
selling licenses only through

291
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
partnership network so all our partners

292
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
they came to us with the landscape of

293
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
their own clients with product maps and

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,320
they are solving same objective in the

295
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
interests of clients and according to

296
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
their demand

297
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
they are discussing which technologies

298
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
which manufacturers

299
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
how can they be replaced by positive

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
technology solutions

301
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,399
i believe that

302
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
is one of the main beneficiaries

303
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
as pragmatic as it would sound

304
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,120
from all of this story first of all

305
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,880
positive technologies has 15 products on

306
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
the russian market and the amount of

307
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
this market segment

308
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
is above

309
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,000
than half of the released products and

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,279
that's why positive solutions are very

311
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,240
highly demanded today and very important

312
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,519
thank you very much okay let's switch to

313
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
your product plans to your product

314
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
strategy

315
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,399
for the next couple of years

316
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
how well corrected how well adopted was

317
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
it due to changes in the marketing

318
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,240
course of last two months which products

319
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,839
will stay as basis anchor products

320
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,639
which new products are being developed

321
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,399
by you or which products you are

322
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,360
planning to develop so how the situation

323
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,279
is changing

324
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,760
well positive technologies is a company

325
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,000
which was never making products for some

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
uh market niches well there are crypto

327
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
gateways the crypto gateways market is

328
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
one of the biggest segments okay let's

329
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
make a crypto

330
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
uh

331
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
gateway no we're not doing that we are

332
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
not making solutions for released

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,279
segments

334
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
how do we think in recent years we've

335
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,760
been driven by an idea

336
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
and we believe in the idea that the main

337
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,839
objective of cyber security is to make

338
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,399
inadmissible events to become impossible

339
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,639
and we have rebuild our product

340
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
portfolio including

341
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,760
existing products how are they ready to

342
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,880
solve this objective

343
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,360
so we have a certain sense to make

344
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,279
inadmissible events to become impossible

345
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,440
so we have 100 percent of pen tests

346
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
friendly break-ins we break everybody

347
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
are white hackers

348
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
zakat

349
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,279
so our clients

350
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,440
they have not learned in course of this

351
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
years to solve this problem honestly

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,760
they have not learned so we've said okay

353
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
let's take this task from them

354
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
let's give the positive technologies

355
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
give them possibility to make uh

356
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
inadmissible events to become impossible

357
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
we have wide head hackers we know how to

358
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,079
break we have security center experts we

359
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,240
know how to defend we know how to

360
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
investigate incidents we have analytics

361
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,560
we have developers we have products who

362
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,199
except for us so let's take it and we

363
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
took this crown we have reviewed the

364
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
roadmaps of all our products we have

365
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,120
understood which products were missing

366
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
to solve this objective and we started

367
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,279
making them

368
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,920
this year for example

369
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,120
we have already

370
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,680
launched xdr solution detect and

371
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
response solution we needed to solve

372
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
this top level objective

373
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
and to solve it we have created

374
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,600
meta product objective two and a half

375
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
years ago we have made this word before

376
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
the facebook have announced it meta

377
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,880
products max patrol o2 here it is it's

378
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,279
been sold on the stand of fights 10. you

379
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,120
can look at it you can use it and what

380
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,920
max patrol oh too what is it the problem

381
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,040
is not that we have not been putting the

382
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,079
proper

383
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
goals we have not been achieved

384
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
achieving our goals because

385
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
we didn't have enough of qualified

386
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
specialists and everybody's speaking

387
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
about it and they speak a lot about it

388
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,079
according to our expert assessment that

389
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
even in the smallest company

390
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
if you want to solve informational

391
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
security problem and good quality level

392
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
you need at least 25 experts not people

393
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,279
from the market but real experts and

394
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
such experts who will provide guaranteed

395
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,000
results to you and according to our

396
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
expert assessment on the market where

397
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,160
approximately 1 000 people 1 000. can

398
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,519
you divide 1000 by 25 you receive only

399
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,360
40 companies that can be defended what

400
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,199
about the rest companies we have a

401
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
question people are not scalable story

402
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
that's why we have an objective it's a

403
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,880
super ambitious goal to make autopilot

404
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,519
in a cyber security world let's make an

405
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
expert product of such a level such

406
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,279
smart ai which could discover and

407
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,600
prevent incidents instead of people and

408
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
this is max patrol oh to our product and

409
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,160
this is our product strategy

410
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,720
creation of such products and adoption

411
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,759
of remaining product portfolio for it so

412
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
that it could lift to the level of meta

413
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
products uh needed context to make

414
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
decisions so that it would perceive

415
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
management uh a level with meta level to

416
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
block criminals very often we say that

417
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,039
o2 has a lot of uh

418
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,079
understandings one is uh to discover and

419
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,520
to stop

420
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
and this is what we want to do with the

421
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
hands of one person it's not a story of

422
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
today we have a long

423
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
path ahead of us but this technological

424
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
development vector which right now is

425
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
driving positive technologies and this

426
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
is the direction we're moving to you

427
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,080
know in your reply you just have

428
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,600
mentioned an interesting topic about

429
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,039
how many specialists in the area of

430
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,200
cyber security we need especially for

431
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
the medium level companies compositive

432
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
technologies works with corporate

433
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,559
clients

434
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,039
most of the revenue is provided by big

435
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,600
companies

436
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,720
and there's a big pool of medium level

437
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,799
companies including your clients

438
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,440
can you tell us a little bit don't you

439
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
have an impression that demand from the

440
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
side of rush

441
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,679
medium level companies is not

442
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,360
sufficiently advanced not

443
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,320
everybody perceive cyber threats as real

444
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
business threats and that honestly

445
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,679
speaking this is not covered market for

446
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,000
companies like yours

447
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
it is obvious that big companies

448
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,919
cyber security threat is very obvious

449
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,240
for them and they require complex

450
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
solutions but medium segment and small

451
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,840
business possibly does not fully

452
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,280
understand this problem

453
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,919
and specifically especially in the light

454
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,080
of recent events

455
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,280
you know what i think

456
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
i don't think they don't understand but

457
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
all these large incidents especially of

458
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,799
recent months

459
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,799
database of gamma tests

460
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,840
yandex foods everything's in open access

461
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
why do we need to protect personal data

462
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
is everything has been leaked and here

463
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
it is should we stop doing that

464
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
that's why i think that from this point

465
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
of view

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,600
they see these risks

467
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,440
many people cannot allow themselves it's

468
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
very expensive it's not affordable for

469
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,200
many of them and the

470
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,400
segment

471
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
of our companies ministries departments

472
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
large corporations many companies cannot

473
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
afford it and this is a very niche

474
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
expertise very deep expertise with

475
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,080
expensive and rich specialists however

476
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,880
number three i think that the landscape

477
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,960
of russian business

478
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,000
business environment is very specific

479
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,080
and i think that this smb segment

480
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
is well expressed and it represents the

481
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,200
structure of russian economy so the

482
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,440
payable demand is

483
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,559
either

484
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,840
in large commercial companies private

485
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
banks or companies with public

486
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,520
participation or pure state companies

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,679
i believe that this is the main reason

488
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,120
why don't we see wide demand

489
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
from small medium businesses and

490
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
basically speaking this form of

491
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,159
operations that we offer to the market

492
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
is not for these guys

493
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
they need something simple

494
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,559
understandable i have developed a site i

495
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
have web application or a web base can

496
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,480
you give us some service simple and

497
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,960
understandable service let it be in a

498
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,039
data center or in the cloud let it be a

499
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,919
native uh let it be delivered i'll just

500
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,480
put it on the surface and these

501
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
solutions are being produced and we are

502
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,360
looking in the direction of clouds we

503
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
always been following those trends

504
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
previously because technologies are

505
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
moving in this direction unfortunately

506
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,960
russia from this point of view

507
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
unfortunately

508
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,960
cloud technologies here are behind

509
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,559
global trends

510
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,120
however because we understand that these

511
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,320
trends are available we constantly

512
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,799
do a lot of experiments we adopt our

513
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,000
products to be used in the clouds

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
microsoft avs

515
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,280
yandex cloud etc

516
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
so everywhere you will be able to find

517
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,840
our solutions but unfortunately we have

518
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,880
not found a payable demand in russia in

519
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,679
those sectors however we don't stop

520
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,159
making those experiments there's another

521
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,600
trend which pushes us in this direction

522
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,120
is a complexity with hardware platforms

523
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,640
it's very difficult to buy hardware

524
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
for products including positive

525
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,960
technologies products and many clients

526
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
prefer to buy service

527
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
so that they wouldn't have any problems

528
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
with the hardware and this is another

529
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
trend which pushes manufacturers

530
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,240
to

531
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,280
transfer their solutions and sell them

532
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
as services to mssp partners or transfer

533
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
and adopt them in clouds even though

534
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
these are corporate clouds

535
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
so my answer to this question is like

536
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,039
this

537
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,280
thank you very much for mentioning

538
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,919
deficit that everybody understand

539
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,320
especially hardware software complexes

540
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,039
and the government has paid very serious

541
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,559
attention to this problem

542
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
in the end i would like to speak about

543
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
this package of support of a general

544
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,200
russian i.t industry

545
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,000
and your companies are also under many

546
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,720
stimulating

547
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,440
instruments

548
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
can you say a couple of words about your

549
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,039
experience of using this package of

550
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,159
support

551
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,120
which was verbalized by the president

552
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,720
two years ago which measures became more

553
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,960
relevant for you which became active for

554
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,280
you and out of recent governmental

555
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,280
measures about support of developers

556
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,799
which of them you think the most

557
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,240
effective and important

558
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
we think

559
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,960
them to be effective we actively use

560
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
them we are one of the main

561
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,520
beneficiaries of these support measures

562
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
for example things that were announced

563
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,120
two years ago

564
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
zero profit tax yes we do that as a

565
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,120
company do you remember tax maneuver

566
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
how many votes

567
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,799
we're saying that it's a strange story

568
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
well as a positive technologist we're

569
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
saying that this is a real support

570
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,039
measure which helps us as for new

571
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,200
initiatives

572
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,000
of course i believe the most important

573
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,320
one is the access to cheap money

574
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
they've promised loans with three

575
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,760
percent interest rate this is extremely

576
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
important for at companies because this

577
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
liquidity and there's a certain

578
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
specifics of russian market that our

579
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
main profit is received in the q4

580
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
but all our costs are equally

581
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,120
distributed through the year so we have

582
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,640
in the middle of the year

583
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,120
we have this gap and we need money for

584
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
our development and this is a normal

585
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,159
story i think this is a very important

586
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,360
and valuable and right now we are

587
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,200
negotiating in order to understand how

588
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,360
can we realize it practically so if it's

589
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
going to be accessible for us we are

590
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
going to use it definitely and i believe

591
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,840
that government will do

592
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,320
a lot of things from their side to

593
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,120
support russian developers well this is

594
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
nice to hear

595
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,840
and most importantly it should work

596
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,799
for the good of companies and

597
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,120
for your business success thank you very

598
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
much for the interview

599
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
for very detailed answers thank you very

600
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
much for interesting questions
