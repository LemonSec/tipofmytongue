00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
difficult to sit down in one place for a

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,400
long time i hope that will get out do

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
mustafi narada that's me we'll talk

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,440
about the

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,199
image of a

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,480
modern

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
data center we'll tell you about our

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,079
dreams our implementations i'll tell you

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
about the company we are

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
at the ground floor our stand is there

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,240
downstairs uh one person came to me

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,920
yesterday he said i am here at the stand

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,280
of libero navitas i don't know how to

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
read it

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,640
and i said how to explain what is libra

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
navitas what on earth is that

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
and i know how to pronounce it

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
something of that kind close to harry

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
potter in latin it's free power

34
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
free energy and our his story is like

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
that liberal novitas is free power of

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,920
free people joined for a certain

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,439
goal our goal is uh

38
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,439
self-implementation

39
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
modern data centers

40
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,880
we live

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
partly in the past what we use now was

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
born long ago

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,119
what we see now

44
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,800
infrastructurally was born and built

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
long ago

46
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
what we use today was invented in the

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
70s and in the 80s and was built in the

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,400
90s

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
unfortunately this is the way modern

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,440
data centers in russia look like uh

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,560
somber gray buildings

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
maybe with some

53
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
better facade

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,319
it's um

55
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,680
rebuilt

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,599
old

57
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,239
warehouses and communication nodes

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,640
uh refurbished

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,720
buildings built for other purposes

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
data centers are built from sandwich

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
panels

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,480
because

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
we have to make it fast

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
fast construction fast connection we

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
didn't like it at all

66
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,000
and

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
we thought about what

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
we can do to change the paradigm and

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
we're going to tell you about it and we

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
hope

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,080
that tomorrow

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
everything will be different and will

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,519
live in excellent nice

74
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,040
data centers

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,840
not the ones we have now a data center

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
is an infrastructural

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
object our company

78
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
thanks god is big the biggest in the

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,920
world territorially

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
so the analysis shows that this that all

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
data centers are concentrated in the

82
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,480
european part of russia that is moscow

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
saint petersburg kazan nishini novgorod

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,920
just a few in the euros and that is all

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,519
to the east of the euros we don't have

86
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,480
any

87
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,360
good

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
data centers and to the west of saint

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
pete meaning

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
kaliningrad we don't have good data

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
centers at all people in kaliningrad and

92
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,400
vladivostok are the same i've never been

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,360
to vladivostok but i presume

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
that people there

95
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
like the same food the same clothes and

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
the same look

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
they have the same look as us and they

98
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,960
want to use the same

99
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,240
data center services as in moscow

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,120
they

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
don't have it and our project wants to

102
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
change the situation we want to provide

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
high quality services throughout the

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
territory of the russian federation

105
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
kaliningrad to vladivostok

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,720
data centers do evolve

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
they evolved as a system

108
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,840
from the moment they started to be

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,759
commercial they

110
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,600
are compared by

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
certain technical parameters like power

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,080
reliability

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
diesel generators

114
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
uninterrupted power supply it's

115
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
dumb it's not

116
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,560
related to people if you stop a person

117
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
red can file person in the street

118
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,400
and ask him what is data center data

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
center i don't know

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
something well

121
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,080
what does it mean how is it integrated

122
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
in the real life

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
it's unclear and we would like to change

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
this paradigm

125
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,280
people say that

126
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
somewhere a data center was built with

127
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
100 000 servers

128
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
and nobody knows why

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,039
we knows that banks are no longer the

130
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,400
places where you just store your money

131
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,680
they became ecosystems internet sites

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
stop to be just sites they are eco

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
systems

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,360
the largest bookshop amazon is an

135
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
ecosystem ali is an ecosystem ozone in

136
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
russia is an ecosystem

137
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
what is an echo system

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,639
an ecosystem is

139
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,560
relations between a lot of components

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,360
through a lot of parameters data center

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
is a dumb

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
combination of servers

143
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,800
server halls and engineering systems we

144
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
are all professionals we know what a

145
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,560
data center is

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
what do we have to do there

147
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,919
no one wants to visit there no one

148
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,840
wants to spend

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,919
his or her time there

150
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
um if possible we wouldn't visit such

151
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
centers at all

152
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
i mean commercial

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
data centers and not your

154
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
enterprise server halls we want to

155
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
integrate data center in the life of the

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,160
society data center is a nice

157
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,000
infrastructural object that can provide

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,599
good services

159
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
that you can use we want

160
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,000
this paradigm to be spread across our

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,639
society what is next then we saw

162
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,199
where the human being

163
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
is developing the human being is

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,039
uh focusing on beauty whatever it means

165
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,919
yes for some people it's blue for some

166
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
people it's green you can argue

167
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,120
which color is better

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
but if something is usable

169
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
convenient

170
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,039
cozy

171
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,160
that is good if it is not convenient not

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,879
comfortable people try to avoid it many

173
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,759
people use data centers why because

174
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
there is no other alternative just

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
because they have to use it not because

176
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
they want to use them if they had an

177
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,840
alternative they would use something

178
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
else

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,879
no doubt

180
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,919
our project is for data centers where

181
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,360
people and data work together

182
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
the project where

183
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
we focus on the people who work together

184
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,559
with the data

185
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,399
in one territory

193
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,959
people

194
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
work and create

195
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,040
when we started thinking about this

196
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,600
project and start discussing it many

197
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
people said

198
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
you want

199
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
a

200
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
data center you have to build it in

201
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,160
irkutsk why

202
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
the question is because

203
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
the power is the cheapest there

204
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
electric power is the cheapest

205
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
we believe that the data center is not

206
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
to consume electricity but to provide

207
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,320
services to the people and enterprises

208
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,519
and not to

209
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
just heat

210
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
the earth's atmosphere

211
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,240
in our cost structure

212
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,560
the power occupies from 16 to 22

213
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,560
of the total cost well yes that is huge

214
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,279
but they are not paramount and they do

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,000
not define the location of the data

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,560
center it's the people who define that

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,680
it's you and the enterprises what is

218
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
innovation

219
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,880
innovational here many processes are

220
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,560
robotic not automated but robotic

221
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
this is the place where you interact

222
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,160
with robots because robots enter our

223
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
lives

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
but they are not very popular now you

225
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,519
have few

226
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,640
places

227
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
in russia where you can see robots

228
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
in our data centers we have a lot of

229
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,760
robot assistants

230
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
for robot

231
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
waiters bringing food from vending

232
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
machines

233
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,160
robot assistants

234
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
who help

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,800
system administrators to bring servers

236
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,160
to the rack

237
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
it's not an easy task if you visited

238
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
commercial data centers

239
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,360
visit them please

240
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,399
so there is a server it

241
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
comes in

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
in a box and then

243
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
the server takes it into his her hands

244
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,399
and brings it physically to the wreck

245
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,560
but the server may cost a hundred and

246
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
fifty thousand dollars and more or he

247
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,519
can also put it on a

248
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
very primitive

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
trolley and

250
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
carry it

251
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
so we want robots

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
to do the job what do people

253
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,040
mean they need space

254
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
and in our

255
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
data centers we have a lot of free space

256
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
for the people to

257
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,360
generate good ideas

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
so that people could share those ideas

259
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
discuss them find

260
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,279
interesting solutions and ways to

261
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,920
implement those solutions that is the

262
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,519
essence uh when the pandemic started and

263
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,160
we all sat down at our homes using zoom

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,800
so we became hungry for human

265
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,920
interaction people is social people has

266
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,440
to have to interact with each other

267
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,399
and

268
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,959
in that interaction

269
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,320
new ideas are born we are in the

270
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
center of international trade

271
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
hermes

272
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,040
is the host thanks to him and we talk

273
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,959
about i.t

274
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,479
i dream about

275
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
that in in five years we can have the

276
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
same conferences in the moscow data

277
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
center with a whole with an exhibition

278
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,440
hall and uh the space for 2 000 people

279
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,600
in this hall

280
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
you can

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
place 2 000 people this

282
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,160
hall where we are can house

283
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
500 people

284
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
and it's full

285
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,040
up

286
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,279
so we

287
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
want to build a bigger space

288
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,279
to come to interact to share ideas

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,560
so

290
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,320
vedanta our exhibition hall in moscow is

291
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,240
for exhibitions

292
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,040
the

293
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,399
afl tower is the exhibition center the

294
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
freedom statue in new york is an

295
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,440
exhibition center we want also to build

296
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,519
an exhibition center for you to

297
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
demonstrate your ideas and

298
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,839
products

299
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,530
here you can

300
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,079
[Music]

301
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,399
see the robots which help a system

[Music]

307
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
the administrator cannot

308
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,639
remember where exactly he is because

309
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,680
everything is similar and there is no

310
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,360
one to ask where you are you walk along

311
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,959
the rows

312
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,680
call help desk here

robots help system administrator to come

to the right place at the right time

318
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,279
as i told you we presume

319
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
that people in kaliningrad and

320
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,519
vladivostok do not differ much from the

321
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
viewpoint of interaction between

322
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
themselves

323
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,839
and

324
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,639
the wish to consume high quality

325
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,360
services our concept architectural

326
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,680
concept means that

327
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,199
we must display common approach to all

328
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
our services across the country

329
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,160

fiber optic links between data centers

331
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
which

332
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,399
can

333
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,320
boost the level of iit services in the

334
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
regions of russia

335
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
as high as possible to the level that we

336
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,600
have in moscow and saint pete

337
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
and even here it's not that obvious

338
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
because we don't have two similar data

339
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,839
centers now each and every data center

340
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,560
has different geometry different

341
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
architecture and configuration and when

342
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
the company asks for data center

343
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,959
services

344
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,600
they have special people for each data

345
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
center we want

346
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,680
data centers to be standard if you buy a

347
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,079
service in sebastopol

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
come to moscow and find exactly the same

349
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,000
services as there why do we need

350
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
standard architecture when we

351
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
demonstrated the project to a number of

352
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
governors they say oh we like it we need

353
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,920
it because people have no place to come

354
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
together to sit down in the territory

355
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,199
where they live

356
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
uh

357
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,759
data center we don't call a

358
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,639
data center an i.t cluster because an

359
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,040
i.t cluster has a bad history because

360
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,000
money

361
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,199
was allocated for it clusters they

362
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
didn't work

363
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
and it

364
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,480
we want

365
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
a place where business

366
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,360
can develop and ideas can be generated

367
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,240
and shared open space

368
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
is something that we must have we must

369
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,560
have a lot of such spaces in moscow and

370
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,360
elsewhere and this is a very important

371
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,160
part of our overall philosophy the

372
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,279
project

373
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,040
uh is about building 15 new data center

374
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
from vladivostok to khabarovsk we

375
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,680
analyzed it from vladivostok to

376
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,480
kaliningrad sorry story

377
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,240
in those places

378
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,039
we have to locate our data centers one

379
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,359
data center has a

380
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,640
range of influence

381
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
each person has about eight meters that

382
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,319
he can

383
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,760
affect

384
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,839
each data center

385
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,359
has a larger

386
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,880
area about a thousand kilometers across

387
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,559
and all the customers who are within the

388
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,600
100 kilometer radius

389
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,639
can operate with this data center

390
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
so and we can cover almost

391
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,600
all

392
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,440
the territory of the russian federation

393
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
at the end of our project in moscow the

394
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,440
data center is 200 2 000 wrecks in the

395
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
region 500 wrecks

396
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
and overall capacity

397
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,600
of the project is 9 000 new rex 18

398
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,080
000 kilometers of fiber optical cables

399
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,880
capacity is about 20

400
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,679
kilowatt per wreck there are different

401
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,039
opinions some people say

402
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,880
the data centers need higher power per

403
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
rack others said no

404
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,679
five to three kilowatts per rec we shall

405
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,120
wait and see

406
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
it's we say up to 20 kilowatts

407
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
it's it may be different then

408
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
is there

409
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,360
the market for data centers in russian

410
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,559
we opened spark

411
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,360
2021 we looked at the companies

412
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,160
uh

413
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
with the revenues of one

414
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
billion and higher

415
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
it showed us that

416
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,039
the companies

417
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,000
with

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,360
uh from one to five billion

419
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,240
they need three to five racks

420
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
five billion five racks

421
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,840
we extrapolated

422
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,120
it for

423
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,919
russia and we need 126

424
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
000 racks

425
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,400
to satisfy

426
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,760
the demand

427
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
of the russian federation in rex

428
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,160
stemming from company revenue what we

429
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,480
have now is 45 000 racks these are all

430
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
the racks installed in russia ros

431
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
telecom data line everything taken

432
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,960
together 45 000

433
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
the

434
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,039
deficit is about 80 000 racks

435
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,840
our project will give

436
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,240
the country 9 000 rec that is 10

437
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
of the

438
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
deficit or 5

439
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
of the demand

440
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
when we developed the project we

441
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
realized very well that we have to sell

442
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,799
it quickly

443
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,159
and we didn't talk about 120 000

444
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
our target is 9000 only

445
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
the cost

446
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
uh

447
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
some gloves light of the question how

448
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,480
much

449
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
if you have any guesses

450
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,760
so

451
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,039
please

452
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
what do you think

453
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
so how much

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
bit

455
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,919
15 data centers

456
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
and

457
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,360
fiber optics between them 96 billion

458
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
rubles

459
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,840
plus minus of course but in general

460
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,240
96.5 or 0.4

461
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,200
for 15 data centers with excellent

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,440
fiber links

463
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,520
100 billion rubles

464
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,520
is it a lot or is it not a lot

465
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,520
billions are quite abstract

466
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,600
so you remember 2018

467
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,480
the

468
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,159
football world cup

469
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,600
i visited it personally i visited it in

470
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
two cities

471
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
96 billion

472
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,080
is the cost of five stadiums built

473
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,960
for

474
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
that

475
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,440
world cup but the total number of

476
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,520
stadiums was 18 18 stadiums was built

477
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,640
for that championship

478
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,520
96 billion is

479
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
40

480
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,159
of the crimea bridge

481
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
in the russian federation

482
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
we have a lot of projects which are much

483
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
more expensive

484
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
than

485
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,670
then

486
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,080
[Music]

487
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
the project that we

488
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,360
propose and that project is quite

489
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,880
valuable

490
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,919
it brings it will bring a lot of value

491
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,720
and it brings in

492
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,400
socialization of data

493
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
services for example

494
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
we all have excellent smartphones

495
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
and they have

496
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,000
government

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
services

498
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,039
and

499
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,799
we consume about 150 government services

500
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,840
through our smartphones when my friend

501
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,799
went

502
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,159
to the u.s

503
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
he said well i had to recall how to fill

504
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,559
in the forms manually

505
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,559
so i never saw such number of paper

506
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,400
documents in russia we have good quality

507
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,280
of

508
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,159
digital service consumption

509
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,320
we provide digital service delivery

510
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,080
sources of finances

511
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,280
you can ask the government for money and

512
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,320
get the government owned

513
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,039
data center network it's not bad it can

514
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,000
be done

515
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
but we like commercial

516
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
story better because in the commercial

517
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,400
story it's you who decide the shape

518
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,440
of the data center its services its look

519
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,679
so we hope to

520
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000

is eight meters

542
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
so look at everyone around

543
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
