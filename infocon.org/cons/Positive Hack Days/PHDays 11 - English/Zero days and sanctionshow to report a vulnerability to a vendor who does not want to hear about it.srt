1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,960
of the vulnerabilities found by our

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,960
researchers

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,960
that

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,920
april last year our company was uh

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,160
slapped with american sanctions and this

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,519
has

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,279
resulted in some changes in how we

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,960
informed the vendors who put

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,559
some vendors really don't have much

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,200
experience in terms of uh talking to

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,800
researchers who

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,239
want to tell them about their

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,840
vulnerabilities and

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,280
even suggest ways of overcoming them

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,160
so

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,840
there may be a host of issues when

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
you're dealing with vendors

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
trying to tell them about their bones

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
and you probably understand that with

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,120
sanctions that have recently been

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
slapped on russia

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,359
it has become even more interesting so

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,039
i've got some

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,959
experience to share with you

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,360
and some recommendations that may be

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
useful

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,360
first thing let me check

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
we actually have researchers in audience

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
who are looking for vulnerabilities

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
and reporting them to vendors uh

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
binaries so web applications or what

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,040
have you done

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
raise your hands if you have ever

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
reported vulnerabilities okay good it's

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,119
good

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,679
yes

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
now let's check

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
do we have people who actually

39
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,600
know how the process works

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
maybe you're running your own projects

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
and you know you want to learn more

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
about the bugs so maybe you have a bug

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
bounty program

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,680
raise your hands if you belong to this

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
crowd

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
not too many fewer handstands before

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,920
maybe some people are being shy

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
now why am i talking about these two

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
categories

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
well here in the slide i'm also talking

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,560
about regulators and certs and measures

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,519
these are three groups they actually

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
know where they stand what their role is

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,760
what kind of information is coming to

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
them and what kind of information

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
they're going to share with the others

57
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
but the researcher and the vendor

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,239
if any of them is not

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,000
really experienced

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
may easily fail to

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
know what to expect from the other party

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,319
and what's the expectations there

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,160
what kind of information needs to be

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
when it comes to vulnerability

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,599
disclosure naturally it all starts when

66
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,040
the researcher discovers the

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
vulnerability and this effectively

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
triggers

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
a moral dilemma

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
on the internet you can find mattresses

71
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,120
like this but effectively there are

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
three options

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,760
one is to keep the disclosure in secrets

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
this is what uh

75
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
hackers or

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,959
law enforcement agencies do you know

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
they don't tell anybody about it they

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
use it until somebody else discovers and

79
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
patches

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
and full disclosure the inverse of this

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,840
is

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
this is where you actually talk about it

83
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,640
on github you publish a post you

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
record a video with poc

85
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
you keep your crime and this is when you

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
know cyber criminals

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
another malicious actress they grab your

88
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,000
plc

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
and they start adopting it for

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
exploitation purposes and they start

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
attacking companies with it

92
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,319
understanding that the patch

93
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,439
is obviously not out yet

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
at the same time

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
the number of attacks is mounting and

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,199
security corporations are saying uh

97
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,079
exploiting you know malware in the wilds

98
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
exploiting this vulnerability

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
and the vendor is usually suffering a

100
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
major hit to their reputation

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
naturally the truth is somewhere in the

102
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,919
middle it could be responsible or

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,680
coordinated disclosure the difference

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
between them is not that important

105
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,680
really it's functional but it does exist

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
the vulnerability and informs the vendor

107
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
about it and the vendor analyzes it

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
analyzes it and goes about patching it

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
but

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,039
what does responsible disclosure look

111
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
like when we do it and this

112
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
would be

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
in our case

114
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
so if you are considering doing bug

115
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
hunting

116
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,160
or you know if you want to

117
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,479
communicate a vulnerability to a vendor

118
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,440
in a

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
morally upright in a responsible way

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
this is what you need to do

121
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
well first you need to get in touch with

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
the vendor right

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,400
if the vendor is mature

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,759
now very often you can actually find a

125
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,840
vulnerability disclosure policy policy

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,638
on their website

127
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,880
[Music]

128
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
on a page like this you will find a

129
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,919
specific

130
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,520
set of instructions

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
could you get in touch with what kind of

132
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
report to provide what the status of

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
what the deadlines are

134
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
if the vendor is not mature

135
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
probably there won't be any policy like

136
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
this and the question arises how do you

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
report it to them well first you need to

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
find their contact details

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
so you get in touch with them you notify

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,840
them

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,039
i actually

142
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,199
suggest that at the same time you inform

143
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,080
the russian regulator

144
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,479
why this is the case i should tell you a

145
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,880
bit later

146
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
so once you have informed the vendor and

147
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,840
the regulator

148
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,160
you know there is this uh whole issue of

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
sending a report in should you encrypt

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
it or not

151
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,319
it may happen that the vendor will not

152
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
understand your report in single go and

153
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
they may ask you for a demo and you may

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
want to stay in touch with them

155
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,800
you know it's pretty easy to get

156
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
confused in this soup of uh text and

157
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,400
screenshots

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
and after the patch is released you know

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
vendor will probably issue an id for the

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,039
vulnerability this is done automatically

161
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
by russian regulators and after that you

162
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
may want to present at the conference

163
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
talking about your research or maybe do

164
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,280
a publication and again you may want to

165
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
inform the vendor that you are planning

166
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
to do that

167
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
you can discuss it with them after the

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
fix is released

169
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
or you can do it before i mean not the

170
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
presentation itself but rather

171
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,160
your discussion

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
and again you're expected to stay

173
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,280
responsible

174
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
and keep mum about the vulnerability

175
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
before it's fixed

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
so this is how we recommend that you

177
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
communicate vulnerabilities but

178
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
naturally things can go wrong at pretty

179
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
much every stage and i'm going to

180
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
illustrate it

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
with real life cases from our own

182
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
experiences

183
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
there is this european vendor you know

184
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
quite experienced when it comes to

185
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,199
vulnerability management we found their

186
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,840
vulnerability disclosure policy on

187
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,360
hacker one

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
and it says like if you have american

189
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
sanctions slapped on you you are not

190
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
allowed to talk to us about

191
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
vulnerabilities

192
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
and you know it may be a hard blow to a

193
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,640
researcher

194
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
another person has been working pretty

195
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
hard to identify those vulnerabilities

196
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
in the first place

197
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
it's important to remember that you know

198
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,880
there are human beings working for the

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
vendor

200
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,399
you know you can talk sense into them

201
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
so we found the people in charge of

202
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
product security we got in touch with

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
them and asked them like if uh

204
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,959
if they want to do anything about it

205
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,720
because that we cannot report it to you

206
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,519
using hacker one

207
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
but you have other ideas

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
like we were

209
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
we were you know prepared to send all

210
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
the information to them via email

211
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
and they said

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
let us get in touch with you

213
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
and you know two hours later they read

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,320
it

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,399
they edited their policy on hacker one

216
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,800
they completely removed this

217
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
paragraph about sanctions so some

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,959
vendors are actually flexible enough

219
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,880
they are prepared to change their

220
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
vulnerability disclosure policy if they

221
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,160
see that it benefits them

222
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
this is my recommendation to vendors you

223
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,279
know if you have a researcher

224
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
talking to you

225
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,399
and telling you that you know there are

226
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,040
circumstances

227
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,760
i'm sorry to which they cannot report

228
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
their vulnerability your vulnerability

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
rather in the usual way

230
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
please pay attention

231
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
so if you have read this

232
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
policy and you've realized that for some

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
reason you're not allowed to do it the

234
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,279
usual way still get in touch with the

235
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
vendor

236
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
all the good vendors

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,399
will want to make their products more

238
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
secure and thus take better care of

239
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,720
their users

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
and that would be actually the next case

241
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
i'm gonna tell you about it but they

242
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,360
won't have

243
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
um

244
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
vulnerability disclosure policy we still

245
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,518
want to contact them right

246
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
so with this particular japanese vendor

247
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
we've been trying to find their contacts

248
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,360
for a long time it's an open source

249
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
product it's available on github where

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
we couldn't find their contact details

251
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,959
and it was a significant vulnerability

252
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
we didn't want to communicate it to the

253
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
whole market on github

254
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
so i had to use some of my awesome

255
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
skills and i was able to find the right

256
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,920
person on twitter

257
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,440
i couldn't send a message to him

258
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
directly on twitter

259
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
but i found his latest post and i added

260
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,720
a comment there say well i'm such and

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
such i found a vulnerability in your

262
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,279
product

263
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,959
do get in touch

264
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,680
well it's japan right time difference i

265
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
i get a message here during the night

266
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
hello thank you very much he added me as

267
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,440
a friend so that we could see no

268
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,839
exchange messages directly

269
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
and you know

270
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,399
the issue was successfully resolved

271
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
i mean the vulnerability was patched

272
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,399
[Music]

273
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
if you like a

274
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
details for security matters ideally

275
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,279
you would want to have a dedicated

276
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
mailbox

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
and if you do have a dedicated mailbox

278
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,519
please make sure you check it okay

279
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,200
and my recommendation to researchers

280
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
you know if you have not been able to

281
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
find a contact

282
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,279
of the vendor

283
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,880
well you can ask

284
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,399
your friends to know something about

285
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
austin to help you maybe they know how

286
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
to google for information

287
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
they may want to find for example the

288
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
founder of the company

289
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
particularly if it's a small

290
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,880
a small product you know coming from you

291
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
know a loan developer then the founder

292
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,440
is the right person to talk to

293
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,959
you know very often you know you can

294
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,480
find the phone number and you can just

295
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
you know call him and tell him

296
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,959
this is uh this is no fraud i'm a

297
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,760
security researcher i want to report

298
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
this vulnerability i have been having a

299
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
hard time finding otherwise

300
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
so

301
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,600
[Music]

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,639
i found a vulnerability in a product of

303
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,320
an international firm headquartered in

304
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
taiwan

305
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
i found you know a lot of emails that

306
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
you know have words like security in

307
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
them we send messages to all of them you

308
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
know europe

309
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,639
russia

310
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
maybe they thought well we are under

311
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
sanctions so we shouldn't really talk to

312
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
them but we got a message from this

313
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
russian support they said we are not

314
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
interested we don't care about

315
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,079
vulnerabilities

316
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,560
get lost

317
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
i'm thinking well maybe they've

318
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,760
misunderstood something

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
so i found a live chat in their

320
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
ticketing system i get in touch with the

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
russian support people um

322
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
and i get the same kind of response we

323
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,519
are not interested

324
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
i'm not even sure if i'm talking to a

325
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
human being or a robot

326
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
so i'm calling the moscow

327
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
and there a person takes the phone says

328
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
according to my management we are not

329
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
interested what do i do

330
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
well if you're a vendor obviously never

331
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
ever do those things okay accept the

332
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,680
report

333
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
check it out and decide if it is

334
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
critical for you or not

335
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
because it may turn out

336
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
that the vulnerability is critical

337
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,920
and if you turn the researcher down he

338
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,360
will be insulted and he will publish it

339
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,199
and then you know what it means

340
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,720
exploitation

341
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,279
numerous attacks

342
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
corporations and users getting targeted

343
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
and your reputation as a vendor

344
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
jumping off the cliff and also the

345
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
regulator maybe

346
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
asking you questions and wondering why

347
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,279
you have not reacted to the

348
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,399
vulnerability reports

349
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
so in situations like this my

350
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
recommendation is to get in touch with

351
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
the certs responsible for the same

352
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
region or the same industry as the

353
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
vendor

354
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,000
and you should also inform the russian

355
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,079
regulator if you are a russian company

356
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
because together with

357
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
they should be able to

358
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,279
design some compensatory measures

359
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,680
so at least you know russian companies

360
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,560
should be able to beef up their defenses

361
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
even if the vendor is not doing anything

362
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,160
like in this case you know the vendor

363
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,240
has started the report

364
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,079
and eventually they get back to you and

365
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,519
they say

366
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
well it's a serious issue but we don't

367
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,959
know how to address it

368
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
there are actually two cases here in one

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
case the vendor told us

370
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,639
this product has been developed by a

371
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
team that no longer works for us

372
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
it's a legacy product

373
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
we are developing a new device now which

374
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
will be running new firmware

375
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,079
and we are already telling all our

376
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
clients do not buy the old stuff

377
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
and this vulnerability you know will

378
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,719
stay in the legacy

379
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,600
another case started

380
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,959
just the same way

381
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
but it ended differently

382
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
you know in the second case we got in

383
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,720
touch with the japanese cert

384
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
and together with the vendor and the

385
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
search

386
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,120
we found a way to compensate for this

387
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,320
problem

388
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
so we came up with the recommendations

389
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,319
for

390
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,000
so that was effectively an ics uh

391
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,279
solution

392
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
so we said well you know we at pt have

393
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,160
got a solution for that

394
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,160
um

395
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,320
doesn't really know the structure of the

396
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,680
old products or alternatively

397
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,720
the products

398
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,120
the old

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,959
security was not an important concern

400
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,640
for this industry

401
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,359
like for ics stills you know thinking a

402
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,839
long time ago

403
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,359
you know we control the physical access

404
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,559
why should we protect it

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
we are saying now

406
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,640
that in essence

407
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
you know industrial control systems are

408
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
linked to the internet

409
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,799
one way or the other

410
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,679
infrastructure and therefore external

411
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,000
attacks you know do gates get your ics

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,840
now we're effectively saying that

413
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
worth his salt will be able to get

414
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
access to your ics

415
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,879
and trigger the unmentionable

416
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
some technical aspects of your

417
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,760
operational processes are

418
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,240
usage of a particular protocol which by

419
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,840
design was insecure

420
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,360
and it's impossible to improve it

421
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,719
because otherwise you will lose

422
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,520
like this

423
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
can choose to at least publish

424
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
recommendations because they cannot

425
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,559
patch it and no recommendation to the

426
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,918
researcher in a case like this

427
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,960
if you are trying to actually solve this

428
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,919
problem by selling new devices this is

429
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,320
not user friendly this is what chinese

430
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,880
vendors like doing but unfortunately

431
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,320
russian vendors

432
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,918
also have the same propensity

433
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
so you have submitted your report and

434
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
the vendor has said yes i am going

435
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,720
to respond to it

436
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
well this is a particular case that

437
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,559
really struck me

438
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,799
everything seemed to be okay we reported

439
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,240
it to this particular chinese vendor

440
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,400
the reportedly

441
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
so they've been looking at it they've

442
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
been trying to fix it for like three or

443
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,559
four months

444
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,080
and then they get in touch with us and

445
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,640
they say everything is great you know

446
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
this vulnerable component we have fixed

447
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,360
it

448
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,199
and the new version is like this

449
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
we don't really know

450
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,919
how to deploy it because

451
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,919
you know before we deliver it to users

452
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,559
we need to test it and the testing scope

453
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,840
is colossal and we don't have the

454
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
resources for that

455
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
and we don't really know

456
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
when it can potentially happen i mean

457
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,360
both testing and updating

458
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,320
isn't that weird like they fixed it but

459
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,080
their users are not

460
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
getting the benefits of it

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
i'm asking them oh guys are you really

462
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
sort of simulating it

463
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,690
just like in the previous case

464
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,840
[Music]

465
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
i recommend that you inform the local

466
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
regulator and the cert in question so

467
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
that at least some companies are

468
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
protected

469
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
and my advice to vendors is private

470
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,919
resumes is you know what they do if you

471
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,640
are serious about it make sure that the

472
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
patch finds its way to the users

473
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,679
next stage

474
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,640
it has been communicated to the users

475
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
what's

476
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
well-known companies well-known products

477
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
so i'm not going to drop any names

478
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,320
in both cases

479
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,880
where reported vulnerabilities like 10

480
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,120
p.m and lunchtime next day they already

481
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,799
released fixes

482
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,360
colossal isn't it

483
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
you know in the first case the vendor

484
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
got back to us with a cv

485
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
time later

486
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
and in the second case they said we're

487
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,320
not going to share this cv with you

488
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,678
and i talked to researchers

489
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,000
and they told me well we did warn you

490
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,720
didn't we that's you know

491
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,360
they didn't give us cvs previously

492
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
either and i'm asking the vendor why

493
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
aren't you giving us a cve

494
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
and they tell me we actually don't know

495
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,559
how to do that for sure i mean

496
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,559
okay

497
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
how to get cvs

498
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
for your bugs because in this way

499
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,360
you know you benefit you have a

500
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
well-trained employee we benefit we have

501
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
a cv in our name

502
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,679
well it took a week-long

503
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,720
negotiation at the level of the ceos but

504
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,640
finally the agreement was reached

505
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,559
so after we created a

506
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,280
task force we got a cde in a week

507
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,039
and you know it was done perfectly you

508
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,159
know advisory and researchers names were

509
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,320
mentioned as many times as they should

510
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
uh

511
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
my recommendation here

512
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,840
to the vendor

513
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,240
phase like this

514
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
and you deploy the patch but please

515
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,559
remember that for the researcher the

516
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,039
process isn't over the researcher is

517
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,760
waiting for your thank you

518
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
in the shape in the form

519
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
of a cv id because they add it to their

520
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
portfolio and they boast to their

521
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
friends

522
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
you know with russian regulators it's

523
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
different you know they will get back to

524
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
you with the id

525
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,360
after you've informed them

526
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,760
but you know with cv ids

527
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
and i'm telling you all this because

528
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,960
this is my raw experience you can say

529
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,919
well as a researcher i can send a letter

530
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,240
to my and ask them for an update

531
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
you do remember that we are under

532
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
sanctions now and maitreya is no longer

533
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
talking to us

534
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,320
you know since april we've been sending

535
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,360
them letters which never gets

536
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
answered

537
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
now we know that you know if we still

538
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
want to get our cv ids we can do it

539
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,080
through the vendors and if the vendors

540
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,960
are responsible

541
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,520
it happens seamlessly they know that

542
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
they need to publish an advisory and

543
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,360
mention the you know nice

544
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,639
people who actually helps them

545
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,279
russian veterans

546
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,880
may find themselves in a similar

547
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,159
situation

548
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,799
and you know what they told me please

549
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,200
give me an estimate of how many man

550
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
hours this whole process is going to

551
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
take place

552
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,640
well i am going to teach them as well

553
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,039
because getting cvi is just possible

554
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,279
it will not be seen as a weakness by the

555
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,120
market it will be seen as a strength

556
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,520
that you know how to go about

557
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
vulnerabilities um

558
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,279
yeah you will be good and like i said

559
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,480
researchers should not get frustrated

560
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,039
or should not you know run away crying

561
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
when they're not giving a cd id

562
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
maybe the problem

563
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,799
is that the vendor simply doesn't know

564
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,799
how to do that or you may even want to

565
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,400
help the vendor fill the form out

566
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,960
when the vendor knows exactly what needs

567
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
to be done

568
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
no confusion we have this case with the

569
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,720
japanese vendor so despite the sanctions

570
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
by the way

571
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,360
this uh japanese company has been almost

572
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,399
happy to work with us

573
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
so the point i was trying to make is

574
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,240
that the vendor here

575
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
is sort of ahead of us

576
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,720
we didn't have to ask them for a cve id

577
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
for announcements or whether they were

578
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
going to mention us in the advisory or

579
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
not you know we've uh taught them about

580
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
the vulnerability they got back to us

581
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,279
and they told us okay we are going to

582
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
publish this advisory and that advisory

583
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,559
and then that type this advisory and yes

584
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,240
are all the names we need to mention

585
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
listed in your report thank you very

586
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,760
much and about a week before the

587
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,760
publication

588
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
they got in touch with the researcher

589
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,159
they said well dear researcher we are

590
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
going to publish the advisory do you

591
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,640
want to make any press releases

592
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
at the same time and in the end they

593
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,120
they gave us these cvs

594
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
my advice to the vendor in a situation

595
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
like this

596
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,520
may sound like a toast

597
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,279
i certainly wish inventors like this

598
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
enough energy to maintain such a

599
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,640
beautiful elegant process at the same

600
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
level

601
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
and my advice to the researchers is that

602
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,080
they should remember

603
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,159
that there are living breathing human

604
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,559
beings working on the other side of the

605
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,760
barricades

606
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
and they will really love it if you

607
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,720
thank them for their great job done like

608
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
if you enjoyed communicating with them

609
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,360
about the vulnerabilities please do not

610
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
forget to thank them

611
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,480
because not every vendor is like this

612
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
so these is have covered the way we've

613
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,799
been reporting and vulnerabilities of

614
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
the past year and the bottlenecks we

615
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,480
experienced yes we are laboring under

616
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,760
sanctions but

617
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
it's not that horrible really as long as

618
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
it's a single company when a whole

619
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,919
country is under sanctions

620
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,679
that's a slightly different case i mean

621
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,679
you may be asking yourself shall i even

622
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,240
report it

623
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,880
[Music]

624
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,799
now it may not be obvious to some people

625
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
you know foreign corporations have left

626
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,279
the russian markets

627
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
they are no longer supporting

628
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,879
their russian customers

629
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
and at the same time

630
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,399
they are claiming that they've preserved

631
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,919
their jobs

632
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,600
which is not really the case you know

633
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
they're no longer supporting the

634
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,360
software for example this is understood

635
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,679
not just by us this is understood by the

636
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,720
hacktivists and cyber criminals

637
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,880
they understand that after a company

638
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,399
publicly announces they've left the

639
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,960
russian market and if after that they

640
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,279
publish some advisory that you know we

641
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,399
have

642
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,600
removed

643
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
a critical vulnerability

644
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,640
good cyber criminal will realize okay

645
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,760
it's a shame they found this

646
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,600
vulnerability but russian customers are

647
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,640
not going to get the patch for it

648
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,039
let's do an exploit let's mount

649
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,360
you know he's

650
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,960
slightly different for open source

651
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
software because for open source

652
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,919
software you can do code review

653
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,840
so a russian company will be able to see

654
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,399
an update for some open source software

655
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,000
download it and then run it and audit it

656
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,399
using its own infrastructure um

657
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,760
reported

658
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
reported

659
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,279
you know trying to build infrastructure

660
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,120
for this discussion of whether russian

661
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,880
companies would want to report

662
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
vulnerabilities today or not

663
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,559
as a russian researcher

664
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,799
you should be aware that when you

665
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,279
communicate a vulnerability to a foreign

666
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,679
vendor

667
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,799
you may suffer

668
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,919
as you know an end user of say logistics

669
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,919
so transportation companies retail

670
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,960
companies or a government services

671
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,480
for example

672
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,840
if uh

673
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,080
cashiers

674
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,000
cash stations stop working at your

675
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,640
favorite groceries this is a potential

676
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,840
outcome

677
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,279
of a vulnerability disclosure

678
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,559
what shall we do

679
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,320
i've been mentioning the russian

680
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,840
regulator

681
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,480
fstc has many functions one of which is

682
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,919
to inform russian companies of

683
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,440
vulnerabilities

684
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,799
so if you have discovered a

685
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,480
vulnerability and you are wondering what

686
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,600
to do about it going forward

687
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,240
you should inform the russian regulator

688
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,120
because fstec is going to inform the

689
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
russian companies and together with you

690
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,200
they will develop recommendations and

691
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
compensatory measures

692
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
so even if you are not going to report

693
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,440
or you are going to report to an

694
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
international vendor at least

695
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,640
you know you've

696
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,320
given an opportunity for russian

697
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,919
companies to protect and defend

698
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:56,880
themselves

699
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
they will at least know that an update

700
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,679
is uh going to happen one day and they

701
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,640
should be looking forward to it

702
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,880
and by the way if you decide to stay

703
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,399
anonymous to an international vendor

704
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,440
you may want to contribute your uh

705
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,200
report your vulnerability to an

706
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
international vendor without disclosing

707
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
your personality fstc can actually do

708
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,480
that for you

709
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,479
please remember the bug bouncy programs

710
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
you know they may be thinking that

711
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,799
hacker one

712
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,240
is the other way

713
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,960
blue has decided not to collaborate with

714
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
russian researchers

715
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
moreover they've stopped the suspended

716
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,880
bug bounty programs of russian

717
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,440
corporations

718
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
which means that black bounty

719
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,440
western black bounty platforms seem to

720
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
be inaccessible to russians at the

721
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,440
moment

722
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
you probably know that russian black

723
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,840
bounty programs will be released this

724
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,960
year

725
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,880
including a bug balancing program which

726
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,679
is part of a standoff 365 there should

727
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,840
be a link please all right so this is

728
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
link

729
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,679
your company

730
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,360
programs are designed to bring

731
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,440
researchers and vendors together

732
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,360
so they do you know coordination and

733
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,240
operational support

734
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,840
which brings me to the end of my

735
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,720
presentation where i would like to

736
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
summarize by giving recommendations both

737
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,240
to vendors and researchers

738
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,240
my key recommendation to vendors is to

739
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,799
stay in touch with researchers

740
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,960
because you're risking way too much you

741
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,679
know

742
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,320
if it's a really major vulnerability

743
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
well probably you won't lose your

744
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,079
license to operate but there will be

745
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,839
fines and there will be reputational

746
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,839
damage

747
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,000
it's a good idea if you're a vendor to

748
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,918
develop a vulnerability vulnerability

749
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,079
disclosure policy so that's uh

750
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,000
researchers find it easier to get in

751
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,639
touch with you

752
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,119
in fact you know if they've read it it

753
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,280
will be easier for them to submit their

754
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
report in the format

755
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,639
that is most convenient to you

756
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,639
then i've mentioned the ideas as well

757
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,359
please remember about your users

758
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,239
even if you can not you know remove the

759
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,240
vulnerability you can at least propose

760
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,680
some compensatory measures

761
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,800
of vulnerabilities please please please

762
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,040
report responsibly

763
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,520
and full disclosure in most cases should

764
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,720
be avoided

765
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,440
be responsible about your disclosures

766
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,119
at the same time situation now is very

767
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,720
weird

768
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
please note that some of your

769
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,880
disclosures may actually mean additional

770
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,720
risks to russian corporations

771
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,880
again you know it's up to you it's your

772
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
judgment call please be responsible

773
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,000
about the decisions you make thank you

774
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,160
very much

775
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,920
yeah like the technical center for the

776
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,760
critical information infrastructure gas

777
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,880
opcamp

778
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,119
to inform about the vulnerabilities

779
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,800
and my second question you know

780
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,680
sometimes vendors

781
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,200
offer responses which are

782
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,960
never here you know there they may be

783
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,400
technical but

784
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
infeasible or they may be documentary

785
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
only

786
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
in other words

787
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
the vendor reacts

788
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,520
in a pretty useless manner

789
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,960
so how do we go about it do we inform

790
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,200
socs do we publish our own compensatory

791
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,919
measure proposals

792
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,919
thank you for the question

793
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,800
well if you inform fstc this is never a

794
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
mistake this way

795
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
you are assured your bdu no

796
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
if you are actually informing them

797
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,640
through ntcc

798
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,880
this is another option

799
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,240
but i actually think that working

800
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,800
directly with fstc that's just more

801
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
convenient

802
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,560
if you google for it you will find a

803
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,040
pretty pretty easy step-by-step guide

804
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
about half a page long

805
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,400
you don't need to submit your pocs

806
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,760
you know actually i was surprised you

807
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
know they're very nice people to deal

808
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
with

809
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,640
organization

810
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,279
second question

811
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,680
expertise-based systems that should also

812
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,359
help so you can have this um you know

813
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
combo of different tools

814
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
that should to help you defend against

815
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,320
the vulnerability that has not been

816
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,560
patched

817
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,960
thank you

818
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,880
when the vendor has recognized that the

819
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
vulnerability exists

820
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,520
so when you send a request for cvid

821
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
usually provides a reference to

822
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
the vendor's response and mitra will

823
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
then give you an id very quickly because

824
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,640
they see the vendor has a recognized

825
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,480
vulnerability

826
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,359
now with bdu

827
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,760
that fstc will then tell us you know how

828
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,160
we should act

829
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,960
will they try

830
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,480
running the show or not and my second

831
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
question is about open source

832
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,839
vulnerability

833
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
fstc

834
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,280
you would want to inform them at the

835
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,760
same time

836
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,720
you don't have to do the same seconds

837
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,040
but doing it you know the same day

838
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,599
is a sensible idea

839
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,480
it's okay for fstc

840
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
to get your message

841
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,160
saying that you know we have informed

842
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,280
the vendor

843
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,040
and we just want you to know there is an

844
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
issue there nfstc will tell you thank

845
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,760
you very much for notifying us what is

846
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,359
your recommendation regarding protection

847
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,599
so you get in touch with fstc you say

848
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,200
well there is this open source product

849
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
and i've identified this vulnerability

850
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,000
i've not been able to get in touch with

851
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,079
the maintainers or the founders can you

852
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,839
please help me

853
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,079
or you know i've informed them they

854
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,000
promise to fix it they say it will take

855
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
him a month or two the response will be

856
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,599
yes thank you very much

857
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,280
it's important for them to know that it

858
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,240
exists

859
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,119
and they will create an id for it

860
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,599
and just like with cves the id will be

861
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,680
publicized only after the fix is

862
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,078
released

863
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,400
under the current conditions

864
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,640
does it happen that you know we have uh

865
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,240
identified say a vulnerability with

866
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,079
cisco and they don't want to talk to us

867
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,720
and we talk to fstc and then you know

868
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
some serious looking gentleman will be

869
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,160
asking us about the details of the

870
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,160
vulnerability

871
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
is discovered in cisco products

872
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
i believe they will be happy to talk to

873
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,078
you because they want to address it

874
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,480
however what i predict may happen is

875
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
that when they publish a patch they will

876
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,160
not make it available to their russian

877
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,200
customers

878
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,240
please keep that in mind

879
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,480
i'm sorry i know very little about the

880
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,079
way that law enforcement agencies

881
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,319
operate

882
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,520
i believe that if you inform fstc and

883
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
they publish some compensatory measures

884
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,200
well this is certainly good

885
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
will they inform other law enforcement

886
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,799
agencies that i don't know

887
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,720
hello thank you very much for reports

888
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,319
i'm sorry let me

889
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,400
very quickly build on what i said

890
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,960
when you inform fstc you do not

891
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,119
contribute any exploits right you just

892
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,950
give them the description that's it

893
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,599
[Music]

894
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,960
on the previous question there are some

895
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,720
russian vendors

896
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,560
which are using runtime frameworks

897
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,359
international ones

898
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,640
when we report to russian companies

899
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,520
they will say you know what

900
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,640
this particular international inventor

901
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,520
would love to fix this issue for us but

902
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,240
they cannot

903
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
because uh you know russia is in this

904
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,720
particular position that it is

905
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,079
so we will get in touch with f stack

906
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,760
tell them that this vulnerability has

907
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,160
been found

908
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,880
and this effectively means

909
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,680
that you know we may err

910
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,480
on the side of not reporting to the

911
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,960
vendors

912
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,640
if it's an open source solution

913
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
i don't see why you wouldn't report it

914
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,480
because say with open source software

915
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,880
you can always do code review

916
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,319
there are two key risks when you do

917
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,440
reporting

918
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,240
one is how you do not get the updates

919
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,280
particularly if the vendor has

920
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,560
officially announced they are living

921
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,880
russia if the vendor has not made an

922
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,319
official announcement like this there is

923
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,599
a different risk

924
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,240
that you know

925
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,440
that you know

926
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,680
the stuff you get as updates will be

927
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,920
more than update that you know it will

928
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,880
break your system or will bring it back

929
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,040
door or something

930
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,000
so i don't really have a recommendation

931
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,720
for that individual cases need to be you

932
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,400
know considering their own base on their

933
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,839
own merits

934
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,400
two questions

935
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,680
what do i do if i see that the vendor is

936
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,440
dragging their feet

937
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,200
how do i motivate the vendor to stop

938
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,040
doing it

939
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,800
the second one

940
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,040
sort of uh continues in the same vein as

941
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,880
the previous ones

942
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,400
actually some vendors are available

943
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,119
through hackerone

944
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,200
it's easier because they publish their

945
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,240
policies

946
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
but some vendors don't do bug bounty

947
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,319
programs

948
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,520
and

949
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,119
we can all you know remember cases of uh

950
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,160
like nintendo

951
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,599
stalking or even uh persecuting

952
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,000
researchers

953
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,720
i think that only zdi

954
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,599
has uh you know tried to going after his

955
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,079
treasuries

956
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,599
what are these legal risks like before

957
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,200
like how do i

958
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,920
assess those risks

959
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,240
before i get in touch with the avenger

960
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,480
like uh you know with nintendo the the

961
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,240
risk would be that you know i see a

962
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,119
black maria in front of my house next

963
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,440
day after i report a vulnerability to

964
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,839
them

965
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,200
let me think about your question

966
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,040
all right fender dragging their feet

967
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,920
right

968
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,640
i nearly forgot it

969
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,760
my answer to your question

970
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
is in this slide

971
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,000
what is

972
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,880
if you find this uh vulnerability

973
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,800
disclosure policy on the wendy vendor's

974
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,880
website and they said we do believe in

975
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,000
cardinal disclosure

976
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,640
can you report this vulnerability to

977
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,520
them

978
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,440
you sort of undertake to play by the

979
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,440
rules

980
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,359
disclosure it's the company calling the

981
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,359
shots with a responsible disclosure you

982
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,200
say well you know i want to you know i

983
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,160
want to disclose it

984
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,720
i am prepared to help you a bit but i

985
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,640
will be calling the shots

986
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,640
and you know smaller companies are often

987
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,440
immature enough so the way it works is

988
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,839
how do you tell well i give you time

989
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,400
to address this vulnerability i give you

990
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
90 days

991
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,599
if you have failed to address it within

992
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,000
90 days

993
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,640
should be some exceptions to this rule

994
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,799
but

995
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,720
would you like them to be engaged as

996
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,480
well

997
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,160
yeah by the way we've already sent them

998
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,399
a letter

999
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,800
so please be aware

1000
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,000
that we know you're dragging yourself

1001
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,040
and your cert knows that

1002
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,200
and we can easily you know forward our

1003
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,640
email communications to them

1004
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,440
they're also human beings right they've

1005
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,960
got their own interests they've got

1006
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
their aims

1007
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,559
you know we often think of corporations

1008
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,440
as

1009
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,400
you know

1010
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,280
soulless machines but the reality is

1011
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,359
that they're stuffed by people

1012
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,680
and you know they often want to protect

1013
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,680
their asses they don't want to be

1014
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,920
flocked or fired for doing shitty codes

1015
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,000
so you may want to explain to them that

1016
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,559
this is not bad news

1017
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,640
you know we've just told you how you can

1018
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,200
upgrade your system to the next level

1019
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,400
where it will be

1020
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,880
you know less

1021
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,839
well if you don't want to see a black

1022
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,480
maria in front of your home

1023
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,440
well i inform them through platforms

1024
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,839
where you can do it

1025
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,000
anonymously or you can do it through the

1026
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,920
existing regulators such as russian

1027
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,200
regulator

1028
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,319
and if the vendor is okay

1029
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,359
you know you can send them the report

1030
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,880
and you don't have to do it through the

1031
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,839
regulatory

1032
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,160
so here the regulator will effectively

1033
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,440
be in midi

1034
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,400
now i see him a good vendor has fixed

1035
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,480
everything

1036
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,680
and i want to publish an article

1037
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,680
can i tell them i want to publish this

1038
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,040
article and the veteran says no you

1039
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
don't

1040
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,480
we are not okay with that what do i do

1041
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,800
and this

1042
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,720
i'm sorry i'm certainly not so well

1043
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,319
positioned to take this part of the

1044
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,920
question but you should talk to the

1045
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,800
organizers for sure

1046
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,480
we have like six more minutes

1047
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,520
i'm wondering if there is any difference

1048
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,880
in terms of dealing with the vendor

1049
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,480
directly or through a particular

1050
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,359
platform and what would be more

1051
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,440
efficient

1052
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,200
in terms of reporting i mean

1053
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,200
experts

1054
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,559
and it's therefore pretty easy to

1055
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,000
predict what's going to happen for the

1056
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,839
vendors as well as the researchers

1057
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,040
now if you're using a bug bouncy

1058
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,520
platform

1059
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,359
you should be able to retain you know

1060
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,280
more researchers so that you know they

1061
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,040
look more into their products and make

1062
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
them even

1063
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,799
more secure

1064
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,000
today if avenger is not present at a bug

1065
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,839
bounty platform

1066
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,440
which may be due to different reasons

1067
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,880
it means that all the risks

1068
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,240
are related to research and

1069
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,839
communications rest with them

1070
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,480
a researcher may be unhappy

1071
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,240
it's all about human to human

1072
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,240
communication

1073
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,000
i know some people they get

1074
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,559
insulted by a meme

1075
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,240
or a smiley in official communications

1076
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,920
sometimes you know the chemistry simply

1077
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,960
doesn't work

1078
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,160
and the end result is that a

1079
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,520
vulnerability doesn't get patched

1080
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,760
i cannot tell you if it's good or not

1081
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,599
what i'm trying to say is that

1082
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,760
approaches may differ much really

1083
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,720
depends

1084
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,359
on the maturity of a given vendor

1085
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,599
and the extent to which

1086
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,200
the vendor will want to attract

1087
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,319
attention to their products

1088
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,440
now if they want to be

1089
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,800
you know

1090
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,480
seen dramatically different from the

1091
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
rest of the industry

1092
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,640
they will probably want to be present at

1093
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,920
a bug bounty platform

1094
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,760
all right the chinese vendors tend to

1095
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,520
demand as many

1096
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,400
more pocs than anybody else

1097
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,559
it is partially a language issue you

1098
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,800
know screenshots

1099
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,680
somehow don't work that much for them

1100
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,558
they love videos

1101
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,280
you know their english language skills

1102
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,359
sometimes are not good enough for you

1103
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,440
know just written communications they do

1104
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,880
prefer videos

1105
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,520
let's wrap it up okay

1106
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,800
disclosure

1107
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,559
they are effectively card in nature

1108
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,040
it's effectively a mixture of bug bounty

1109
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,440
and coordinated disclosure

1110
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,800
i won't go into excruciating detail

1111
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,359
but please note it's also a way of

1112
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,599
responsible disclosure thank you very

1113
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,000
much thanks for interest

1114
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,839
the last slide contained my content

1115
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,079
details if you're interested please ask

1116
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,119
me questions on telegram or contact me

1117
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,920
