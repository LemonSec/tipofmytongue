1
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,039
he is the head and developer of the

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
business

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
center develops business center of

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,279
fighting against cyber attacks response

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,800
center against cyber attacks i don't

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,359
really understand what you do

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,240
i always thought that you the head of

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
the jsoc

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,040
the drukov is the head of the jsoc so

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,719
you're the second guy

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,480
well let's see situation is much more

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
complicated

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
previously in solar has been working as

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
analytic and pre-sale

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
then i've collected the department and

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
at a certain moment of time

17
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,199
volva has offered me a topic related

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,239
with the business development and

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,719
this area is being headed by me but of

20
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
course pre-sale

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,559
i couldn't live

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,199
here especially in such difficult days

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,679
like today

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,360
well right now we're going to speak

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
about those days

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
and if you are in a borderline between

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
technical

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
diving and these business vessels

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,200
then let's speak about what has changed

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
in informational security in the market

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,520
what has changed in recent six months

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
and how do you feel yourself what do you

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
feel in the market

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,079
okay

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
let's begin by saying that from the

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
point of view of informational security

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
there are changes which are noticeable

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
by everybody the growth of the number of

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,920
dose attacks

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
violations of different sites uh other

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,439
things

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,759
there are less noticeable things which

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,119
to my point of view will show themselves

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,560
more and more

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,360
and this is activity of advanced

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
criminals whose main objective is not to

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,640
break something very quickly and to

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,799
announce about their position but to

49
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,719
penetrate into the infrastructure of the

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
company

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
stay there for a certain period of time

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
and after this

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
do

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
big damage

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,120
today we don't see that for a certain

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,879
company from the real sector of economy

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,959
in the industry or the energy they are

58
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,640
non-acceptable risks but i wouldn't

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
avoid and i wouldn't disclose this

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,480
vector of attacks so you're saying that

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
serious guys will be targeting to stop

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,120
or to seriously influence organizations

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,879
of industry

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,760
fuel

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,518
energy etc etc yes

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,959
i think that after a certain period of

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,720
time all these mass ddos attacks will

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
come to nothing they will get tired of

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
it

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,160
and things which are happening

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,959
constantly within a long period of time

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,879
it's not

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,200
interesting to people

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,239
that's why yes i think this mass trend

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
of ddos will

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,239
uh disappear

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,080
it will still stand high position coming

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,319
to the previous year but targeted

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
attacks with a serious stoppage of

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,400
business processes and god forbid

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,319
technological processes this is

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,400
something that we can expect in the

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
nearest future near future when when

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
when we should

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,040
faint

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
well according to our experience and

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
according to the experience of your

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,080
company as well

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
is not developing within a week it takes

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,519
months

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
so i think right now we can speak about

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,680
months so the first signs might appear

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
in the beginning of the summer

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
maybe in the middle of the summer

95
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
something will

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
show up a little bit later

97
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
so i think that in the summer we have

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
the independence day so we will have

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
some gifts during that well speaking

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,720
about connection to certain dates on one

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
side it would be very logical

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,400
many people were expecting

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
this

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
mass things by 9th of may but

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
a lot of public things that we know

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,760
roots you have suffered also i have seen

107
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,199
and by the way

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
yes it was a story within cyrus it's

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
something else i wanted to remember the

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
case with lenta.u which on 9th of may

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
had other headers but it was not

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
insiders well according to the official

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
position these were actions of insiders

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,759
uh so this is something else

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,680
i wouldn't get connected to certain

116
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
dates but i think that us soon

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,080
as uh

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
criminals will find something they will

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
realize that they will do it and

120
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,960
for example today

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,320
database of leakages were updated for

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
yandex food yes we've been speaking

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
about yandex food today

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
and i want to google and see what's

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
happening with this database what's

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
happening what's happening about me

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,639
there's information there's a passport

128
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
data

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
registrations and everything else did

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,520
you look at it have you seen all the

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
names not of course of course not

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,520
today i'm here with you the whole day

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
that's why it's doubtful that criminals

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,360
will dedicate it to phds

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
i think these are just uh adjacent dates

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,119
yeah by accident

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
we've been speaking a lot about import

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,919
substitution

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,199
by the end of the day i'm losing my

140
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,520
words and we've been speaking about uh

141
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
the part of vendors who previously have

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
been closing big pieces of informational

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
security and they stopped doing that

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
well i would like to ask you how you as

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
a supply of services how do you live in

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
the conditions of import substitution

147
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
when you form

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,039
the same jsoc you have the full set of

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,199
different tools so what do you do with

150
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
them well according to our mass services

151
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,680
like mss and jsoc we did have components

152
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,840
related to foreign vendors in different

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,039
industries for example we had suppliers

154
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,639
of feeds uh compromising indicators from

155
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
the western companies which

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
as it is well known as the first

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
community they just stopped updating

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
they stopped sending us updates we

159
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,639
in the condition of mss we had computy

160
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
anti-spam solutions from western vendors

161
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
and it's understandable as soon as the

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
special operation has started we have

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
understood that earlier later this might

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
happen that's why we did have a certain

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,440
plan because always

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
the choice was

167
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,440
done from the position that there should

168
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
be a domestic solution and there should

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
be a good and mature solution so in some

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
directions we have only domestic

171
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
solutions because they are really mature

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,638
and like application firewalls

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
in

174
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
the brand models uh input substitution

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
should happen but of course it was

176
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
understandable we did have some clients

177
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,400
that worked on western solutions of

178
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
those brand models so we've been putting

179
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
them in a certain queue well of course

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
we've tried to minimize downtime when we

181
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
did it in the planned order but

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
everybody started running in this

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,199
direction because the time was going

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
away and we had a lot of clients

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
speaking about socks situation is very

186
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
simple and it's not only for us but for

187
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
the whole community of mssp providers

188
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,720
many

189
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
of them in the basis of their services

190
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
had

191
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,759
western cms but we had two vendors you

192
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
had double-headed double-headed dragon

193
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,360
two twin brothers sitting inside

194
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,199
yeah that's what was happening

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,000
and that's why all the clients

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
what is the main advantage of cm cms

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
have not been discontinued uh

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
simultaneously that's why it's

199
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
understandable some have been

200
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
discontinuing the activities it's not

201
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,680
like we are getting leaving russia and

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,039
we're disconnecting you know these were

203
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,080
official letters uh like we are stopping

204
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,919
our activity we cannot provide technical

205
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
support to you but no worried about the

206
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,800
product

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
therefore

208
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
continuation of contracts is the painful

209
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,560
stage so when we deny an old contract

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
well this question can be equalized uh

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
so that not everybody will migrate to

212
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
local solutions but after the migration

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
of the clients we had to legitimize our

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
activity

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,680
by using another cm some have been

216
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,879
transferred to cm

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,199
that was a domestic one

218
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,919
some clients came to us with a request

219
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
that there is another domestic cm which

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
they want to switch to

221
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,839
and therefore this technological

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,159
possibility was also developed with

223
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
another large supplier so you will have

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,039
it

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,600
basically yes

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,440
mssp providers should

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,720
be

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
the only partner there always should be

229
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,160
a choice because there are different

230
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
situations i understand you

231
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,200
can you tell me please about business

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
about business part

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
how do clients live in condition of

234
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
import substitution well except for the

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,920
fact whether they offer you another cm

236
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,480
well clients they all live differently

237
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,080
and honestly speaking i would like to

238
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,399
tell you that out of our clients working

239
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
with the sock

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,160
there were no serious

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
hacks of the infrastructure yes of

242
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,040
course we did have some phishing

243
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
necklace some people were attacked

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
through the web scanning some being

245
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
attached to ddos attacks they did those

246
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
their services but they had another

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
telecom operator and we could not

248
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
provide them protection from ddos

249
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,560
attacks

250
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
but speaking about big

251
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
hugs and leakages nothing like that

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
happened from the point of view of new

253
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
clients and their arrival to us right

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,279
now we

255
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
are observing the situation when people

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
at the last moment of time they are

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
searching for solutions some people are

258
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,640
waiting

259
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
in hope that

260
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
the explosion is not going to happen

261
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
over their head so

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
some already have suffered

263
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
some people are expecting some are

264
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
trying to find fast solutions and of

265
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
course service related solutions are

266
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
really fast the stage of connection like

267
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
five to ten days and right now we have

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
reduced these uh especially for warmth

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
and auntie d doors because people need

270
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
it they need it immediately they are

271
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,920
under attack so sometimes it takes 24

272
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
hours and maybe even less when people

273
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,279
really need it

274
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
there was there were a lot of attempts

275
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,320
to make provocations during may 9th

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
related with certain drinks

277
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
by attacking a system which wouldn't

278
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
allow yeah this case was mentioned today

279
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
so we had to protect it so that whole

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,399
country would have a good may ninth

281
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,360
holiday good job good job

282
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
listen okay let's speak about cases if

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
you started speaking about that can you

284
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279

your opinion

286
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,560
top three

287
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,440
most impressing events

288
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
in recent six months

289
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
in the area of i.t security well that's

290
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
understandable that's understandable

291
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
my final vacation have impressed me

292
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,920
sincerely good positive yeah let's speak

293
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
about work

294
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
don't make me jealous

295
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
no i was able to rest before this

296
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,519
happened

297
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,040
well i believe that

298
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
there was an interesting attack against

299
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
ross monitor related with dfa's side

300
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
because

301
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,880
it was a proper

302
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
strategically proper vector

303
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
to make

304
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
bring people to panic the second

305
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
announcement of the anonymous company

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
from the point of view of the cyber

307
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,360
attack

308
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,959
what do you think was it a serious

309
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,240
announcement uh these apt serious apts

310
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,460
or

311
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,920
[Music]

312
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
why not

313
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
well these are people who are playing

314
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
i will take everything and let everybody

315
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
know about me

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,639
i think that it can be both ways but i

317
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,920
still think why not why not i think yes

318
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
and topic number three is

319
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
out of those events which have

320
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
astonished me it's readiness of the

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
domestic vendors to help everybody both

322
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
clients directly and

323
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839
mssp partners

324
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,560
a bright example is when the company

325
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
while contracting the process and it

326
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,920
takes a certain period of time and

327
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
therefore we have to look at this in a

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,519
moment we need licenses we need

329
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,800
something else so we need some

330
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,079
consulting

331
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,320
uh purchase updates if something is not

332
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
working because the client is very

333
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
specific for some very specific website

334
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
and vendor

335
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,920
should reply to this very fast they

336
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,240
should go for the dialogue vendors who

337
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
represent developing cm systems

338
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
in the roles of catching up also

339
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
actively ready to go for the dialogue so

340
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,920
everybody understand the situation on

341
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
the active market instead of behaving as

342
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,120
kings okay please come to us we're going

343
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
