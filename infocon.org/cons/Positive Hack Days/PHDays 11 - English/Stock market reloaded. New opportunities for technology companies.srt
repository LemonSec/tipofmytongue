1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
this time

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,759
on these positive hack days we wanted to

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,600
add

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,840
the section about investment stock

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
market and the reason is quite clear

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,759
last time positive wasn't the public

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,760
company

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
but in december last year we had an ipo

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,039
in the moscow stock exchange it's now a

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
continuous topic for us investments

veterans of the stock market analysts

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
so we have a good panel today let me

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
begin with the first subject

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
which

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,479
is a little confrontational

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
ipo

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
it so happened that positive

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,240
technologies was the last russian

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
companies to do the ipo to become a

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,400
public company it happened in december

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,280
2021 since then

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
for almost six months

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,240
we didn't have any more ipos the

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,320
question to the panel is what is

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,798
happening

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,200
uh does it mean that ipos have entered

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
in russia or are there some other

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,320
factors which delay ipos now the

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
question is to anton

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
what do you think

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
thank you maxime

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
well

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
honestly the world

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
is divided

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
into two periods before february 24 and

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
after

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,720
february 24.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,200
the greater part of the russian free

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,520
float is in the hands of the foreign

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,959
investors

51
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,920
the share of

52
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,440
retail

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,120
investors is growing we had a lot of

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
foreigners and still have them

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
so the market was driven by foreign

56
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
investors

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
this factor

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
because of the events that you know

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
has come to an end but on the other hand

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,760
the russian market

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
doesn't stand still

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
it has been coming for a long

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,040
time a little before your event

64
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
the saint petersburg

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
stock exchange became public we couldn't

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
imagine it three years ago or ten years

67
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
ago

68
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
we didn't imagine that

69
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,840
oh

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,440
we can have a deal for 175

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,239
million dollars

72
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
through retail

73
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
it was difficult to imagine but now

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
russian market

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
is retail driven

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,599
the trade in the moscow

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
stock exchange

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
are provided by retail investors

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,560
and obviously

80
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,439
this is

81
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
a good

82
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,239
foundation basis for

83
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,910
the deals like sbb

84
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,439
[Music]

85
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,280
stock exchange it's difficult to

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
er imagine when it can happen

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,200
but

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
it will happen one day i'm

89
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,680
absolutely sure it's a matter of time

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,918
now vladimir the question is to you

91
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,800
you are more related to

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,320
institutional investors and funds

93
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,639
what do you think

94
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,160
is the

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
lack of institutional investors the main

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,720
factor is the retail king now

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
i believe

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
we don't have ipos not because of the

99
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
lack of ipo

100
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
institutional investors

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
so we all try to find where

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
the

103
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
balance is not only in russia but

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,320
worldwide i believe in the second or

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
third quarter uh it will be clear where

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
the balance is

107
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,440
which companies are better which are

108
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
worse

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
we didn't have a lot of institutional

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,039
investors locally we had western funds

111
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,120
mainly but those western funds were

112
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,479
filled by

113
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,039
russian capitals

114
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,919
which returned to russia through the

115
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,320
western funds now

116
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,840
this flow is much limited

117
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
we need a few quarters

118
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
for the russian capital

119
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,880
to flow into the local

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,759
institutional investors and come back to

121
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
the stock market

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
will it happen will it be more than

123
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,720
before less than before it's too early

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
to say we can expect that we shall have

125
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,560
even more capital than before

126
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
because the uh capital that fled from

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
russia didn't only come back to russia

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,919
it also

129
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,560
spread across the international stock

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
markets and now that the russian money

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,639
doesn't go away

132
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,520
it

133
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,240
we

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
may expect

135
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
bigger volumes than before

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
but now the landscape is unclear

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
uh any evaluation of the company is an

138
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,479
evaluation of the future now it's very

139
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
difficult to evaluate the future because

140
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
the situation changes every day and

141
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,720
every hour and people are cautious now

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
evgeny

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,240
the only thing to add

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,759
is that much depends on the paradigm of

145
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,240
our general development of the country

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
and economy and where to take resources

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
for development i think

148
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
common sense will prevail and we shall

149
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
understand that without market economy

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
we cannot do

151
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
and stock market is the only

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
tool

153
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
to attract finances for development

154
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,759
of economy of business and so on also

155
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,720
i'm

156
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,759
looking at alternatives we have a lot of

157
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,400
people with the money with

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
a lot of money

159
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,319
they are concentrated at one or two

160
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
percent of population but it's a

161
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,280
different thing and nevertheless we have

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,919
a lot of money in the camp in the

163
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
country a lot of corporations

164
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
who have a lot of liquidity

165
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,319
and they have to sell

166
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,280
dollars and euro get rubles and where to

167
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,160
send the rubles the company do

168
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
mna

169
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
we see that they buy and buy

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
new

171
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,000
home credit bank and we are at the

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,039
beginning of the process what is next

173
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,479
those corporations will go to the market

174
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,120
and people from those company come to me

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,400
and say

176
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,199
this is the market what to buy

177
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
a lot of questions

178
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,039
and one more important point

179
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,319
the financial market is all about

180
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
transparency about reporting about

181
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
understanding of the company and its

182
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,080
future if you analyze you have to

183
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,279
analyze and not just guess

184
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,039
if some

185
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,479
companies

186
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
remain in non-transparent

187
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
the investor will look at transparent

188
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
companies only and if people are clever

189
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
and say that we are transparent

190
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
everything is clear we have a lot of

191
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
money that company is doomed to success

192
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,240
as for our local closed sandbox

193
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
russian stock market it's a local small

194
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,120
sandbox i don't know who is going to

195
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
sell

196
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
who will go from their gdrs what is next

197
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,160
where to spend the money and they they

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
are looking for interesting stories

199
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
every day

200
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,120
despite international collisions and

201
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
the world will be very hot in the near

202
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
future our market can demonstrate fine

203
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
phenomenal growth because there are

204
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
there is no alternative

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
it's an interesting subject but if we

206
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
look at a different

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
area

208
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,959
investors funds

209
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,640
what about companies that would like to

210
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
go to the

211
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
stock market

212
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,040
are there such companies alina did you

213
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,839
talk to such companies the companies who

214
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,399
would like to do the ipo

215
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,680
do such companies come to you

216
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
saying we want to be public

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,959
right now

218
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
honestly

219
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
everyone put

220
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,640
those

221
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
strategies on hold yes the sandbox is

222
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,200
small

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
but we look at the global situation as

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
well the global ipo market

225
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,079
in q1 is minus

226
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,160
72 percent

227
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,880
it's not about russia it's about

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
us

229
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,720
a lot of companies delay their ipos

230
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,040
because of the pandemics because of the

231
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,399
inflation

232
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,720
because of the

233
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
um helicopter money which were

234
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
invested in retail

235
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
uh then

236
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
february 24 as well

237
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,040
so it's too early to discuss

238
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
now

239
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
who is ready

240
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,440
who is not

241
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,640
shocked

242
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
who is ready for the ipo

243
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
the process of ipo preparation doesn't

244
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
take a month or two it takes much longer

245
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
it requires the change of the company

246
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,680
dna

247
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,240
one thing is when you are private the

248
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
other thing when you are

249
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
public

250
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
and the process of dna change takes a

251
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
lot of time

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
a lot of processes a lot of structural

253
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,880
changes

254
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
a lot of changes and corporate

255
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,680
management transparency which evgeny

256
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
mentioned

257
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,079
and the question of market is secondary

258
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,040
now as soon as the

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
windows of opportunity

260
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,240
will be open

261
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
when we

262
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,079
realize where we're all moving

263
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,959
we are moving and the market is moving

264
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,399
uh the latest statistics says that

265
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
everyone went to cash

266
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
and everyone sits with cash and

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
weight

268
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,680
to see what is going to happen and where

269
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
to deploy such cash

270
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,079
so before we realize that

271
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,000
it's difficult to say

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,800
on the one hand we have a lot of money

273
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
the money which is looking for

274
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,680
investments

275
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
they are in the cash format on the other

276
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,200
hand the companies

277
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
cannot do the ipo because they don't

278
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
have reliability transparency and

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
stability

280
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,600
to invest

281
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
so this is a disbalance a lot of money

282
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
but no one is going to

283
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,000
invest

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
is that right

285
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,399
i would put it this way exactly because

286
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,560
now really

287
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,760
taken taking into account the

288
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,000
instability and

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
um

290
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,279
you can see what happens with the

291
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
u.s stock markets

292
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
tech stocks

293
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
so the expectation of communities not to

294
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,279
grow but to save

295
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,680
power industry banking

296
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
is

297
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,839
something that the investors could

298
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
invest

299
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,560
but all trends are temporary whenever

300
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
something is going to change

301
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,760
we can

302
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,120
see a lot of

303
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
transformation

304
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,399
look how fast we overcame

305
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,639
the pandemic

306
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
a year or two

307
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,800
the companies that were ready and use

308
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
the opportunity the windows or

309
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
opportunity

310
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
they can be

311
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
applauded okay special

312
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,839
i heard a lot of things recently about

313
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,040
how to

314
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,839
evaluate the company

315
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,160
the approaches and methodologies through

316
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,680
multipliers through dcfs and other

317
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,720
interesting terms no longer work

318
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,279
and the question is to dmitry who is a

319
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,560
professional analyst is that right

320
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,720
are we now in

321
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
in the area of uncertainty how to

322
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
evaluate the company how to invest or

323
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,519
not to invest i think that standard

324
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,320
methodologies didn't go there are

325
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
different modes of operation in the

326
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,800
market people look only at local

327
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,199
conditions like the russian market they

328
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,560
look at the

329
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,680
global situation internationally

330
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,399
worldwide we see much

331
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
fewer ipos than before

332
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,720
and liquidity goes out of the market why

333
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
why ipos grew

334
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
because

335
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,839
money was

336
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,040
printed we had too much money and it was

337
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,320
very good to do ipo because the money

338
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
was there and the company collected

339
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,320
that money and the companies were ready

340
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,880
to pay to get a lot of money

341
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,600
so this bubble

342
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,079
no longer exists

343
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
but what about russia

344
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,880
of course one of the methods

345
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,240
was is broken the dividend method most

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
of the companies refuse to pay the

347
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
dividends because of the uncertainty

348
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
they are not

349
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,519
sure what is going to happen in future

350
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
although they don't know where to spend

351
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
the money

352
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
import has

353
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
shrunk

354
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,120
at the growth

355
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
mode we cannot say that in a month's

356
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,199
time the company will cost

357
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,199
that much so

358
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,560
two to three years what we need for

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,759
fundamental non-technical investment to

360
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,880
realize what is the addressable market

361
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
what the company can do who are the

362
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
competitors

363
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,519
how they

364
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,560
correlate in terms of products and on

365
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,519
that basis we can evaluate what kind of

366
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
money a capital flow

367
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
it may have can it

368
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,920
earn the money or will it work at a loss

369
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,800
it's a long-term story you can never

370
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,680
expect fast results from the market so

371
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
the only method which is broken is a

372
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,120
method of evaluation by dividends

373
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,360
so many of us are long-term investments

374
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
for many

375
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
russian

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,320
to say nothing of foreign companies

377
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,039
but that is off topic

378
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,799
you wanted to comment yes

379
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,880
the situation is difficult

380
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
complex

381
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,839
a lot of changes have taken place

382
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
bloomberg and reuters

383
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,039
stopped offering their services in

384
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,480
russia

385
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,199
and now the market has to find

386
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,760
alternative providers

387
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
of

388
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,760
information systemic information of

389
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
course some people get

390
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
data from vpn through vpn

391
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
but we must find alternative sources

392
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
to get

393
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
to come to a consensus about foreign

394
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,760
assets

395
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,000
then transparency

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
now we have a trend

397
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,080
uh the other way around and we

398
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,880
understand why the companies do not

399
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
disclose data about themselves or they

400
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
disclose only a small part of that

401
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
information we have a story that

402
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,520
foreign banks stopped covering russian

403
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,799
companies

404
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,320
and

405
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
analytically russian analysts

406
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
see that it's more difficult to work

407
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
because they cannot make a call and get

408
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,600
all the data they need how to build the

409
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,240
consensus it's a big question next

410
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480
problem is

411
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
that the

412
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,360
trades in the moscow stock market could

413
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,000
look different if assets were sold

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
in

415
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,320
foreign stock exchanges then

416
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,919
of course

417
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,799
the in the current uncertain situations

418
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
with greater disc discount you could

419
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
still sell

420
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,039
russian internet

421
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,880
was sold at the level of foreign analogs

422
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
and other companies sold at a discount

423
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
the russian discount how to define the

424
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
russian discount now

425
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
it's a very big question

426
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
the situation is developing it's

427
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
changing the number of problems will be

428
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,559
overcome but how to evaluate it's a

429
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,120
non-trivial question and as we started

430
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
talking about ipo

431
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,480
classically

432
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
in ipo there is stage 1 after the

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,799
announcement

434
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
there is a process of

435
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,760
remarketing and now

436
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
the audience

437
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,200
that

438
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
where you can be talked where we can

439
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
talk about evaluation was reduced to

440
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
about

441
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
six

442
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
the feedback sources are not available

443
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,678
anymore and statistically

444
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
i believe that the market will find

445
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
answers to all the questions yes we'll

446
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,200
touch upon that question a little later

447
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
yes i would like to add i would like to

448
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,320
divide

449
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
the situation between short term and

450
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
longer term in the short term we shall

451
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
see who is going to survive and who is

452
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,720
not

453
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
and then

454
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
move the money from one pocket to

455
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,559
another if we look further on

456
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,720
the classical methods seem to go but

457
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
they didn't go they stay with us

458
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
because

459
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
our

460
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,600
dcfs and models and multipliers

461
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,799
will still stay

462
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,080
but in the near future i think

463
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,120
the mu shall have two methods

464
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
the first one

465
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,640
is the

466
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
method of simple alternative we have

467
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
interest rate deposits

468
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
it's gcf

469
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,559
it's the price of the money

470
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,320
we'll do it simpler and second

471
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
yes

472
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
in this situation

473
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
who is going to

474
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,400
develop who is going to scale up and who

475
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
is going to

476
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
to die

477
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
that's all

478
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,720
and wherever we see

479
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,559
the scalability

480
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,240
opportunities

481
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,600
uh getting more space because of the

482
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,440
crisis expansion we're going to invest

483
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,120
and multipliers will be dealt with later

484
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,559
i made my first money in 1998.

485
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,280
so it's the times of good opportunities

486
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,919
i wouldn't be too optimistic because

487
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,240
the people will say he is mad i'm not

488
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,760
mad we live in difficult times but you

489
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
realize that many companies

490
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,919
also

491
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
see that

492
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
the western companies

493
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,720
left

494
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
an open nisha here it's a tragedy yes it

495
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,159
is but

496
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,440
we can

497
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
seize

498
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
some of the niches because business

499
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,799
needs expansion if you don't

500
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,280
seize kaspersky will

501
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
yes of course

502
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
we are positive will not

503
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
lose the opportunities

504
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,400
now positive as an i.t company sees a

505
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
lot of support from government the

506
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,600
government supports i.t companies the

507
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,240
tax maneuver is expanding and we see

508
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,520
unprecedented benefits

509
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
support

510
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
by the government for i.t companies

511
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,840
accordingly the question is

512
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,240
do you think i t companies

513
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,240
do they need ipo at all

514
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,880
with all that kind of support you can

515
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,080
take

516
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
money in the banks and develop

517
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,799
without ipos so vladimir can you say

518
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
what do you think

519
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
well the stock markets are not only

520
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,799
money for the companies money can be

521
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,080
obtained

522
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
in different ways and sometimes cheaper

523
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,679
than in the stock market stock market is

524
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,799
transparency stability demonstration

525
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,559
of the company that it works that it's

526
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,480
not about an owner that it as such

527
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,840
occupies a certain place in the market

528
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,120
and

529
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
it's evaluated

530
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,200
a classical example of business

531
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,760
development in russia many businesses

532
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,159
are built by one person

533
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,559
one owner we have a lot of companies who

534
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,679
do not grow when the owner stops dealing

535
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
with it sometimes the company is closed

536
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
when the owner is no longer interested

537
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
in it but the task is to build in a lot

538
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,440
of independent businesses which will

539
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,240
stay in the market and grow even if the

540
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
founder goes away

541
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,279
the more companies of that kind we have

542
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,400
the more a stable economy we're going to

543
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,720
have we're too young

544
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
no we don't have many companies

545
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,279
who

546
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,559
are

547
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,840
available for stock marketing because we

548
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
need at least

549
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
uh one billion dollar of capital

550
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,600
uh for the stock exchange to be

551
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
interested and for the companies to be

552
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,760
interested in stock exchange when we

553
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,720
have more such companies we could say

554
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,679
that it market is stable because now we

555
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,880
say we have brains we have i.t companies

556
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,520
but the industry the iit industries as

557
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,240
an institution is too young

558
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
we have too few public companies we must

559
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
have dozens of them

560
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
and they support measures offered by the

561
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
government

562
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,679
are quite positive

563
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,640
free

564
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
money sometimes interest-free

565
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,120
client

566
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
access to customers

567
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
we hope

568
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,360
that

569
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,400
as a result large players will grow in

570
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
the market

571
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,760
it's important that companies

572
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,679
should

573
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,240
be able to survive because quite often

574
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
the government

575
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,600
is kind of over feeding them but

576
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,919
nevertheless we already see an example

577
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,960
such as the ministry of industry and

578
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,000
trades the way it works

579
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,400
just to

580
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,960
finish up about today's situation and

581
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
prospects for the ipo market for the

582
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,240
next few years i think russia has more

583
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,200
chances to build a large iit company

584
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,840
that can become a public company that

585
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,919
could be valued at let's say a billion

586
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,880
dollars

587
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
in the past a lot of its sub

588
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,559
sectors were occupied by western vendors

589
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,400
and it was very difficult

590
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,559
to push them out

591
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,640
and to compete with them

592
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
so everybody knows sap microsoft oracle

593
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
and the only thing that was left for

594
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,159
russian startups was to develop some

595
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,799
niche products and so to do something

596
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,520
better than sap let's say within a

597
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
niche segment but

598
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,120
if you're going to make a vertically

599
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,559
integrated solution and then you get the

600
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,159
volume the size

601
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,440
you can

602
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,799
get the value of a

603
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,919
billion

604
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,120
and now we see a lot of niches have

605
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,480
become free

606
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,600
because

607
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
of

608
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
foreign vendors

609
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,799
went away

610
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,520
the cyber security sphere is quite

611
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
interesting because there is some

612
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,440
specificity in the higher level of

613
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
regulations this story uh happened a

614
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
little bit earlier i mean the loss of

615
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,600
trust to uh western vendors because the

616
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,880
government was

617
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,000
requiring

618
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
requiring uh

619
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,240
import substitution so i think positive

620
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,240
uh happens a bit earlier

621
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,200
than companies in other

622
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
sectors

623
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,919
so i will hope for that in other 80 sub

624
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,880
sectors

625
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,240
similar large vendors will emerge not

626
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
necessarily in cyber security but in

627
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
some other areas which can become public

628
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,440
based on what you've gained

629
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,320
it says the market economy is going to

630
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,120
stay maybe within different boundaries

631
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,520
but it will be here and the investors

632
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,080
will uh come moving here

633
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,440
thank you

634
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
uh i would just like

635
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
to add a couple of words to what my

636
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,840
colleagues say today we need to look for

637
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
any traditional and non-traditional ways

638
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,360
to

639
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,919
incentivize our employees in addition to

640
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,320
what we're saying about capitalization

641
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,279
and attracting uh funding through ipo

642
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,159
and other things look today or we what

643
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,360
we have

644
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
is our brains and our people and we need

645
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
to make it so that people should stay so

646
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,960
what can we do pay them 200 000 300 000

647
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,039
400 000 any

648
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
normal professional

649
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,520
uh

650
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,480
you know

651
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
operator can give them 500 and 600 but

652
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,679
if you offer them options uh some shares

653
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,880
and make them

654
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
participants

655
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,640
co-creators that would be much more

656
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,399
interesting for them

657
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,640
so i think that today

658
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,600
the

659
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,039
uh market mechanism uh that allows an

660
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,600
employee to become part of the business

661
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
is perhaps one of the most important

662
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,880
tools that will uh make people think

663
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,799
twice whether to leave or not to leave

664
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,679
if a person has an incentive you can

665
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,960
sit in honduras but keep working on your

666
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,440
russian business so look

667
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
you've

668
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,600
added a subject that i would like

669
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,399
to address how to enter the stock market

670
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,120
stock exchange and we mentioned the

671
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,840
traditional

672
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,000
approach traditional ipos positive

673
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,640
uh went through a direct placement but

674
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
we understand that direct placements

675
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,679
worldwide is not an exclusive case i

676
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
think spotify also

677
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
went to the exchange through direct

678
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
placement how do you think in the

679
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,159
current

680
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
russian realities the stock exchange

681
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
stock market or

682
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
considering all the limitations that you

683
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,320
mentioned

684
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,679
is there

685
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,640
some

686
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,399
one traditional way

687
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,679
or direct placement do they make it

688
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,919
more attractive

689
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,480
or are they pursue different

690
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,120
goals and it makes no sense so to

691
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
compare them i'll ask alina to comment

692
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,440
and maybe dimitri anatom yes indeed the

693
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,520
subject is quite interesting

694
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,799
and in fact

695
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,600
the

696
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,799
tech segment is a driver of all

697
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,000
animations

698
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,279
that's happening in the cm market

699
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
the tech sector

700
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,679
actually

701
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,320
invented the direct placement

702
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,678
that the american exchange

703
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
approved then

704
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,039
in the beginning of 2021

705
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,399
the

706
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,919
direct placement

707
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,159
was

708
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,039
first used

709
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,840
through primary

710
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,080
investments the tech sector

711
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
was the one

712
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,159
that

713
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,240
invented hybrid auctions that we haven't

714
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
yet seen in this country in terms of uh

715
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,519
pricing

716
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
the dutch auctions

717
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,799
uh

718
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
went to prices have been fixed by

719
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,440
underwriters uh rather than uh banks

720
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,960
investors defining that price the tech

721
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,919
center

722
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,600
sector uh

723
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,559
also initiated

724
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,679
the

725
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,279
lock up

726
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,600
band

727
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,440
so

728
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
that's the

729
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,440
uh

730
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,919
so

731
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,760
therefore

732
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,279
there are a lot of

733
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,559
options

734
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,000
and the options

735
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
that unfortunately

736
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,000
have not yet been used

737
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,320
in this country

738
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,960
before this uh meeting i looked up uh

739
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
the statistic for 2021.

740
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
so the u.s last year more than a

741
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,399
thousand ipo happens and only seven

742
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,559
of them were in the direct listing

743
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,760
format so this tool even if uh it is so

744
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,039
uh

745
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,840
attractive is not used very broadly

746
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,000
even uh today it hasn't been uh

747
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,039
proven

748
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,919
that

749
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,720
using the auction uh during the book

750
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,679
building

751
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,640
phase that gives you any advantages

752
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,120
because in one case it

753
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,440
gave a positive result in other case it

754
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,279
brought the price down so there's no

755
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,679
mathematical way to prove it

756
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,880
the

757
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,360
elegance of my business and

758
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,600
my

759
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
area of expertise is that

760
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,279
there's no standard solution there's no

761
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,880
one-size-fits-all and based on your

762
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,519
experience you can always find something

763
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,679
that fits your situation

764
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,600
and when positive technologies uh was

765
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,039
going direct listing we were watching it

766
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,760
uh quite closely because you kind of

767
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,080
created new presidents

768
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
so just like lawyers will work on a

769
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,440
president basis

770
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,279
so in fact there are a lot of

771
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,559
opportunities

772
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,039
and i'm hoping that the conditions that

773
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,480
we have now

774
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,880
coming back to the government support

775
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,399
question

776
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,079
will push on a regulatory level uh the

777
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,839
market not only

778
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,440
uh to create special conditions uh like

779
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,000
achieve mortgages high salaries but

780
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,520
maybe it will become a leap that will uh

781
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,040
help us

782
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,199
develop further in terms of financial

783
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,079
tools because moscow stock exchange

784
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,159
made a colossal

785
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,399
jump in its development in terms of

786
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,839
access infrastructure

787
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,879
is second to none uh taken uh

788
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,199
they are taking the new york uh

789
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,639
frankfurt or london exchange

790
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,679
and

791
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,960
amsterdam exchange suddenly popped up

792
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,199
last year

793
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,119
there's a different story uh it's a

794
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,839
separate story why of all countries

795
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,679
so i think that in order to bring all

796
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
this stock market up

797
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,839
and come back to the market

798
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,200
uh situation

799
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,440
we need to create new tools or at least

800
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,599
to use the tools that already

801
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,200
exist worldwide

802
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,520
but within the limitations in the

803
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
current regulations are not being used

804
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,119
in this country so far

805
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,640
what do you think

806
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
spo ipo

807
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,359
ipo direct listing

808
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,000
you have to understand what an ipo is in

809
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
general because worldwide an ipo is a

810
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,880
huge event

811
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,839
is

812
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,240
a lot of people involved a lot of people

813
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,599
are being hired analysts going across

814
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,680
all the different rich

815
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,240
foundations and funds uh to appear the

816
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,640
company so it's a fully fledged pr event

817
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,359
this is the most

818
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,359
the biggest difference between

819
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,400
an ipo and direct listing

820
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,320
uh also one point is that fpo

821
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,480
is about a certain set of rules that the

822
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,680
company uh agrees to observe so you

823
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
can't go away from these rules for

824
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
instance regarding the price that you're

825
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480
going to

826
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,440
place

827
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,400
so this pr campaign is exactly

828
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
to determine that price that would fit

829
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,359
the range of estrous to

830
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,000
company management that's a big event

831
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
the rest listing is a faster approach is

832
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,240
a cheaper approach

833
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,960
but

834
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,320
is an approach that has less certainty

835
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,240
the company doesn't know whether the

836
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,040
people will start buying the shares or

837
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,359
maybe uh will have to

838
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,200
sell a herbal a share it may become

839
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,079
absolutely uninteresting to the

840
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,839
management and then they will have to do

841
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,440
something to

842
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,400
take

843
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
release the shares

844
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
actually uh

845
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,320
this is something

846
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,440
really

847
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,720
in contradiction what you're saying

848
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,079
about uncertainty

849
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:56,880
so

850
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,000
what

851
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,040
is the evaluation of base usually it's

852
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,920
based on uh the analyst research but

853
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
it's not just research it's called deal

854
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,800
research

855
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,040
but if there's no deal

856
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,880
indirect placement and direct placement

857
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
there's no deal then there's no research

858
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
and if there's no research there's no

859
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,240
valuation so what kind of a price point

860
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
a company should

861
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,400
come to an exchange stock exchange

862
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
so this is really our case and we had to

863
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,880
uh based on the opinion of analysts uh

864
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
that are not institutional but based on

865
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,160
a certain community of analysts to draw

866
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,839
up some initial price to start

867
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,560
trading from that price and i mentioned

868
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,079
this to

869
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,160
confirm your statement that direct

870
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,359
placement

871
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,480
has a lot of uncertainty about it

872
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,280
let me just add a bit it's exactly the

873
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,119
debate that is going on in the united

874
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,160
states in terms of using direct listing

875
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,320
this is basically what it's all about

876
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,200
because

877
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
in direct listing

878
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,359
you don't have

879
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,720
due diligence uh that

880
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,800
uh is usually a run

881
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,440
to define the valuation and it's kind of

882
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
broader than uh the valuation as such

883
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,960
but

884
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,359
it's the fact that during the price

885
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,440
setting and they are in the ipo there

886
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,839
are banks that also carry responsibility

887
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,480
for the disclosure of risks that uh

888
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,640
apply to the company and the industry uh

889
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,119
that investors need to pay attention to

890
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,680
in direct listing this information is

891
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,880
presented

892
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,440
in a much sparser format

893
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
so therefore indeed it's not a simple

894
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
question what's better which of the two

895
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,240
is better

896
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,040
it's clear that even in direct listing

897
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,599
if we take international practice

898
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,839
you

899
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,560
still

900
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,440
hire not an underwriter but a financial

901
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,359
consultant that helps you

902
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,800
arrive at some uh pricing even uh though

903
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,920
even though it's based on a

904
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,599
smaller selection

905
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,359
in terms of deal research but

906
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,720
nevertheless it is a justified valuation

907
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
it's not just like you come and say i

908
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
cost a hundred dollars

909
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,920
because then

910
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,720
the trade starts happening and then the

911
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
security can go down

912
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,480
yeah we've seen examples of that well

913
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,920
frankly

914
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,560
well uh happily uh we uh were able to

915
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,320
uh avoid this

916
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,480
firstly i'd like to say that it all uh

917
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
was invented by churchill in 1918 and

918
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,520
secondly if anyone remember uh the

919
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
initial phase of creating the russian

920
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,839
stock market when we were all running

921
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,079
about regions and were paying cash for

922
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,000
these shares and then brought them to

923
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
the stock exchange it was

924
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,800
the direct listing uh in its exact shape

925
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,280
uh we uh brought a lot of companies to

926
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,960
listing in the 90s in the uh notice

927
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,880
and this is the way the russian

928
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,599
uh stock markets

929
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,240
emerged i remember i came to boris chit

930
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
off and said boris you have a great

931
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,000
company abroad you saw yes

932
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,520
let's bring it to the stock market

933
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,400
others do direct listing and we did it

934
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,960
and bro he's not being listed

935
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,440
why am i mentioning it this is not there

936
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,319
is nothing new about this and in reality

937
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,640
you understand that a colleague

938
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,680
was

939
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,359
very right in saying that an ipo is a

940
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,560
very expensive uh activity i would even

941
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,319
say that it was goldman sachs so we

942
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,160
invited it to earn a lot money where i

943
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,240
was just waiting for someone to mention

944
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,119
this

945
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,920
uh greedy banks who are to blame yes

946
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,000
it's lobby what do you always say i

947
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,560
think that in the current conditions

948
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,680
i think the new version of an ipo

949
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,640
with

950
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
a narrow circle of institutional

951
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,119
investors from whom you can get feedback

952
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,800
on on

953
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
the evaluation it brings the

954
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,400
ipo closer to direct listing in fact the

955
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
difference is not that big if you have

956
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,720
50 or 100 feedback lines this

957
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,359
is a source of more or less reliable

958
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,760
information if you only have five or so

959
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,480
then uh you don't you're not getting

960
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
comparable a comparable

961
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,560
uh advantage uh compared to direct

962
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,960
listing on the one hand it's always

963
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
difficult to be the first

964
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,520
you

965
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,520
in the newest history that we have

966
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,400
were the ones uh to come first to take

967
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,359
up this challenge and you succeeded yes

968
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,560
it's clear

969
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,920
that for you

970
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
direct listing

971
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,359
is not going to stay in parity

972
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,680
uh with ipo as a tool but it's quite

973
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,359
possible that

974
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,440
the specific weight of direct listings

975
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,160
in russia will be higher at least for

976
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,920
the next couple of stages of development

977
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,240
because alina is quite right saying that

978
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,720
indeed there are very few companies in

979
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,359
the u.s direct listing is done by

980
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,240
companies that you don't need to sell to

981
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,480
banks they sell themselves quite well

982
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,599
and there's another factor in the

983
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,920
russian market direct listing in russia

984
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,119
i mean it's uh good for you to speak

985
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,480
about yourself because you have a growth

986
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,240
of 30 to 50 percent and the margin quite

987
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,040
good and you're paying out dividend but

988
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,720
there are not too many companies like

989
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,119
that in the market and it's clear that

990
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,160
the success of direct listing

991
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,040
directly depends uh on the history of

992
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,480
the company as such

993
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,119
because for a retail investor it's quite

994
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,720
possible they have an opportunity of

995
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,280
going and buying uh shares of other

996
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,880
companies at the most exchange so they

997
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,480
can go and so by american uh shares

998
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,319
saint petersburg exchange hong kong is

999
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,680
going to join

1000
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,400
so

1001
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,960
the competition has not gone away it's

1002
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,880
there and you need some luck to achieve

1003
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
success but on the whole i think the two

1004
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,079
cases are have come close okay thank you

1005
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,160
our time is running up uh six or seven

1006
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
minutes uh by the way i forgot to

1007
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,000
mention uh to those watching us online

1008
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,400
that you can ask a question if you use

1009
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,960
the qr code here in the backdrop uh you

1010
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,839
can ask a question in telegram but while

1011
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,839
we have some questions

1012
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,200
from the floor

1013
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,839
there's a microphone or

1014
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,200
that you can use to ask the question

1015
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,760
hello i say capital

1016
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,200
stanislav

1017
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,000
today it has already been mentioned

1018
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,920
about the size of the russian market and

1019
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,720
the estimate that you mentioned will be

1020
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,319
based on the size and dynamic of the

1021
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,040
russian market the second foot

1022
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,680
of positive technology

1023
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,760
it can it emerge

1024
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,680
is it possible to talk about expansion

1025
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,760
to other countries what are they have

1026
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,760
you already made any steps to

1027
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,599
expand your sales force in these

1028
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,040
countries and when can we expect the

1029
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,520
preliminary estimate at least regarding

1030
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,800
the uh targeted market size uh in these

1031
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,079
countries

1032
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,839
yes thank you

1033
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,240
we had a broadcast on radio with evgeny

1034
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,880
and we touched upon this subject yes of

1035
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,520
course positive ambitions

1036
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,319
go beyond russia and have never been

1037
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,480
confined uh

1038
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,839
by in russia the current thing is

1039
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,880
that

1040
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,640
because of

1041
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,119
the explosive growth of the russian

1042
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
cyber security market and because the

1043
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,200
foreign vendors

1044
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,400
left the market a huge market

1045
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,440
has

1046
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,760
come into the hands of the russian

1047
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,040
companies

1048
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,560
uh we

1049
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,800
are now getting 100 billion birth

1050
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,920
markets out of the 180 billion worth

1051
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,400
because the foreign vendors have left

1052
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,200
the market so our biggest priority today

1053
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,560
is just to cope with this size as we uh

1054
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,680
are kind of

1055
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,200
harvesting

1056
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,520
now how to it's a big challenge for us

1057
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
how to cope with this volume talking

1058
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,680
about the international expansion yes of

1059
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,200
course we see ourselves an international

1060
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,960
cyber security

1061
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,160
company

1062
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,119
the uh markets that we see are let's say

1063
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,760
geopolitically loyal to russia not even

1064
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,079
cis but the countries of asia the gulf

1065
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,880
uh south america strange as it may seem

1066
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,400
we already have customers from these

1067
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,520
countries

1068
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,839
we directly sell our products in all

1069
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,599
these countries

1070
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,839
and i think that in the coming two or

1071
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,200
three years

1072
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,280
these two percent

1073
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,119
that

1074
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,440
we have today i mean as a contribution

1075
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,839
of foreign sales to uh

1076
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,440
revenue will turn into double digits and

1077
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,800
i think the next

1078
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,880
year when we're going to by the end of

1079
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,240
this year when we're going to define the

1080
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680
strategy for the next two years we'll be

1081
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
able to share more details about this

1082
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,400
well maybe you have some questions uh

1083
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
not regarding positive but

1084
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,640
in general

1085
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,040
regarding the stock market

1086
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,839
can you pass the microphone over please

1087
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,359
thank you

1088
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,880
thank you

1089
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,280
another question to dmitry dimitri you

1090
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,160
said

1091
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,599
that today uh in the russian market uh

1092
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
the whole evaluation strategy uh for

1093
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,680
dividend uh in companies has broken down

1094
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,960
uh but now

1095
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,720
uh many companies in this section

1096
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,960
condition are hiding their reporting how

1097
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,480
in these conditions

1098
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
when you don't really have

1099
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,000
any information

1100
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,760
that gives information from the company

1101
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,800
as such

1102
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,839
uh how can you evaluate the company in

1103
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,280
terms of prospects or future threats

1104
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,760
thank you i think that professional

1105
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,079
analysts are now in the best position

1106
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,800
possible because these companies have

1107
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,920
taken away even historical reporting and

1108
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,760
we have it all in our models there are

1109
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,640
certain factors firstly you have access

1110
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,480
to investor relations

1111
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,880
they can

1112
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,640
contribute some information

1113
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,319
part of the information can be found in

1114
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,680
open sources

1115
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,400
so

1116
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,680
most of the russian markets

1117
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,119
are exporters

1118
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
so the dynamic of raw materials the

1119
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,640
sizes

1120
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,599
are the most important factors

1121
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,119
some analysts

1122
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:19,920
have

1123
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,240
a favorite method of looking at how

1124
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,839
similar companies are reporting let's

1125
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,839
say in the u in the u.s

1126
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,160
and thinking how does it work with

1127
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,319
russian companies it's not altogether

1128
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,480
accurate but on the whole

1129
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,079
you can arrive at some estimates of

1130
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,760
course it's not going to be an accurate

1131
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,920
estimates with complete reporting but

1132
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,800
the dynamic can always be derived and

1133
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,400
you can always

1134
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,240
use it to evaluate the company correctly

1135
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,359
question yes

1136
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,800
i have both a commentary question what i

1137
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,839
heard

1138
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,240
is that

1139
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,480
is

1140
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,200
somewhat nervous

1141
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,559
a statement

1142
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,839
that

1143
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,040
reuters and bloomberg are leaving russia

1144
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,520
being a sign of a dire

1145
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,920
time for us because now

1146
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,040
we

1147
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,000
don't

1148
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,040
have

1149
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
a capability

1150
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,480
to

1151
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,200
broadcast the opinions of the rush of

1152
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
the foreign participants

1153
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,119
in terms of evaluating russian assets

1154
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
here i would like to ask my colleagues

1155
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,559
the question

1156
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,480
how do you believe this problem could be

1157
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,680
bypassed

1158
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,800
uh because uh it exists and

1159
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,680
it looks likely that we'll have to

1160
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,359
uh deal with that

1161
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,040
for several years to come of course

1162
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,480
they'll come back

1163
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
as the song says but it won't happen

1164
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
soon and also i remember the time in

1165
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,160
1990 uh when reuters and bloomberg

1166
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,480
were fully absent from russia but

1167
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,680
nevertheless

1168
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,240
uh major investment banks like flaming

1169
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,559
at that time they emerged after that and

1170
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,200
they were not using this these

1171
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,480
aggregators they did their own homework

1172
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,280
uh to evaluate to the companies and it

1173
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,160
was this uh that was

1174
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,640
shaping the market so then a question

1175
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,160
how do you assess our own capabilities

1176
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,599
their potential

1177
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,160
so that in the time

1178
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,160
when uh the

1179
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,040
uh

1180
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,000
famous monsters of rock as i would call

1181
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,640
them uh have gone away how

1182
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,040
uh well will we will we be able uh to

1183
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,680
uh to do the evaluation

1184
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,680
maybe uh we could go away from the

1185
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,640
traditional russian discount discounts

1186
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,920
that i don't know how it

1187
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,040
has arrived in addition to the emerging

1188
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,440
markets discount because political risks

1189
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,800
have always been taken

1190
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,680
we for instance can offer discounts for

1191
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,079
our companies having a positive cash

1192
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,440
flow and a sign

1193
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,520
like a positive

1194
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,720
factor

1195
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,839
to it as opposed to

1196
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,640
the tech companies in the u.s where not

1197
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,520
everybody uh the cash flow is positive i

1198
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,640
think some knew to become a law maker

1199
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,480
in

1200
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,640
this output euro

1201
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
market now that we don't have any

1202
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,279
foreign claims

1203
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,760
let me try to

1204
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,359
start answering i mentioned reuters and

1205
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,480
bloomberg it's not a problem it's a

1206
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,680
challenge you work with the provider

1207
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,640
he sends you a letter that he is

1208
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,240
disconnecting it's not pleasant it

1209
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,760
corrects your activities for several

1210
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,119
weeks

1211
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,559
from four a month sometimes more but you

1212
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,839
will find we already found the providers

1213
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:58,640
who

1214
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,960
provide the same information not they

1215
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,200
are not western they are eastern

1216
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,599
it's not a problem it's a technical

1217
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,960
problem

1218
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,280
but we have more difficult problems

1219
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,160
that

1220
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,920
companies

1221
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,400
tend to disclose

1222
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,480
less information

1223
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,359
than how to form a consensus it's not

1224
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,559
well known

1225
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,119
but such factors will become

1226
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,760
weaker we are at the peak

1227
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,040
of information

1228
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,240
distortion so let us come to the end uh

1229
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,960
bring to the end our session

1230
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,359
so in your question

1231
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,800
you had

1232
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,720
an answer a traditional answer

1233
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,079
people

1234
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,720
say they need several months i know

1235
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,280
people who solve the problem in three

1236
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,240
days

1237
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,760
modern technologies social media three

1238
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,800
days

1239
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,000
more

1240
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,839
we have a lot of telegram channels which

1241
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,240
can provide any kind of information and

1242
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,880
finally i agree with the colleagues

1243
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,000
it's a great niche that is going to be

1244
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,480
filled very quickly

1245
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,440
lack of information well it's like lack

1246
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,200
of food

1247
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,240
and

1248
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,520
we

1249
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,480
worked

1250
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,280
in the 90s what is lack of information

1251
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
it's money

1252
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,760
well at this positive point i would like

1253
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,400
to conclude our section

1254
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,839
the fact that we are here discussing the

1255
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,880
future of the russian stock markets and

1256
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,160
the

1257
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,960
companies that may work there it means

1258
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,359
that the market existed it does exist

1259
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,240
and it will exist positive is one of the

1260
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,040
examples that where everything is going

1261
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,599
