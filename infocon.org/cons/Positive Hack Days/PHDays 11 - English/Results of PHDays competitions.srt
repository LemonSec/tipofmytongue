this cool thing about the quantity is

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
changing from year to year but it's not

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
the quantity but the quantity what is

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
the most important man this year i could

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640

this machine well we do have certain

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
zones of

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,519
attraction like payment village atms but

to this zone

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840

online bank online bank well this is uh

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,080
was the beginning of a niche

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
contest on land bank

117
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,840
on organizers

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
my colleagues have been self-organized

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,520
very well

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
they brought real atm and uh

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,639
and ander london and

124
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,750
[Music]

125
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,039
so logically it was separated like that

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
after the cast cash offices online bank

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,759
they

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
they've been partially related the atms

129
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,039
have been working together with dbo

130
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
with online banking

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,039
first and second the cash offices have

132
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,800
not been related with post terminals and

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,320
basically speaking there's also

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
some peculiarities

135
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440

one active participant with many years

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
i have a question about the age because

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
i've been looking into your countries

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,320
and i had a feeling that mostly

145
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
school kids

146
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,199
young and beautiful well

148
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
who if not school kids who are breaking

149
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
the atms and tilt offices and cash

150
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,240

154
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,280
you know young people are hacking

155
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
everything you know it's an old school

156
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
coming to us from year to year they're

158
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
breaking breaking breaking reagan and

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
these are the same people and they take

160
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
all the prices but this year because we

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,319
have extended we never had payment

162
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,479
village where scientists we had the atms

163

you know

167
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
and uh unsuspectedness was in the fact

168
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
that in the course of the first day

169
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
vigra was breaking post terminals and

170

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
us book of days and somebody has got

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,000
wires

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
and half a day we try to return it back

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
and suddenly closer to the evening

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
a lot of reports have arrived we've been

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
sitting there and we have made a

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
decision

178
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,880
[Music]

179
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
with the ass book of kusa that we will

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,479
take time out for a week

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,759
then we will look at

182
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
and then we will award winners in this

183
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
section separately and right now we have

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
officially announced winner

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,319
who was breaking post terminal because

186
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
of two days then we have three winners

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
who did this job greatly but we're going

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
to see them yes we're going to see all

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
of them

190
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
and three other winners

191
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
so seven and this is only one other

192
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
colleagues

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,280
cannot boast with this the quality is

194
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
the most important are cne you're gonna

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
be the next one

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,600
okay

197
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,669
[Music]

198
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
something that will surprise team more

199
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
in your contest in the course of two

200
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,840
days

201
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
you have the full meta universe and in

202
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
this metaverse there is a full med

203
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
exhibition

204
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
i've remembered it yes i wanted to speak

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,199
about it

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,440
that perhaps all these contests uh well

207
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,039
i had the most unusual contest it's

208
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,759
called

209
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
blockchain hunter and it's continuation

210
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
of the contest

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
that we've done last year the standoff

212
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,799
the stand of digital art stand of

213
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,080
digital art and the main idea was that

214
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
we have prepared nft we have published

215
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
them in blockchains and we put a special

216
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
in vulnerability

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
also we have got in touch with artists

218
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,760
who have provided us with our artworks

219
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,959
and this nft were digitalized artworks i

220
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
know there were kids pictures

221
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,160
previously they were not there but this

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,959
time yes we had kids artworks

223
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
which have been published in the

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
blockchain

225
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,920
so that time

226
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
the main idea of the contest was to find

227
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
vulnerabilities in smart contacts source

228
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,800
code to find these nfts this time

229
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
we

230
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
only partners to us

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,720
established partnerships with metaverse

232
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,760
application of augmented reality which

233
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,040
also has connection with blockchain

234
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
so if you

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
have application from our cone installed

236
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
on your mobile phone then on the screen

237
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
you'll be able to see some objects and

238
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
they will have a connection with

239
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
blockchain

240
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,959
so we have placed in a blockchain a new

241
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,839
nfts

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
you have to had to place your uh

243
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,839
bills

244
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,600
they would have certain value then

245
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,279
then the contest in the first iteration

246
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
we've done

247
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
the source code became vulnerable the

248
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
second objective was to find

249
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
smart contracts

250
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
in the blockchain using

251
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,320
so we had to apply our skills

252
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,880
inability of finding this big data some

253
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
good information proper information and

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
how fast your people were able to do

255
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,880
that very fast all five nfts that were

256
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
placed were discovered

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
and one participant alexey jagorov

258
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
took four nfts and by the way he took

259
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,440
one nft during the last contest

260
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
other standoff

261
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
what do you mean they took them well he

262
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
found it

263
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,519
and became an owner yeah he became an

264
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
owner so just participants have received

265
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
this nft into their property

266
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,320
and have they returned them to you

267
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
well

268
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
there was a small bug which have

269
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
prevented

270
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
transfer of this nft

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,000
i have not seen this in tests

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
i think that we will publish these

273
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,240
contracts and we could transfer the

274
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
ownership on the full scale how many

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
winners do you have two

276
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
two

277
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
i couldn't hear you can i give you

278
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,880
addition uh it's very interesting that

279
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
in the course of several years does

280
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
something related with the blockchain

281
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
three years

282
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
then we had competitive uh

283
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,519
investigation uh contest and this is

284
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
very good that because of this year we

285
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
have combined uh the hedgehog with a

286
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
snake and on thread intelligence

287
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
uh in

288
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,680
cryptocurrencies and blockchains

289
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
and this is something

290
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
that i've seen about the competitive

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
intelligence development

292
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
we should see the development of the

293
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
blockchain direction as well

294
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
we were able to push it away and then

295
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
take it and look at what else can be

296
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,720
done

297
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
in the next year

298
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
good job guys good job good job

299
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
well i would like to speak about tv that

300
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,839
from gerald chapulin why do you have

301
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
those tv sets

302
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
hello hello

303
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,279
yes

304
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
this is the contest with a lot of tv

305
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,720
sets as i've been making jokes it might

306
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,040
seem that it's a panasonic samsung and

307
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,519
other tv sets what else do you have over

308
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,240
there

309
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
well by the way this is a joke uh

310
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
partially truthful because tv said some

311
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
tv sets

312
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
somebody have been done something to

313
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
them

314
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,800
it's i guess bypass contest the contest

315
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,040
uh i remember this contest since

316
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,639
yesterday

317
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,560
he doesn't even understand what should

318
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,639
be bypassed well i've tried to explain

319
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,240
it well it seems that there's a lot of

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
participants and you they're sitting in

321
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
with notebooks and they're doing

322
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,560
something no atms money are not provided

323
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
nfc are not being sold

324
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
but nevertheless the work has been done

325
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
and by the way participants well this

326
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
year there's a great number of

327
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
achievements more than 100 100 one

328
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
person and all of them came here not all

329
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,079
of them

330
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,639
uh yeah the contest was available

331
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,199
remotely and somebody have connected

332
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,560
from the house well that's

333
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
understandable and what was done

334
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,480
and this contest is very similar to

335
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,040
well participants are they look similar

336
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,639
to some criminals or bad people who

337
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,560
penetrated into the network and they're

338
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,639
trying to get access to different

339
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,120
machines but in our case

340
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
participants have been getting flags

341
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,000
from six specially prepared machines

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,399
vulnerabilities were simple ones flags

343
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,040
also were hidden not too deep but the

344
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
contest is called ideas bypass ideas as

345
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
a system which discovers and can prevent

346
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
those attacks so if the system has

347
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
discovered certain attack from the

348
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,360
participant

349
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
it has blocked his connection this

350
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
attack

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
and he got a message that his attack was

352
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
blocked

353
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
what the magic of tv

354
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,600
you've been speaking about it

355
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,920
this is unrepeated the magic of tv

356
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
repeat it

357
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,880
well it's very interesting

358
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,959
we had contests which are very difficult

359
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,320
to be visualized which are very

360
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,639
difficult to explain to julia and even

361
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,920
more difficult

362
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,519
and this year

363
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,959
one of these goals and sub goals

364
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,560
was not just to make interesting

365
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,480
competition but also to experiment with

366
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
formats in such a way so that we'll be

367
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,000
able to explain contests

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
and what julia has remembered that

369
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,320
hackers can break tv from samsung i

370
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,079
remember there's also services that have

371
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,160
to be broken but that's how you see it

372
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
and confirmed number of participants

373
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
have increased

374
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,959
and the interest of projects have

375
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,279
increased and the chance

376
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,680
of getting

377
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,639
[Music]

378
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,480
from blinking

379
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,839
light

380
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,279
and of course this is the only problem

381
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,560
that possibly existed but nobody had any

382
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
uh

383
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
how many winners do you have we will be

384
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,839
awarded three first places

385
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,720
yes i remember you had monetary prizes

386
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,839
all from atms

387
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,720
sasha

388
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
can you give some more intellect

389
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,440
artificial intellect into this team

390
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,240
yeah into our beautiful team what have

391
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,079
you done this year for your

392
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,839
competitors

393
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,120
competitors well first of all we had eye

394
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
track

395
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,480
and in framework of this track we had

396
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,959
dave with presentations we had stand

397
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,920
where we had to try

398
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
to differentiate

399
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,079
a generated face from real picture yes

400
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,199
i've seen it but i have not understood

401
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
should i click it yes we had to find all

402
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,959
real images and click them

403
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,320
statistically

404
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
more than 500 participants in course of

405
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,639
the first day but and only half of them

406
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
from half of the images they can

407
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,839
differentiate them and there's a lot of

408
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
things to learn from them okay so

409
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,959
this reality inability of the artificial

410
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,319
intelligence is available and there was

411
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,439
a technical

412
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
contest which is called the ctf

413
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,199
it was an individual contest for

414
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
security people

415
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,119
who are used to this classical format

416
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
and for specialists uh on deathcon

417
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,400
science

418
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
in order to get more involved in

419
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
problems of security we had eight

420
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,599
challenges all of them were solved but

421
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,240
no participant have solved all of them

422
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
and this is wonderful actually

423
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
you don't have a winner who is uh alone

424
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,320
unanimous one

425
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,240
you didn't have to solve all eight of

426
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,440
them no you shouldn't you don't have to

427
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
score these were a dynamic score

428
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
objectives the more participants were

429
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
solving the

430
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,960
challenge the less it was uh

431
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
priced

432
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
so those who sold very complicated tasks

433
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
they have more points and of course

434
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
definitely we do have winners we do have

435
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,760
winners plus what is interesting is that

436
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
the winner who took the first place he

437
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
was uh solving on his points even

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
yesterday by 6 p.m and we do know that

439
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,360
it's an honest person because he was

440
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,000
sitting in eye track he was listening to

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
presentations he was able to solve these

442
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,799
challenges and he has additional

443
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,080
intellect

444
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
yes

445
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
it's a very significant specialist i

446
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,440
would say

447
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,760
very significant specialist and

448
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
recognizable specialist in the area of

449
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,480
a.i in russia artificial intelligence

450
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
and it's not a surprising result

451
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,160
so you let

452
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
even specialist but it's not honest

453
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
because you have gurus and

454
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,559
um but this uh task about

455
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,640
that data science special doesn't always

456
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
know about security well he learned he

457
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,000
cleared and he came and won

458
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
and even a school kid could get around

459
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,400
him yes and the second place was taken

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,240
by school kid from tomsk yes

461
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,200
respect to tom's school kids but why

462
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,679
only one was he participating remotely

463
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,280
yes he was participating remotely it was

464
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
online contest everybody had the

465
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,600
possibility to participate

466
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,199
how do you evaluate your contest

467
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,320
in organization we have allowed uh two

468
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,559
objectives so with managing them

469
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,600
well you're speaking about a lot of bugs

470
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,320
well every first one uh somebody is

471
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,760
ready to confirm someone is not ready

472
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,039
somebody has a

473
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,919
uh

474
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,360
somebody will close their eyes somebody

475
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
will

476
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,760
but not

477
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
participants they see less of it than

478
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
organizers

479
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,600
okay tell us about your problems

480
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
thank you very much for participants

481
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,000
that you have noticed that that was an

482
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
objective where you had to recognize the

483
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,480
cost of the house and you had to

484
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,640
well to get a flag you had to

485
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,799
fix we fixed their coefficients but we

486
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,720
fixed it and then everybody would be

487
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
solving it everything was wonderful and

488
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
beautiful

489
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
what can you say you stop me i have

490
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
nothing to speak about

491
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
what can you speak about the artificial

492
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,120
intelligence well basically speaking the

493
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
difference between sasha's contest from

494
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,039
other contests is the

495
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
do you remember last year we had uh day

496
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
of logic where we have attracted more

497
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,679
presentations and divided them 50 by 50

498
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,400
presentations and fun

499
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,240
zones this year we've done more emphasis

500
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
on the head zone and

501
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
less broad presentations less of

502
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,679
presentations

503
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,840
so

504
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,300
real didn't have a section

505
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,480
[Music]

506
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,159
he didn't have and i didn't have a

507
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,080
section

508
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
so making presentation about how to

509
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,640
break atms it was not the best solution

510
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
this year

511
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
but sasha yes sasha has a separate whole

512
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,400
with people in it and that's why

513
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,039
not many activities

514
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
interesting from sasha they have not

515
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
been sitting and that's why

516
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,120
this person was able to listen to

517
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,919
presentations and break objectives and

518
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,000
take the first place

519
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
cheap

520
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,240
force outsource

521
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
i've been running around your goals and

522
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
i've figured out that half of listeners

523
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
are in the corridor they are not able to

524
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,879
fit in

525
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
they are trying to get in the queue

526
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
together inside of it they are solving

527
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,240
objectives and they are listening online

528
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
presentations as well i think this is

529
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,440
not an answer

530
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,320
it's an artificial intelligence because

531
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,159
a lot of smart people

532
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,559
is out there so tell me please what's

533
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
going to happen next year

534
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,720
next year

535
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,840
there will be a new contest ideas bypass

536
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
and it will be ideas bypass and maybe

537
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
it's going to have some tv sets

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,720
or maybe something else

539
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,080
don't you want to go to game

540
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,159
and we should move forward do you know

541
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159
yes today

542
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,280
we've been watched by 50 000 people

543
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,840
so please go maybe some of them make

544
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
games

545
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,320
yeah if you make games we are open for

546
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
proposals especially with blockchain

547
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
participation okay sasha

548
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,400
um

549
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,520
and we are thinking about something

550
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
fresh new and interesting

551
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
and the second thing

552
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,559
we would like to build up in the

553
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,679
standoff in order to have full-scale ai

554
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
systems which

555
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,480
are broken by real hackers and they are

556
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,000
out there we will try

557
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
and we'll speak about them next year

558
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
what happened and why payment village is

559
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,799
not inside of the standoff

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
there is a bank

561
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
there is one with gbo

562
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,720
really

563
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
dozens of workstations

564
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
and participants have no manual desire

565
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
to get around and understand how the atm

566
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,640
works how the cache office works how the

567
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
view works

568
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
they are shooting from the helicopter

569
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,039
while we have totally different

570
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
situation they're sitting next to this

571
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
atm and they're sitting there until they

572
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,919
will clear the situation and crossing

573
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,400
the hedgehog with a snake it's possible

574
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,640
yeah but they are adding to each other

575
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
that's why for the second second year in

576
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
a row we're trying to do it so that

577
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
these systems will be standing there and

578
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,880
there

579
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,480
we're not trying to compare or compete

580
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,640
they do their job beautifully okay
