1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,319
i'm not going to say hi i will say hi

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,919
only to those who are connected to me

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,440
right now and right now they will speak

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,400
about vulnerability management

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,080
and i think we're going to speak about

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,519
that

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,320
as surprising as it may seem

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,480
but this recommendation i will speak

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,400
with a beautiful girl whose name is

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,159
anastasia zuyava right

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,480
because you live in my head with another

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
name

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,040
also has a several products of positive

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,360
max patrol wasn't vulnerability

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
management max patrol 8 and expire

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,040
starship

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,150
yes

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,960
[Music]

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
can you tell me please why regular

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
scanning of vulnerability because we're

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,199
speaking about vulnerabilities is not

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
sufficient why

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,760
because we've been speaking about

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
vulnerabilities speaking speaking

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,159
discovery discovery responding and

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,560
responding reporting reporting

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
but the conversation about scanning is

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
the first one

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
well this the question is what is the

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
purpose of this scanning and why do we

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,640
need all of these and

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
during the standoff and real life the

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
main objective is to minimize

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
possibility

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,640
so that the criminals would not be

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
traded into the company

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,560
and it wouldn't be so they wouldn't do

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
it

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
and everything what we do with this

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
scanning why do we need it what is to be

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
done with it well we've scanned the

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
vulnerability

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,600
and usually they scan they specialize

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
this vulnerability the i.t security guys

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
in the company then they have to close

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
this vulnerability i.t guys

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
and this is the most complicated part

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
informational security people live in

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
the part of my paradigm of vulnerability

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,759
they think how vulnerable uh and how

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,280
critical they are for the company nit

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
guys are responsible for the stability

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479
of the process

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,360
and

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
these two systems are facing each other

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,280
and then we have to understand how can

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
we find agreement with both of them so

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
that in the end run

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
vulnerabilities would be close and you

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,319
should lose those vulnerabilities

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,760
through which

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,000
there's a higher probability of attacks

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
and how can you find agreement with them

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
well our company propagates this point

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
of view and also share it that it's a

66
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
right one there should be two pillars

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,519
the first one

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,959
is when you have regular scanning and

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
regular patch management this is the

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
main thing yes

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
so in advance together information

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
security with business with a t you

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
agree when which systems are being

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,879
updated when you patch them

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,040
this could be a different regulations

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
depending on the type of asset

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
simply speaking if we are talking about

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
windows

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,879
the windows update every month

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
then i t people say well we need one

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
week for testing one week

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,440
for

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
roll it out in the organization we know

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
that in two weeks after the patch

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
production we should check it have they

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
done it or not

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
two weeks isn't it too long

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
it depends on the organization

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
we have to look not at every

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,360
vulnerability as the informational

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
security but we should look whether the

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,319
regulations are followed or not

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
if they're followed how systematically

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
it happens we should look at this

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,799
therefore the system should help us to

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
discover it and the second pillar is

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
when something awful has been published

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
something bad something that everybody

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
is using and for this we have to we have

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,239
to use it and if the first system is not

101
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
available

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
to rolling out of this update so this is

103
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
something bad

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,760
will be

105
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
lost in a number of those tickets for

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
reliability processing and nobody will

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
be able to cope with it physically

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
otherwise if we have planned process

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,680
which we follow then when something bad

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,799
comes

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,080
in the

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
security will pay attention to these

113
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
and of course i t guys are not gonna be

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,639
overloaded with tickets but if you came

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,479
to them you have to fix it and something

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
has to be solved about it

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,919
well i still don't understand how

118
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,919
effectively can we build the process

119
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,840
from the point of view of the team

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
what should be done with the team

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
you have to build a smart system which

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,919
is going to report to them what happens

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
in the beginning you should take the

124
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
business

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,479
yeah

126
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,880
and you should ask them what is critical

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
to you which

128
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
well do you understand of well business

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
is not going to tell you about any

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
vulnerabilities of course you shouldn't

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,199
ask about vulnerabilities well the wheel

132
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,919
flies away centrifuge have stopped and

133
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,280
things like that

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080
what is critical to you which business

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,600
processes uh are awful and then

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
informational security and i.t guys are

137
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
looking at what in these processes which

138
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
systems participate in them and what

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
this particular system does

140
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,919
to your infrastructure what is

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,800
responsible for and they define its

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
criticality criticality

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
from the point of view whether the

144
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
criminal can enter through this system

145
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
or not to the perimeter maybe it's

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
outside sticking outside of the

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,840
perimeter and is it a key

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
which has to be protected or maybe this

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
is some kind of a system through which

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
you can make an attack

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
and computer of chief accountant or

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
maybe computer over the admin of the

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
company so things like that and all this

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,400
has to be classified

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
distributed and you have to understand

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
what should we pay attention as a first

157
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,479
priority production of which access

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,680
assets and then secondly

159
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,520
what is in the test zone is not as

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
important but the infrastructure in the

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,639
company is dynamic today you have

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
determined the computer of the

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
accountant but tomorrow one has left and

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,520
two arrived

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
the previous one makes me happy yeah

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
they've been making jokes on me

167
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
and even you should understand well good

168
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,199
question i understand well this is a key

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,039
question because in the foundation of

170
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,360
vulnerability management we should have

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
asset management and we should

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
understand what is being protected and

173
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,880
in order to check this system we should

174
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
include everything that is available in

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
the company

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,199
so it's a question to civil scaling

177
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,960
if you submit the list of ip addresses

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
and you follow it

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,319
then as a next step

180
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,880
you cannot be confident that maybe

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
suddenly you didn't know about some

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
service maybe some of you guys have

183
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,080
rolled something out and they have not

184
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
informed you about that so this process

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
should be continuous and this is really

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,599
cool if uh

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
vulnerability management system can

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
upload data from other information

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
security systems which will add to this

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
asset related information so do i

191
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
properly understand you right now you're

192
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
telling us this this process that you

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
have listed to us it's not a story about

194
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
making a person to do everything

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
manually no it's a story about some

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,919
technology

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
as for manual you have to agree with

198
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,440
this person what is important to this

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
person and when they will patch it

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
according to regulations and then after

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,240
these rules vulnerability detection

202
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
inventorization of course the system

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
should follow them up

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,840
and it's very

205
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,000
cool it helps the information security

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,479
officer to make it faster and better and

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,080
how many of those systems do we have

208
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,560
right now

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
in the russian market you mean

210
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
well who knows right now we are working

211
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,199
on this market because well i will speak

212
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
about my system okay can you tell me how

213
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,440
many pieces

214
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,199
yes

215
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
different things

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
we believe that vulnerability management

217
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
is an advanced thing for us another

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
thing that we discussed and sometimes we

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,919
discuss about

220
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,720
vulnerabilities and vulnerability

221
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
management

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,319
asset management and i hear statements

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
like trendy vulnerabilities and all this

224
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
process that you've been discussing

225
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
right now is it a process for regular

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,559
vulnerabilities or non-regular

227
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,120
vulnerabilities and how this trendy are

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
different from non-trendy from the

229
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,000
regular ones

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
the process is mostly built for usual

231
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
vulnerabilities and you know 99.9

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
of vulnerabilities they should be

233
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
included into this regular process

234
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
however trendy ones

235
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,399
we can say that they can be used by uh

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
criminals in real attacks and according

237
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
to our experts they will be

238
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,839
used in the wild nature

239
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,320
experience and this is our experts our

240
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
pen testers are researching them they

241
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,440
are looking whether they have exploits

242
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
what is the direction of the exploit and

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
then

244
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,839
they select best of the

245
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,880
best vulnerabilities which have to be

246
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,750
closed first of all

247
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,040
[Music]

248
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,200
this is not just recalculation of all

249
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,080
the discovered vulnerabilities because

250
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,880
we

251
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,080
give this rating to everybody and you

252
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,560
have to decide which of them have to be

253
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
removed as fast as possible and we have

254
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,000
to concentrate on 100

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
the toughest

256
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
vulnerabilities and every team will be

257
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,200
able to close them

258
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
and you have to work on them as fast as

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
possible and how the work is work built

260
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
with them yes separately

261
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,279
for example if we're speaking about

262
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,040
systems

263
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,050
there's a separate widget for them

264
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,079
[Music]

265
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
and the system allows it and it

266
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
remembers how they've scanned these

267
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
assets what's available in the network

268
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
and when they send database of knowledge

269
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
of neural abilities

270
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
they can recalculate applicability of

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,839
vulnerabilities to a certain

272
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,320
area and we can say that on the basis of

273
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
these data that you've just scanned

274
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
one week ago

275
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,760
is this vulnerability available in the

276
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,360
system or not but you have to clearly

277
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,959
understand that it's available but then

278
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,240
you can

279
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,399
do something quickly and then you can

280
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,240
launch additional scanning

281
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
so

282
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
this is very useful in the case

283
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
as a rule a scanning of the

284
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
infrastructure it takes a lot of time

285
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,800
and of course you have to get through to

286
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
the owner of the system you have to get

287
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
permissions for this and uh

288
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,959
think about this one you need to have

289
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
fast reaction to something very

290
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
dangerous and we propose to have a fast

291
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,680
recalculation of gps scanning

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
just recently

293
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
we've seen recommendations of ncki uh

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
work with vulnerabilities and you cannot

295
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
get around these recommendations

296
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,959
because

297
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,279
it's important and we have to live with

298
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
it so can you tell me please

299
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
what is your position about these

300
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,680
recommendations and how do they feed

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
in the approach that you've been

302
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
speaking about

303
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,120
what is our position

304
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,880
we have to follow these recommendations

305
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
and every company can interpret them

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
differently

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,160
and

308
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,079
uh in include something additional to

309
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,560
them there is an algorithm and what is

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
the main idea of this algorithm is that

311
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
in order to close some vulnerability we

312
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,760
have to get updated and right now

313
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
in connection with certain events it

314
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
happens that right now we have a risk

315
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,839
that these updates

316
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,519
will have some undocumented

317
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,000
possibilities and something might happen

318
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
with the system and we have to evaluate

319
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
all the risks

320
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,360
what is more important and more

321
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
dangerous to us what can be attacked

322
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
through this vulnerability which has not

323
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,959
been closed or the fact that you have an

324
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,959
update and something wrong can get into

325
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,160
the system

326
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
and this is a very serious question and

327
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,560
it's very difficult to solve it that's

328
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,639
why we've been offered to follow the

329
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,260
algorithm of a solution you look at

330
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,079
[Music]

331
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,320
in which software this vulnerability is

332
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,800
available who is the manufacturer who is

333
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
the vendor from which country it comes

334
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,040
from what is the type of vulnerability

335
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
rc or maybe something else what is the

336
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,480
assessment uh on

337
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
cbs test level where is it located how

338
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
is it influencing this particular

339
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
service where is it located or how is it

340
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
influencing the business of the company

341
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
and then you are looking at

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
whether there's a chance of removing it

343
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
or maybe it's better to wait for a while

344
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,519
or you have to remove it immediately uh

345
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,360
following this cycle so basically

346
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
everything that i've been telling you

347
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
before prior to this uh should follow

348
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,639
this process

349
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,959
and i'm repeating myself

350
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
and what's so cool about it uh speaking

351
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
about our product

352
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
when we've looked at it you know we have

353
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
introduced certain filters into the

354
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
system which allow us to work following

355
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
this algorithm and by the way in the

356
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
next release

357
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
we want for these filters to be out of

358
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
the box we have created the manual for

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,560
our users so please take these requests

360
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,240
build them in such a way and that's how

361
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
they should work and a week from now we

362
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
are going to present new release

363
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
in a week it's not going to be a

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,480
methodological

365
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
story

366
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
and we are going to tell you what's

367
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
happening with this yes you've been

368
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
asking

369
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
in one week we're going to tell you

370
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
what's going to be happening in the

371
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,319
release

372
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
our time

373
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,519
so top five advices on how to organize

374
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,160
effective

375
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
vulnerability

376
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,519
management yes

377
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
i think that you have told us about them

378
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,920
but let's bring it in the bullet points

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,000
okay i'm recording it everybody's

380
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,720
recording number one number one first of

381
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
all we are checking whether we know

382
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
everything about the infrastructure

383
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
whether it's a part of something that's

384
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
being checked

385
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
if it does not allow you to use the

386
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,880
means then

387
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,639
we go to i.t guys and we're trying to

388
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,120
achieve this the second thing we

389
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,440
[Music]

390
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
what is the most critical thing in order

391
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,560
for this to happen

392
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
not allowable not admissible events

393
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,560
inadmissible something that is should

394
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
become impossible number three we are

395
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,279
looking at which services and systems

396
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
are involved in these inadmissible

397
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
events and then we separate them we look

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,800
at them in more detail we follow them

399
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,079
with number four we discover

400
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,680
vulnerabilities yes number four we find

401
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,440
agreement with it guys

402
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
we add to these systems that we have

403
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,759
separated and then afterwards we're

404
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,040
looking at how much do they follow these

405
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
regulations and then we look at the

406
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,519
trend all over the company

407
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,959
how's that working so these are five

408
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,320
