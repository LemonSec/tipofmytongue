hello alexi hello vladimir

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,960
how comfortable do you feel how you're

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,039
being addressed in real life

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
very close people they call me by name

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,000
but in the internet in the course of

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,559
last 24 years

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,200
i'm used to my nickname and everybody

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
knows me by my nickname

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
and during this period of time nobody

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
was able to

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,000
have negative rhyme to my nickname i've

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,879
invented 98 we've been playing counter

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,160
strike in the club

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
and i've invented this nickname and i

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
still have this nickname i like it

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799
and it's always free at all services yes

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,560
it is sounds very simple

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
but you cannot immediately spell it

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,799
well

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,040
how the hub community looks like today

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
and which changes do you have in recent

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
days

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,560
well i should begin by saying that

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
hubber is a ugc platform a platform

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
where the whole content has been user

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,439
generated so we divided editorial user

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,400
corporate however even in the companies

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
in any of the companies

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
they create this content and share this

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
content therefore

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,399
[Music]

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,200
once again we have a hack attack

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
once in a while our broadcast will have

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
such breaks which is wonderful it's a

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
certain action yes it is an action

44
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,640
so community hubble community is a very

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,719
tough combination of users uh corporate

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,640
representatives etc

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
uh register we have more than one

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,119
million users registered in the

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,479
beginning you've said that largest

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
community yes it is very large

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
and uh how many active users out of this

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
million regularly present on the

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
platform well regular ones i cannot say

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
exactly but

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
i have a number with my hands the

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,440
writing authors in the course of the

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,520
month about 900 people every month

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000
authors who write at least one

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
publication in course of the month more

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,640
commenters more readers

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,920
but a complete number i don't remember

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,680
but according to social networks like

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
contact uh twitter hubber is the

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
small uh

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,239
drop in the sea but uh speaking about

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
very topical community hubber is a big

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
one

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
well

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,760
close communication of users and

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,399
companies

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
16 years

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,879
it's developing

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
which changes happened what communities

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
what changes in it

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
well in the context of the events which

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,159
happened in the beginning of this

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
there are year

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
events which were not specific to

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
previous periods years months

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
the first one is that we

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,799
have

82
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,599
type of users as read-only users with

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,480
less rights on the side

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
and you can anybody can get registered

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
anybody can get registered like this

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
in february march and april

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
there was the significant growth of

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,319
these users the growth of registrations

89
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,200
of these users so some time ago users

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
said okay guys can you give us an

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
opportunity to get registered to make

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
the line and give us an opportunity to

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
write personal messages we said okay

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
sometimes you want to ask something

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
communication is a good story

96
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,879
but then they say okay guys can you give

97
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,200
us possibility to write comments okay

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
you give them a finger and they will

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
bite your hand up to the elbow

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,238
they ask for the right and right now

101
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,759
it's up to the reverse story they say

102
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
okay let's close this door because

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
we observe the growth of registrations

104
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
of users who bring very bad usefulness

105
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,840
what do you think about doubtful

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
usefulness they don't write articles but

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,479
they think themselves to be experts in

108
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,560
issues of import substitution

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
immigration

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
production of different elders and other

111
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,360
things

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,840
and they send their

113
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
comments well not like experts as if

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
experts but they initiate different

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
discussions which very often are not

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,479
welcome to like political discussions

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,520
and

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
rough comments uh obscene comments

119
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
we are happy to all the users but these

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
users they bring certain problems to us

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
and the growth of their registrations

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
was noticeable

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
so we had to invent some moderation

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
tools so that we could

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,199
cooperate with these users

126
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,880
but hubber is a ugc platform uh users

127
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
create content

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
etc

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
so maybe this is not a really dynamic

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
story it's not that you can take

131
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
immediately and remove

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
some bad user from the site but

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
nevertheless

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
users

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,800
are detecting those who

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
to neutralize this person and this

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
organism is getting cleaned from all the

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
communications on several topics uh

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
trigger topics and they are kind of

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
showing the image that you like the fire

141
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,000
and all the zombies are running to you

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
this is interesting yes this is a very

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
interesting practice

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
many people are not happy they say well

145
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
we have some but people getting

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
registered but we understand that we

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
will see the number of registrations

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
growing

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
and those who don't behave well the

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,160
audience is not going to be happy with

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
them as well so this is the first change

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,960
which happened since the beginning of

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,840
the year it was

154
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,319
noticed the second thing we have changed

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,120
the character of voting so we have

156
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
read-only users without the right of

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
voting by default and we have

158
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
users

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
who have the right of voting so if

160
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
previously

161
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
seventy percent of votes of these users

162
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
were positive

163
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,479
right now the number of votes uh for

164
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,120
other voters is a negative one

165
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
there were positive voices and now

166
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,039
they're negative voices why is it like

167
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
that why is it like that these are the

168
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
voices for karma there are voices for

169
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,199
publications then in publications as it

170
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
was that's how it is users are

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
evaluating good material and negative

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
material they are kind of adding some

173
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,560
minuses

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,520
and the karma voices karma votes is an

175
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
explanation

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,800
that's how the political arrival looks

177
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
in the community when some event happens

178
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
and in a given case

179
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,280
this story

180
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,919
users start discussing it and in the

181
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,840
framework of thematical community not

182
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
everybody likes it and people

183
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,479
are opening some of their tools which

184
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
allow them to

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,479
more intensively return this story back

186
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
for example if you will analyze it these

187
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
minuses in more details

188
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,919
there are some users which just have

189
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,199
registered so this is a big organism but

190
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
it's a self-purging organs in places

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
where it's not possible we're trying to

192
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,840
help them go

193
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,919
self-purge well these are two main

194
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
changes and modifications some were

195
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,400
under the question mark

196
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,639
okay it would also be interesting to

197
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
understand uh what

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,039
mood you see on the side of the users do

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,960
you see any changes in the mood

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
which is more skeptical or maybe more

201
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,919
acute or maybe

202
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
other moods you observe or we speak

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,840
about big number of people about great

204
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
community

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
which has some internal composition and

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
state

207
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,479
it's going to be difficult to give you a

208
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,039
brief answer but different states you

209
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,440
can feel them

210
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,958
the first thing that would like to say

211
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,719
is that

212
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
it's doubtful that there are people

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
amongst us who are ready

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
for

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
such

216
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,279
psychological moral physical and other

217
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
and it was noticeable even by the

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
activities on the side

219
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
suddenly for a certain period of time

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,760
nobody was understanding what is to be

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,560
done

222
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
and the activity has dropped

223
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,480
significantly well weekly

224
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
we have calls amongst our companies we

225
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
discuss different matrixes

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
relatively speaking

227
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
all site content can be divided into

228
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,600
three categories uh cooperative ugc user

229
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,080
and editorial content with normal uh

230
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
temperature with normal market situation

231
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
the proportion is about 40 40 20 20

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
percent editorial and uh then uh users

233
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
and companies uh hand in hand

234
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,439
but after all this story has happened

235
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,160
corporate bloggers have stopped

236
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,720
significantly there was 40 percent now

237
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
it's 20 percent

238
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,920
users also didn't understand what is to

239
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
be done in our editorial office uh had

240
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
to continue shedding light on all this

241
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,519
story and the number of the amounts of

242
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,160
content in percentage well has increased

243
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
significantly increased

244
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
and in the course of one month these

245
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
mental forces was happening and in the

246
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
end of march they already have

247
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
stabilized this

248
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,839
so everything came back to the initial

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
condition

250
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,880
initially speaking about the mood users

251
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,440
indeed have

252
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
some feelings that well we have to run

253
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
somewhere we have to hide i need a

254
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
notebook for this work and i can do it

255
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
from anywhere else and then we could see

256
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,560
higher number of publications about the

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
topic of iit immigration

258
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
some people describe their experience

259
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
and they share it and harbor evaluates

260
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
it so there's a new topic

261
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,720
it always was available there

262
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
the immigration topic i t immigration

263
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
was always on this side it's a separate

264
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
topic at our site it's a separate hub

265
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,239
but it became the most popular here

266
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
on the second or on the third place

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
after the informational security

268
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,480
etcetera previously it was a flagship

269
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
topic

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
and people are sharing their experience

271
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
some people say well i was able to do

272
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
that i wasn't able to do that but these

273
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
some other people say okay

274
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
this was all discussed very actively and

275
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,279
people who was thinking about writing or

276
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,399
not writing they have understood that

277
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,320
they have to write they've shared it and

278
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
then we took all these publications and

279
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,240
we transferred them to our social

280
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
networks and some readers in social

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
network they thought that we are

282
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,959
lobbying

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
escaping

284
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,399
well this is not the tutorial content

285
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
this is user generated content

286
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
ugc

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,519
as it looks like they share their own

288
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
experience not like you've read the book

289
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,399
and then you

290
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
got information no they share their own

291
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,719
experiences

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
and this topic becomes more and more

293
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,000
popular but can you give us top five

294
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
topics which are very

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
interesting at harbor

296
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
well in the first place i think it

297
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
wasn't it still is informational

298
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,279
security it's a hub uh with the biggest

299
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
number of subscribers not the biggest

300
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
one but it's very active it's the

301
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
biggest by activity-wise the second one

302
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,119
i think

303
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,320
i would like to divine it but it's a

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
scientific popular topic and we're a

305
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
section

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,839
scientific popular

307
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,760
materials people are discussing

308
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
everything from

309
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,240
newspapers to telescopes and this spring

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,399
was really

311
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,440
well known by the topics

312
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,040
so i think due to this news it was much

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
simpler for the audience because they've

314
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
been discussing somebody made a picture

315
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
of the orbital space station from his

316
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
window somebody did something else

317
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
another topic which is really popular uh

318
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
recently it's import substitution this

319
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,560
baikal albrus

320
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,079
operating systems some software

321
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
they've been actively discussing about

322
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,519
okay guys okay

323
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,480
let's accept uh the situation as it is

324
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
given

325
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,959
and then think about the future let's

326
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
search for new tools let's invent some

327
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,760
new tools let's get united uh not all of

328
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
this was public among users and in the

329
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
comments

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
only maybe some first steps but if

331
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
you're interested please write any

332
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
personal mail but very actively it is

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
being discussed uh in this telegram

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
channel

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
so

336
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
no yeah button vision and i see how

337
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
people are walking around

338
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
which is an advantage because you can

339
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
see how people communicate

340
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,639
because we don't want to have all

341
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
communications on hub we want to connect

342
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
people

343
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,040
so that we would have same thinkers from

344
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,279
all corners of the world

345
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,800
so one of our main objectives

346
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,399
we wanted to maximize in these difficult

347
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,120
conditions

348
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
to maximize people without dividing them

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
into the camps because any war comes to

350
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,639
an end

351
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
and people will have to live on

352
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
and those who have been working on the

353
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,079
side of developers they will continue

354
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,000
working developers and they will have to

355
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
communicate with those people they've

356
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
been communicating with previously

357
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
therefore

358
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
all these political discussions

359
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
they divide users and we're trying to

360
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,320
stop it

361
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
uh our position has been announced about

362
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
the story in the very beginning but

363
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,519
nevertheless

364
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
users

365
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
if they

366
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,519
have some polarity of opinions and

367
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,360
somebody get a label to another one it's

368
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
going to be very difficult to rule out

369
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
from our side so our main objective

370
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,160
is like leopold hey

371
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
friends let's be friends

372
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
you're from this country he's from that

373
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
country let's be friends okay speaking

374
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,199
about the content consumption format how

375
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,519
do you think is it changing and

376
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
whether it's changing

377
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
not as it's supposed to yes would you

378
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,720
like the best one

379
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
well here's another question if you will

380
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,120
not immediately ask for it if you enter

381
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,079
web archive and if you open harbor 2007

382
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,240
2008

383
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
you will see that most of the

384
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
applications were small articles and

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
rubble have purchased this that that

386
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
that it was like a tweet format

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
but in the course of decade uh hubber

388
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
have evolved in the direction of long

389
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
rates

390
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,880
practically every publication

391
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,519
is a very long like tens of thousands of

392
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
symbols and the audience uh looking at

393
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,000
the readership they read it pretty well

394
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
uh a simple example i've been

395
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,800
communicating with an employee

396
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,560
of bigger boy and asking how many

397
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
publications do you have how many

398
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,560
comments said thousands so i said okay

399
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,920
alexander

400
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,759
1 000 publications a day how can you

401
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,680
moderate it

402
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,040
well but understand sometimes

403
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
publications one picture we don't have

404
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,590
anything like that

405
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,240
[Music]

406
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,759
we have long grids

407
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,360
and the audience is used to them but we

408
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,279
understand that audience is changing

409
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,040
those who have had 10 years ago

410
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
for them it becomes much more

411
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
interesting to read some other materials

412
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,399
if previously they've been reading about

413
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,880
development right now they maybe want to

414
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
read about something

415
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
but also we see a new generation for

416
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,160
whom it is more specific to have a clip

417
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
thinking

418
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,320
so we are thinking about our own show

419
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
format

420
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
not twitter no stories not facebook but

421
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
something brief

422
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
acceptable

423
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,880
fast food

424
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
and the news as a separate format came

425
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,440
to us several years ago

426
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
and we had to introduce it by small

427
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
doses we have understood that people

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,560
read news uh from other platforms so we

429
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,079
liberate and always stay that pharma

430
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,839
didn't take this piece of traffic

431
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,839
previously and we're cutting away these

432
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,959
people

433
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,319
if we don't take this from it so we

434
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
created separate entities separate

435
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
section we've been we've been writing

436
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,678
not long read but short news

437
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,240
this has happened and the news has been

438
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
added and they've been discussing those

439
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,599
news and they have understood that this

440
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,240
is how they demanded they read it

441
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,079
and right now the editorial content

442
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
sometimes traffic wise

443
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
is higher than user or corporate content

444
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
irrespectively to the fact that

445
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
quantitatively it's less

446
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,400
so in the beginning it was written by

447
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
the editorial office but then we gave

448
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
the possibility to companies to write

449
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
news and then we've opened it for

450
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
everybody

451
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
right now news is a separate entity

452
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,799
users like this brief format and there's

453
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,559
a big line with long reads

454
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,039
and sometimes it happens that we have

455
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,600
new interactive things in different

456
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,880
formats like public polls research

457
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
we collect information with google forms

458
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
etc

459
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
thank you very much alexi truthfully

460
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
sharing information

461
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
in the community

462
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
it's very important to share information

463
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
because it's a very close community

464
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
and such sources as hubber harbor

465
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
they do help these

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
because when it is interesting for the

467
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,200
users to generate content

468
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,559
to share their experience and they are

469
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,919
challenging each other they give

470
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,520
challenges to each other and ratings to

471
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
each other it's a great experience for

472
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
us for russia in creating such platforms

473
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
i wish you

474
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,960

and sustainability in current conditions

476
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400

477
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
