1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,040
can you hear me

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,320
uh good afternoon all of you my name is

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,759
andrei pruschen

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,040
i'm the head of consulting

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
to build security operation centers on

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,479
premise

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,640
with customers of telecom solar

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
i've spent quite a lot of time working

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,400
as a consultant in professional services

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
implementing information security

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
solutions and one of the projects was

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
about security operation centers

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
i'll talk today more about the

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,040
specificity of building them how to make

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
it so that you can build them themselves

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
yourselves and how to avoid common

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,039
mistakes

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,719
had we had

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
uh not such a big stage and had it been

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,840
closer to the audience you could ask me

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,079
could you ask me why a company that's

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,719
doing information security services is

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,760
going to talk about building on-premise

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,879
socks

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
so the answer is quite simple

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
not all customers not all companies

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
are prepared to pass to outsource this

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
function and they want to try or maybe

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
they already build such a center

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
within themselves

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
also i would

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,880
ask you to pay attention to the three

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
trends the first one is the geopolitical

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,159
situation as it has been

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
exacerbated since the end of last year

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
uh which pushed people to

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,560
uh

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,119
prioritize stock building and also

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,759
secondly the company

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,360
the companies that

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,799
own

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,720
critical information infrastructure

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
sites

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
have finally

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
approached a situation that they need to

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
implement monitoring function

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,280
they have

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
done a configuration categorization

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
implementation

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,799
of

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,399
information security

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
infrastructure and have now passed the

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,639
next stage also and the third

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,679
factor

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
was that in the beginning of may a new

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
degree of the president of the russian

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
federation has been

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
published for

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
additional

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
requirements to information security in

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
the russian federation

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,040
this

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
applies to both

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
federal

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,319
executive our bodies and other

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,760
organizations

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
so all this led to a situation where the

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
number of requests uh and questions

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
about building your own socks has grown

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,120
considerably

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
so let's take a look at the

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
typical

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
points that arise when discussing an

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,239
on-premise sock the classic picture uh

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,040
how to do it with high quality fast and

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
uh not in in not expensively actually uh

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
this can all be implemented this can all

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
be complied with

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,239
but of course there are certain risks

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
that can uh your company can face in the

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,360
short midterm and long term let's start

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,720
with the most

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
interesting

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,879
option where you want to do it

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
with high quality

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,200
and it's not expensive

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
it can't be done but for this you need

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,159
to have an expert or a team of experts

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
who already have

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
practical experience kind of an

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
in-source consultant

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
who will

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
help

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
you to avoid risks

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
so that you shouldn't come back to

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
re-work

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,480
but this

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
entails a lot of risk so if this person

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
leaves then your company you're staying

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
with nothing

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
it would be difficult for you to

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
continue the project if the pro such a

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
person leaves it the next option fast

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,360
and cheap

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
it can also be done but it looks like a

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,799
potemkin village so on paper everything

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
would look fine all the components would

108
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
be there the processes would be

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
described the content will exist within

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
cm but the first pen test will show you

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
that the sock doesn't see anything

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,720
no detection and response is happening

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,880
so again it looks like there are a lot

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
of risks about this approach

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
and the top right

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,919
corner you have with high quality and

117
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,520
inexpensively

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
this is also and

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
quite a frequent option uh that people

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,520
take

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
but there are risks about the time of

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
implementation so it may take years

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
three to five years for instance and

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
also there are such things as a lack of

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
funds for instance you're going to have

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
a small team at the starting point and

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
you're going to have certain

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
technologies missing that you would not

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
be

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,199
able

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
to

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
tackle with this team so you implement

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
something and then uh a year or two

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,759
later

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,039
you start implementing another

136
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,039
technology but then you find out the

137
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
previous technology doesn't isn't

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
compatible with the new ones and so you

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
can you know

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
go this circle

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
over and over again until you find so i

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
think uh the uh best approach is to do

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,880
it with high quality fast the its only

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,840
drawback is that

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,039
you it costs a lot and the only way is

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,840
to

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
attract or invite consultants who

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
already have a lot of experience uh to

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
avoid the biggest

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
hazards

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
that people run into when implementing

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,919
stock

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
if we consider a project to build a

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
in-house security operation center

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,199
different people have different

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,479
attitudes

157
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,400
some people uh

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
think it's quite

159
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
easy and simple implement cm hire people

160
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,160
and

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
start working but we of course

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
understand that it's a

163
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
more complicated story that

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
takes time and also has a lot of

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
building blocks so that you need to put

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
together a certain way so this would be

167
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
unique individual uh combination uh that

168
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
should address the unique risk of each

169
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,680
specific company so we was placed in

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,639
three

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,199
phases uh pre-project

172
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
phase where you collect information

173
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,639
about the situation the second is

174
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
building and launching a security

175
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,840
operating center and finally uh

176
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,360
operation and maintenance

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
so at the pre-project phase the main

178
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
goal is to understand the risks or

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,360
inadmissible events that can affect the

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
business the company's business

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,639
all

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
this requires either a bill sohib

183
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,960
or a security operations center

184
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
if

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
the soc is already there and

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,759
you want to modernize it

187
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,440
then a maturity

188
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
review would be useful what to do so

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
that it could move to the new level and

190
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
finally

191
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
the most important phase

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
is to create a concept

193
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
considering all the inadmissible events

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
all the attack scenarios that you have

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
identified in the first phase so you can

196
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
build a project consisting

197
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
organizational measures technical

198
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
measures administrative measures in

199
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
order to create this team

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
split its operation into phases of

201
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,680
prioritized projects and this

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,039
will allow you

203
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
to uh cover all the inadmissible events

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,960
that apply to this company with high

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,759
quality and one by one so what does it

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
contain the design of the soc systems uh

207
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,919
it's not only about cm but other other

208
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,319
systems it's the content

209
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
the most important thing what you have

210
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,000
inside these systems and again it's not

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,960
only the cm content is the content for

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,039
all other systems so this includes

213
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,639
processes and kpi metrics

214
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
employee training and a lot of other

215
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
things

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
and once we've done all this once we

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
build all this it's important to keep

218
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
working with this so you can't uh treat

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
a sock project as a project that has a

220
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
start and finish you need to keep

221
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,160
working on it improving improving it

222
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
because new threats arrive new people

223
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,720
arrive and

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
so

225
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
you can use red teaming exercises as

226
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,039
part of further maintenance

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,399
cyber exercises and such expert supports

228
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,719
activities as forensics early detection

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,958
and other similar

230
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,760
things what you shouldn't forget soc

231
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
can't be separate from all other

232
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
functions of information security if we

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
take a typical and classic model of

234
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
cyber security framework there are five

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
main elements there soc

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
third

237
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,279
they

238
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,640
partly cover

239
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,440
three of them identify

240
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
of as identification of assets to detect

241
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
a detection of infamous security

242
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
incident and respond that's response to

243
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
information security incidents but the

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
system system is not going to be fully

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
fledged without a security system that

246
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
you'll have to implement in the protect

247
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,959
phase or without the training and the

248
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,360
inclusion involvement of

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
the team

250
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,760
that will have to uh provide for the

251
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
restoration if the incidents has

252
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
happened and here unfortunately we have

253
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
to state that there's no system that

254
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
will cover

255
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
in assets or a business process company

256
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
with 100 reliability you always have to

257
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,839
consider that remaining risk as

258
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,120
a reality

259
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
uh what you should start with there are

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
two approaches but we believe the right

261
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,160
approach to building an soc because it

262
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
requires a lot of investments both

263
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
direct investment and in terms of

264
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
the efforts of those people who work in

265
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
the company so therefore you should talk

266
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,079
to business the business customer

267
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
quite often there's a problem here

268
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
because uh

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,560
sock is us to be built

270
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,519
from

271
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
the assets up

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,640
but not from the business logic so here

273
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
we

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
propose to split

275
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,399
it into the two goals or

276
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,680
let's say

277
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
two stakeholders it's business what

278
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,640
support for them in the soc to analyze

279
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,480
the inadmissible events that can happen

280
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,000
and how it affects the company's

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,720
business and try to minimize such events

282
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
and the second

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
thing is to understand the level of

284
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
investment that you need to make the

285
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
priority of these actions and how they

286
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
will affect the minimization of risk

287
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
for the information security chief

288
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,760
information security officer

289
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
it's just not been mentioned here

290
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
so they should have a single language

291
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,519
the same language to talk with business

292
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
why we implement

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
the soc or why so much money is required

294
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
exactly uh to foster those in municipal

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
events

296
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
so what does this eso get

297
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
the

298
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,000
unbiased and accurate indicators of the

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,959
current

300
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
uh security level

301
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
uh

302
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,720
drafting the target

303
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
state of the soc just like normally the

304
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
current states

305
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
target states and how you uh pass the

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
way from the current state to the

307
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
desired states and

308
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
we

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
here come to conclusion that you i need

310
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,079
to start with planning rather than

311
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
buying the systems and what includes the

312
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,200
analysis of cyber risks that's

313
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,839
individual events and

314
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,720
working out a concept for the soc we

315
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,760
have our own method methodology for such

316
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,800
work

317
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,920
that matches inadmissible events with

318
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,959
how the soc functions in fact this is

319
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,120
provided by several components

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
the scenario detection

321
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
the phase

322
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,279
structure of implementation

323
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,320
and

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,279
the

325
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,399
coverage

326
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,560
so all these things

327
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
should be defined at the outset

328
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
including the pace with which it should

329
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
happen the most frequent question

330
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
on premise or mdr

331
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,399
i actually started so with this

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,360
quite often when the customer arrives

333
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,320
you say oh they say that according to

334
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,880
the new uh decree

335
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
and with the new requirements uh

336
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
we uh want to build an soc and i very

337
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
much like uh how it works in algorithm

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
with another customer i just want

339
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,160
uh something like that actually uh which

340
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
way the customer should go depends on

341
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
several factors the finance the economy

342
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
the economics

343
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
and you have to assess a lot of

344
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,279
components hardware software and people

345
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
that will allow you to come up to the

346
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
amount the second point is politics

347
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,800
some companies have

348
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
a policy

349
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,959
not to pass

350
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,240
information security to our sources

351
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
so they need to deal with it themselves

352
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
uh there are also uh some uh

353
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,519
restrictions in some cases for instance

354
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
if the company works in such a region

355
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,519
but there are not enough

356
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
uh qualified talents uh there's no

357
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,560
qualified not enough qualified talent in

358
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,519
the region

359
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
so they just won't be able to hire the

360
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,399
people

361
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,959
and so finally some companies have a

362
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,480
reputation

363
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
component so we're strong and cool and

364
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
we just want to have our own soc he's

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
just like the best guys so

366
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,480
usually

367
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
based on our experience

368
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
we have seen a lot of such situations

369
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
and the graph here shows a picture what

370
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,000
does it say

371
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
it's usually the planning uh goes for

372
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
the long term uh three to five sometimes

373
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,040
to seven years

374
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,320
so if the picture uh compares

375
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
uh with the talk online the option of

376
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,880
your own implementation uh when they

377
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
build their own team or use their own

378
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
technology and at the bottom we see

379
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,279
different variants of the service model

380
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,760
and we run the comparison around the

381
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,360
comparison

382
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,320
for you to better understand

383
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,360
what is

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,079
this comparison if you're not linked to

385
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,959
a specific system or tool

386
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,440
so we have compared several

387
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
cm1 and cm2

388
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,079
options and different ownership models

389
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,959
clouds and sun premise and you see

390
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
that in five years on the five years

391
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
horizon five-year horizon the mdr model

392
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
wins

393
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,959
it quite often

394
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
it's quite often you better use service

395
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,639
financially but

396
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
that doesn't apply to all criteria and

397
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,639
that's normal so what's what general

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,040
recommendation can we give even for the

399
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
time of implementation whether companies

400
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,600
build building something of their own

401
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,399
uh

402
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,040
it's not the

403
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,480
best things

404
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
to pass

405
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
it's actually a useful to pass a

406
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,800
function to an outsourcer

407
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
just to learn

408
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,439
how the

409
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,600
not to outsources and functions firstly

410
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
to give some experience to your own

411
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
specialists and also

412
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,360
to get experience responding

413
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
so you'll have to respond so whether you

414
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
outsource these functions

415
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
uh later but before that you need to do

416
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,040
it yourselves

417
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
and the third point you'll do a fast

418
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
start and we'll start

419
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,839
returning the investment that the

420
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,360
company is

421
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
making

422
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
a risk-oriented soc

423
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,079
does this concept exist at all and does

424
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,360
it make sense

425
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
well it's a matter of debate actually

426
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,959
i've already spoken about two different

427
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,360
approaches start from assets and start

428
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
from risks i believe that the

429
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
risk-oriented approach

430
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,399
is very promising it indeed helps

431
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,199
setting up and implementing

432
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
a security operation center project

433
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,120
correctly and with admissible risks

434
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
this is not a new methodology

435
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,079
here we see several examples

436
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,920
at the bottom of similar methodologies

437
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,519
they're quite new

438
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
in

439
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,199
line one is information security 2.0

440
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,519
from positive technologies then

441
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,480
the

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,959
there's the stack methodology and

443
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,440
american consequence driven cyber

444
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
informed engineering

445
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,240
created in the department of energy of

446
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
the united states for the critical

447
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,399
infrastructure sites and they're all

448
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
talking about the same thing you need to

449
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,040
define inadmissible events uh draft to

450
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,919
detect vectors understand which systems

451
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,359
collect events from which systems from

452
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,079
which sources what kind of slas

453
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
are enforced and what

454
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,359
security tools need to be implemented to

455
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
mitigate those attacks

456
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,319
but the point is that these

457
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,799
methodologies are focused on building

458
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
an uh information

459
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,359
security center

460
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,240
uh

461
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
all the five functions in our case we're

462
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
talking about security operation center

463
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
and all this

464
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
chain

465
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,280
leads us to risks

466
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,679
to kpis to scenarios and to slas so how

467
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
different scenarios how fast

468
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,160
you need to respond to them and respond

469
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,480
enrich and work with them so this is the

470
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
approach

471
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,679
from

472
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,559
based on risks

473
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,679
you

474
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,200
shouldn't forget

475
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,039
the fact that unfortunately i will never

476
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
be able to see to achieve a 100 of

477
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,679
effectiveness there's always the

478
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,360
residual risk and one of the solutions

479
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,080
is to get it insured uh they're talking

480
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,919
about this quite a lot you can do that

481
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,160
you can try it and what's the point

482
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
you implement a lot of mitigating

483
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,360
measures they already minimize the risk

484
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,039
and this residual risk uh remained not

485
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,039
to be too large and companies who

486
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,720
provide the service look

487
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,559
at what has been implemented how it's

488
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,039
been implemented and they

489
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,600
work with a lower

490
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
insurance sum

491
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,480
and which makes this thing

492
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,679
of interest to the customer

493
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
either

494
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
how you should approach

495
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
and how you uh

496
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
how you can avoid typical mistakes

497
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
so the first

498
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,080
thing is feasibility study

499
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
feasibility studies

500
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,880
happen everywhere not for soc but also

501
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
for other systems and firewalls so

502
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,760
what's important take into account here

503
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,960
you need to combine technical analysis

504
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
so it's not

505
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,679
just questionnaires or

506
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
interviews you should technically and

507
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
systems that the customers using have

508
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
expertise to do that and see how things

509
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
are set up

510
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,919
so what soc related capabilities are

511
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,710
already there

512
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,039
[Music]

513
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,760
you should also you have one on one

514
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,280
interviews with customers business

515
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,799
because

516
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,760
you can

517
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
learn a lot of information

518
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
just an example

519
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
let's say with the industrial control

520
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
system when

521
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,440
we attach uh industrial systems to soc

522
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,880
those who've done that know that there

523
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
are a lot of difficulties there the

524
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
thing is that the systems are not always

525
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,880
so modern in terms of information

526
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
security it's very difficult to collect

527
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,679
the required events from them

528
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,559
if

529
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,360
they

530
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,559
exist

531
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,799
they don't have enough information

532
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,679
and

533
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
there's the general problem of

534
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
installing anything

535
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,880
into and operating uh

536
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
environment and in order to understand

537
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,960
how the soc

538
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,240
now will work

539
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,919
we offering an opportunity to

540
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,000
roll out to deploy uh the systems that

541
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,159
the customer has on our

542
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,000
test beds

543
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,919
including plc or scatter systems

544
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
and understand

545
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,679
what logging capabilities

546
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,039
exist how they can be set up and then

547
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,400
you can come back to the customer

548
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,480
showing them the solution that's already

549
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,159
been tested in this case

550
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
we

551
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,840
give a detailed presentation of

552
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,880
the

553
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
function of these socs function

554
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,840
that you can provide the next point cm

555
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,559
content manually many of you many people

556
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,520
understand it as a rule president's rule

557
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
that exists in the cm system uh in

558
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,080
actual fact it's not exactly this way

559
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,440
content consists of a lot of uh diverse

560
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
information uh some list exclusion lists

561
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,039
for instance

562
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,159
uh used in by the correlation rules so

563
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,600
that each students

564
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,799
should

565
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,799
work out and the analysts could work

566
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,840
with them

567
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,960
these are connectors normalization rules

568
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,039
enrichment

569
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,200
mechanisms and finally these are mockup

570
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
files

571
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
for the dashboards

572
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,120
for the analysts to see the information

573
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
so the process of implementing or

574
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,200
passing some content to the customer is

575
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
not as simple as it would seem you

576
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,760
shouldn't approach it as project ftd so

577
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
you've implemented cm you've implemented

578
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,840
the content and so please do a customer

579
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
use it unfortunately it doesn't work you

580
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
need to do three things in parallel

581
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
first to develop a process

582
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
so that the people who are going to work

583
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,039
with the internet should understand how

584
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,039
they work

585
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
to understand the output the outcome and

586
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
could affect

587
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,320
uh

588
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
affect the work through the exclusions

589
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
and secondly

590
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,679
it's the third line of work so the cm

591
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
engineers could understand the structure

592
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,440
of this content and could

593
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
develop enrich it and modify it through

594
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,720
their own efforts and the third

595
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,400
item is

596
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
training you need to train the teams not

597
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
only just train but also to do the

598
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
evangelization as we call it when we

599
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,000
need uh to

600
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,200
explain to the customer why uh the

601
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,840
structure is like this why it works like

602
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
this and why is it correct so that they

603
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,159
could

604
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,760
get inspired by that and could work with

605
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,880
that

606
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,360
so on the outputs you have the project

607
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
and specialists who can maintain

608
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
and develop it further and finally the

609
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,880
third point say incidence response is

610
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
called so-called playbooks what is this

611
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
it's a certain algorithm with

612
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,320
uh response responsibility areas with a

613
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,960
slash and a

614
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,039
flowchart of how the response team of

615
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,320
the soc inserts are going to work with

616
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,159
an incident should it happen

617
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,400
and so there's a subtle point here

618
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
usually when a

619
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
nsoc is implemented the number of rules

620
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
is measured is in

621
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
dozens

622
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,120
and

623
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
maybe even hundreds

624
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,200
so to develop a playbook

625
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,320
and to maintain it in a workable

626
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
condition after the implementation is

627
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
not the simplest of the task

628
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,320
so as a solution

629
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,799
for such large projects uh to use a

630
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,480
catalog of atomic rules

631
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,720
in the playbook

632
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,799
they're often used the same between

633
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,080
different playbooks and of course the

634
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,240
consultant methodologies takes a lot of

635
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,960
it takes a lot of time to

636
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
draw it up for each

637
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,679
uh process so the catalog of such atomic

638
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,360
rules allow

639
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,039
the allows people to refer uh to uh the

640
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,640
uh common uh things uh so if you want to

641
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
change something you do it in the

642
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,720
catalog rather in your specific process

643
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,840
so it

644
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,880
applies both to a manual

645
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,279
response definition and

646
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,960
automated

647
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,640
approach in the automated approach to

648
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
this catalogue

649
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,520
approach is very useful

650
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
and the output

651
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,600
we are getting a reduction of costs both

652
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
in the implementation and in the

653
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
maintenance of this playbook said

654
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,799
further on

655
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,039
conclusions first

656
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,400
uh please bear in mind those

657
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
inadmissible events

658
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
uh match the soc

659
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,760
structure to them and to the risk

660
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
analysis results second

661
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
consider all stages of building an soc

662
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
not just a cm and hiring look at the

663
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,960
picture broader

664
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
support

665
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
interaction between teams

666
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
at the implementation

667
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,279
phase

668
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,000
so if you would do it differently with

669
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,480
i.t people with uh manufacturing

670
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
engineering and others

671
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
they all should be inspired by this um

672
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,559
common idea and work together

673
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
it's not a trivial thing to do but you

674
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,080
need to strive for that because

675
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
otherwise

676
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,039
if you if all of you

677
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,320
does something

678
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,440
separately

679
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,279
you'll have to deal over the resistance

680
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
from your colleagues same thing about

681
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
consultants

682
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
the more

683
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
personal face-to-face communication

684
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,559
the more you can learn that was number

685
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,760
three and finally number four

686
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,080
work with reliable partners because

687
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
there are pitfalls

688
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,279
everywhere

689
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
and

690
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,880
so

691
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,200
choose reliable partners

692
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
