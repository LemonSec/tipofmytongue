1
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,480
we gathered to talk about a tectonic

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,840
shift in the russian cyber security if

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
any what happened

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,400
uh in the last three to four months and

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
what expects us in the future let me

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,480
introduce

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,519
our

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,920
panelists

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,040
vladimir benkin

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,519
from the ministry of digital

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,039
transformation vladimir grukov

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,760
from ross telecom solar and sergey

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,719
levite

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
from zber

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
i am alex

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
novikov from positive technologies so if

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,000
we look back into the past into the last

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
three months

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,399
the number of days

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,280
when

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
our monitoring team

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,159
and incident

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,840
reaction team was

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,320
idling it goes down to zero we had a lot

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,200
of work no idling at all the number of

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
incidents grew up by at least three

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,680
times

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
and many of the incidents

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
became public

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
i mean they have been actively discussed

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,960
in mass media

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
internet

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
shops

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
government agencies and services were

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
involved

36
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,119
were affected by those attacks

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,040
and they even continue now

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,880
worldwide

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
and in russia in particular

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
if we look at the industries which were

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
attacked most often

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
um i can say

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,840
almost all of them have been attacked

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
any industry is

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
interested to

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,800
hackers if it belongs to russia it is

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,840
attacked

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,879
but if we look at

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
the public

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
area

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
we pay attention to the fact that

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,360
financial industry

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,879
i believe

54
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,760
were

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
least affected

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,319
and

57
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,959
we didn't know of

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,560
we know only about a few

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
large-scale incidents if any at all my

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,800
first question

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
to sergey vasilevich

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
is as follows

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
what about the last three months how

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,200
critical they were to your company or

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,599
were they critical at all

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,480
well

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
actually

68
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,680
we

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
divide our life into before

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,040
february 24 and after february 24th

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
before talking about cyber threats let

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
me talk about fraud first of all it's a

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
traditional problem and

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
area for the banks

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,400
before the events

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,319
you know we got

77
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
about 60

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
000

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
fraud attempts

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
that is

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
100 000 attempts per day after the

82
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,040
events

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
uh

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,720
we had for a week zero fraud calls

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
it looked as if no fraud at all but

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
after the first week after week one

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,159
we have more and more fraud attempts and

88
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
now we have about 50 percent of fraud

89
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,680
level

90
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,280
in comparison to

91
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
the time before

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
february 24 from ukraine fraud moved to

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
other areas other countries it's very

94
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
important for us because we have been

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
talking for a long time

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,720
for a long time because most of the

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
fraud calls

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,720
came used to come from ukraine and

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,919
this is

100
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,199
100

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,960
proven

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
ddos attacks now

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,720
from the view point of organization they

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
are the simplest kind of attacks

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
and

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
we have a very interesting picture

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
before february 24

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,240
we had about one attack per week

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
it was a serious

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
event a serious incident

111
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,360
a lot of services were alerted

112
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
conferences held

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,919
but at a certain point we had about 46

114
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,440
simultaneous ddos attacks coordinated by

115
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,520
different groups using different tools

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,600
and focused on different services of

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
spare bank

118
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,800
and today ddos attack for us is

119
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
something casual

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,479
we are under threat under attack

121
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,120
every minute

122
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
and

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,039
we didn't have such peaks before at all

124
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,639
and we monitor the situation

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
what would i like to stress

126
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,560
to note about ddos attacks first

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
new organizational ways of ddos

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
organization of ddos performance there

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
are groups

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
active groups

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
which

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
are focused against russia

133
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,880
they have

134
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
consists of about

135
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
100 000 people there are moderators who

136
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,240
coordinate their activities targets and

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
tools a few words about tools today

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
we have a lot of tools that coordinators

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
offer

140
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
as containers

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
on resources

142
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
that you can buy

143
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,759
they offer infrastructure

144
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
addresses gateways

145
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,080
to break through

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,199
the perimeter defense you can

147
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
install such generators on android

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
phones

149
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,240
and they can get attempts from the

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,880
command center and take part in the

151
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,720
attacks

152
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
after the completion of our special

153
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,680
military operation i believe

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,840
we shall have a lot of

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,000
uh bought zones that were

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,560
would be forgotten but will continue

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
automatically

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,199
uh generating attacks

159
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,240
one more interesting attack

160
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,880
at a certain moment we saw that a lot of

161
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,280
usual people in their

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,199
home

163
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,840
networks

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
get to our resources were at a very high

165
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,080
speed

166
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,360
we analyzed the situation and we saw

167
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,919
that the multimedia player was broken

168
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,159
that

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,479
legitimate users downloaded

170
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
together with a script

171
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
with resources

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
that

173
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
automatically connect

174
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
to

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
certain services of our bank and

176
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
legitimate users

177
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
who just watched

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,319

they

180
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,680
without knowing about that launched a

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,599
very complex attack

182
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,960
the ddos attacks

183
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
have been learned

184
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
very well but

185
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
all the tools that

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
exist in the world are actually used

187
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,240
for a long time we fix iep addresses

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,760
from which attacks are launched

189
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
so we make snapshots of each and every

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
attack we have a large collection

191
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
before we had five to six types of

192
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
attacks

193
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
now

194
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
almost all the attacks that are in our

195
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,160
textbooks are actually used

rebuffed

at the very early stages

209

because of the perimeter defense that

them best prepared for such attacks and

215
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,680
for most of the financial companies this

216
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,120
is normal as for other companies after

be interesting to hackers

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
any russian company

223
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959

to protect against what are the actual

um

involved the federal level

really huge and massive large scale what

away from the russian market left the

they say ah we broke through that

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
company we blocked access to a certain

329

resources and they publish it

330
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,680
it's a leak about attacks then another

331
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,199
trend

332
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,800
is that behind that background

333
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,040
of ddos attacks which continue

334
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
we see penetration into our resources

capturing resources

and the leaks that uh we have now

339
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
started about two months after the first

340
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,759
attacks

341
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,519
so we might expect serious incidents

342
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,120
of course we cannot expect that the

343
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
leaks are going to stop

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,279
they

345
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,279
try to break through and then publish

346
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,480
information about

347
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
such

348
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
breakthroughs and leaks then on may 9

349
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520

so

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,959
these are the trends

355
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,039
these are the tendencies thank you very

356
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,039
much

357
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,240
yes

358
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,679
apart from large-scale attacks

359
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
we can note another important factor

360
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
which is

361
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
um

362
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
foreign vendors leaving the russian

363
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
market especially cyber security vendors

364
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,919
and some companies russian companies are

365
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,360
were without

366
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,919
protection or with a much worse

367
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,760
protection than before

368
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
and

369
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
now

370
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,240
the russian vendors must take social

371
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,640
responsibility

372
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
to take emergency measures

373
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,520
to help russian companies in this

374
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
situation

375
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
uh

376
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,039
what do you think

377
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,600
about two vladimir's two sergeys it's

378
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
difficult to distinguish between them so

379
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
so what about this factor

380
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
monitoring investigation

381
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,120
and

382
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,039
russian cyber security what will happen

383
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,720
well i tried to imagine

384
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,760
how to describe my current

385
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
activities i have an eight-year-old son

386
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,280
we play chess and i play chess better

387
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
than him

388
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
and when i talk about the classical

389
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,200
uh company that

390
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,880
we protect

391
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,840
we

392
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,799
protect an attacker has a certain

393
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,679
potential but we expect to rebuff all

394
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,000
those attack attacks

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
but then

396
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,679
my

397
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
son says dad look a bird and then he

398
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,600
sneaks my queen

399
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
from the chess board so yes we have all

400
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,440
kind of

401
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,880
firewalls and then

402
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,840
and there is no firewall

403
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
and you have to

404
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,240
play without your queen

405
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
i play simultaneously with 20 to 30

406
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
counterparts

407
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,559
then a company says uh there is a board

408
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,320
i don't have any

409
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,720
pawns any

410
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,120
anything that let's put on our

411
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
figures our pawns on the chessboard

412
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,720
because it's clean i have nothing

413
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
while the enemy has everything

414
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,679
so it's very difficult for me to add

415
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,720
anything

416
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,320
to what i have already said we have

417
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,039
statistics

418
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,720
and

419
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,520
we play simultaneously on several boards

420
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
and the situation at each chessboard is

421
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
different

422
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,000
and

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,559
what does the russian industry do how

424
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,280
does it react let me tell you about my

425
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,559
personal experience

426
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,360
i

427
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
have much more social responsibility now

428
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,960
we have players

429
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,360
that we believed

430
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
to be our competitors

431
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
now we join efforts with them after

432
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,640
february 24th now our key competitors

433
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
are our key partners we work together we

434
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,440
exchange data

435
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,320
we

436
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,600
exchange

437
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,159
information we even say it's your

438
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
customer but i

439
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
have some information about this oh this

440
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,280
is my customer i don't have resources

441
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
can you help me here

442
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,919
and we have a lot of situation like that

443
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,720
each commercial company has a

444
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
big choice

445
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,720
for example if there is an incident at

446
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,200
our customer that information is

447
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,120
important for the industry and for the

448
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
country

449
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,159
because everyone is attacked by the same

450
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,320
people in the same way and it's

451
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
important the information to be spread

452
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,320
to be disseminated

453
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,000
but on the other hand we are a

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,480
commercial company and the customers say

455
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,360
okay

456
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,840
this is our

457
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,720
secret and please don't share this data

458
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,360
to anyone so

459
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,520
each time we try to convince the

460
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,039
customer that he has to

461
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
leak at least part of this information

462
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,760
to all the rest everything which happens

463
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,720
to the russian cyber security is not the

464
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
problem of that particular customer it's

465
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,159
a problem of the entire russian industry

466
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,720
it's involvement of each and every

467
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,280
customer into the general

468
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,600
landscape of social responsibility we

469
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,760
have a lot of negative examples here

470
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
about a year ago

471
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,430
we

472
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,360
[Music]

473
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
found one vulnerability

474
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
[Music]

475
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
at one of the customers

476
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,039
the vulnerability is not a problem at

477
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
all and if we

478
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,799
uh shared the data

479
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,159
severity is

480
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,120
four or

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,919
this vulnerability is known hackers

482
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
cyber criminals know about that

483
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
vulnerability

484
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
what is important here when the

485
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
vulnerability is found disclosed

486
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,919
we have to share that information

487
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
because we have to uh patch our security

488
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
software we have to

489
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
install new

490
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,919
version and i am happy that we have a

491
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,799
news bulletin now that our community

492
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,840
published that bulletin

493
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,039
please

494
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,600
it's very important to read

495
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,320
that bulletin to read all the data and

496
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,960
install patches on the russian

497
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
software especially on widely used

498
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
software and the vendors and providers

499
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
if we have such situations

500
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,559
where in the situation when we together

501
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,600
must

502
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,480
repel the attacks and we must share

503
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,200
information about vulnerabilities and

504
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,520
about ways to close that vulnerability

505
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
not just a release that there are some

506
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,000
patches but tell us about what kind of

507
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
patches against what kind of

508
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
vulnerabilities

509
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,240
so i call on all of you to share

510
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,279
information despite

511
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,799
all the

512
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,520
problems with

513
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
giving your information to your

514
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
competitors we have to protect

515
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,840
us all and not to work only uh at a

516
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,080
local level

517
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
thank you vladimir

518
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,720
it's a very important note

519
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
collaboration and data sharing is what

520
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,840
we badly need now

521
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,959
because we cannot

522
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
cope with all the attacks

523
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
on our own

524
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
we have to work together we have to

525
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,840
collaborate the number of attackers is

526
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,039
much

527
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,159
uh higher than we can imagine and their

528
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
potential is much greater than the

529
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,880
potential of any one individual company

530
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,200
yes we have vulnerabilities it's

531
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
inevitable

532
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
uh it takes time to patch

533
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,918
those vulnerabilities

534
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,679
personal data leaks email leaks go on

535
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,720
each

536
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,600
third

537
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,959
one incident of three

538
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,320
[Music]

539
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
stems from

540
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,559
unpatched software

541
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
because vulnerability was disclosed one

542
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,000
year ago the patch was published 11

543
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
months ago but the customer didn't patch

544
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
the software

545
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,600
as a result an old well-known

546
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
vulnerability

547
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,039
worked and the customers broke

548
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,279
the hackers broke through

549
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,640
talking about may

550
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
let's recall the previous

551
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,880
holiday may 1.

552
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,840
when

553
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
the new normative base for cyber

554
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,840

decree 250

557
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,320
which was

558
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,279
caused by the challengers

559
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
that

560
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,679
the industry faces now that our

561
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,940
companies face now

562
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,400
[Music]

563
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,520
which require

564
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
a lot of things to do in the area of

565
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,479
cyber security vladimir

566
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,149
[Music]

567
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,960
now a lot of companies do not quite

568
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
understand what they have to do which

569
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,840
way to

570
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
move run

571
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
rather please comment

572
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,000
let me try to comment

573
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,799
uh quickly

574
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,679
sergey was quite right to say

575
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,720
uh

576
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,440
to comment about ddos we have a lot of

577
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,600
ddos attacks now for the first time in

578
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,039
this country

579
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,799
we together

580
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,919
coordinate our activities and

581
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,960
try to repel such a tax attacks every

582
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
day using all the tools that are

583
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,159
available to

584
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,799
all the security people cyber security

585
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,240
people of our country that is good ddos

586
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
has some origin

587
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,799
at a certain level and if inside the

588
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,919
country we can work with the hosters

589
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,279
with those who lend the servers

590
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,039
but as for the foreign countries

591
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,440
at a certain point

592
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
the government offered a service

593
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
any company can say

594
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
can you disconnect me from the outer

595
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,799
world and we can do that

596
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
at the border of the russian federation

597
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,520
to help them

598
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,039
with the ddos attack we have smart tools

599
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,559
of this kind

600
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,360
we have a lot of

601
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,799
things that people uh who live abroad

602
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,200
the russians living abroad say

603
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,039
we don't have access to certain

604
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,320
resources maybe you can provide us with

605
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,919
access to the russian territory for us

606
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,960
maybe

607
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,799
the attacks

608
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,640
the attack is already

609
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,480
removed

610
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,840
so we collaborate with the people inside

611
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,559
russia and outside russia

612
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,200
about all the incidents all the

613
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,120
types of attacks

614
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,000
all the attacks

615
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
have been discussed

616
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
before

617
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,559
we had

618
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,520
exercises to deal with such attacks

619
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,320
i would like to say that we were ready

620
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,120
for such a text no exercises uh one

621
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
thing but real life is the other thing i

622
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,799
liked the social responsibility topic

623
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,880
and i would like even to

624
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
tell you more about because social

625
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,279
responsibility of all the vendors

626
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,120
in this country

627
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
i had three dialogues in the last two

628
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,679
weeks

629
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,240
before the holidays and after about

630
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,640
their vulnerabilities

631
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,559
not all of them are

632
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,840
working in the right way

633
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,880
because the russian software is under

634
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,559
the microscope

635
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,640
and it's very important here that

636
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,880
russian developers uh should take a lot

637
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
of responsibility uh with regard to

638
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
their products

639
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,399
the role of interest to the people and

640
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,480
correspondingly if a critical

641
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
vulnerability has been found

642
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
you shouldn't stay quiet you shouldn't

643
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,559
be afraid of something of being punished

644
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,279
but

645
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,559
on the contrary

646
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,320
being socially responsible you should

647
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
run fast and say this is at least it

648
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
happened and everybody has to update

649
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
to get updated on the other hand all

650
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
customers have the responsibility so

651
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
what is this decree all about

652
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,559
if in the past there have been some

653
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
requirements they're still there today

654
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,559
and you must comply

655
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
if for instance

656
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,880
you are a geo-informational system or

657
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,559
you're part of the critical information

658
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,919
infrastructure

659
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,440
so the responsibility for the

660
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
information infrastructure the

661
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,919
responsibility for not having any

662
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
incidents so the decree is all about

663
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,000
that he's talking about the large scope

664
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,240
of organization not only in the

665
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,679
government and

666
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,760
huge companies in the country and a lot

667
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,399
of other organizations

668
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,840
there were a lot of questions about

669
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,039
who coined the phrase about the critical

670
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,960
infrastructure

671
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,799
this phrase applies to legal entities

672
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,640
that have

673
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
critical infrastructure sites

674
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
all the rest

675
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
they also have this degree applied to

676
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,720
them so decree is all about

677
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
today

678
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
the information security is in the focus

679
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,320
of attention of the country's leadership

680
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,840
and

681
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,720
that the head of an organization carries

682
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
personal responsibility for the

683
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
implications

684
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
that may happened as a result of an

685
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,159
attack

686
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,399
then the decree says that

687
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,480
there should be a person and a division

688
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,720
in the organization

689
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,679
belonging to the leadership team uh one

690
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,480
of the deputies of the chief executive

691
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,880
officers so responsible for information

692
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,919
security and again it's not the

693
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,159
responsibility uh for compliance

694
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,760
this happens quite often people come to

695
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,120
us i've done

696
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
everything i've counted all the critical

697
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
infrastructure sites i

698
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
have ticked all the boxes we all know

699
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,279
how you can

700
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,919
meet the requirements you could do it

701
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,039
formally

702
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,559
so but

703
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,880
it looks that as of the 24th of february

704
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,919
this is going to go away so the

705
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
requirements

706
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,279
are to be regarded as basic hygiene so

707
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,760
you have to first provide that hygiene

708
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,000
and then take a look at what next has to

709
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,720
be

710
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,679
protected especially if you're a major

711
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,679
government corporation or

712
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,000
you're a strategic company so on and so

713
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,960
forth

714
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,279
because now

715
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,799
the

716
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,480
chief executive officer of the

717
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,120
organization carries

718
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,000
direct responsibility for incidents

719
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
rather than just for compliance

720
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,440
also

721
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,880
we have to understand that

722
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,600
numbers of information security

723
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,000
experts and specialists professionals

724
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
is very low in this country

725
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,039
so there's a huge

726
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,600
hunger in the organization for such

727
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,720
employees

728
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,200
that's why the decree says directly that

729
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
you must

730
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,919
attract

731
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,480
if needed

732
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,559
specialized organizations

733
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,480
so they should help you

734
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,519
provide information security

735
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,840
there are a lot of

736
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,679
questions regarding the facts

737
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,399
or just to the tune of where can we

738
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,880
get the funds

739
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
because this costs money

740
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,760
and here

741
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,200
we

742
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,679
will be able to help you in

743
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,279
only

744
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,200
the following if an organization or a

745
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,159
business

746
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
for instance if it's about business it's

747
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,000
about commerce if the company has

748
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,480
funds for i.t

749
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
then they need to find the money for

750
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,120
information security same thing applies

751
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,840
to

752
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
the government organizations

753
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,039
they all

754
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,519
follow the digital transformation

755
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,480
programs and we are now checking all uh

756
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,800
the digital transformation programs

757
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,760
to see

758
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,639
if

759
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,040
the information security is taking good

760
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,960
care of them

761
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,359
we are passing these documents

762
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,199
and looking

763
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,079
if

764
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
they comply with these new requirements

765
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,000
if they address the new risks and

766
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
threats it's important to take a look at

767
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
that there are a lot of questions about

768
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,639
the decree

769
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
because there's a point there according

770
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
to which organization should provide

771
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,839
access for monitoring to the federal

772
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,760
security service

773
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
in certain cases

774
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
and they're asking how and what how is

775
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,280
going to look

776
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,839
uh will the fsb come and

777
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,320
at any point at any time

778
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,040
are they going to install some devices

779
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,000
such

780
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,320
as

781
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
to this i can say that now

782
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,920
within fsb uh the following procedure is

783
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,240
being drafted and in the uh shortest

784
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,280
time it is going to be published

785
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,839
an important point one of the last ones

786
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,040
is about

787
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
import substitution

788
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,760
because

789
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,400
it's a separate thread that

790
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,079
actually we have been talking since 2014

791
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,920
and everybody was aware of that

792
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,240
everybody was aware of the fact that

793
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,800
purchasing uh foreign products

794
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,119
doesn't only give you new opportunities

795
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,119
but also poses risks

796
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,560
and for all these years we've been

797
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,119
trying to push the market to import

798
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,359
substitution and if you take a look at

799
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,200
all the questions related to uh

800
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,720
regulation and

801
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,920
uh substitution uh it was all along the

802
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,560
lines of please substitute uh if you can

803
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,599
and this

804
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,960
the decree

805
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,480
has a much more stringent language

806
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
and it was done in purpose because over

807
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,839
the past few years

808
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,240
we were having business coming to one uh

809
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
from one side the commerce that didn't

810
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,560
do information security saying we fully

811
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
depend on software following software

812
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
and we don't have uh russian uh

813
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,720
counterparts on the other hand uh there

814
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,880
are companies who say we've produced

815
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,920
everything

816
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
you just make push the customers to

817
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,119
migrate our products so the decree says

818
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,440
so we all have two and a half years uh

819
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,839
to migrate uh

820
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,320
security to domestic products

821
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,560
and now in the ministry of digital

822
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,839
development uh we're doing a lot of

823
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,119
work where the

824
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,240
market the industry is coming to us

825
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,400
saying what they can't get replaced

826
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,480
substituted for instance so we have this

827
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
information security tool and if it goes

828
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,359
away tomorrow my security goal goes down

829
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,440
and i can't find any

830
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
local products that could substitute

831
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,000
that and in that case in these cases we

832
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
start working together

833
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,640
working together with

834
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,599
vendors and government corporations this

835
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,320
is the story that we're prepared uh to

836
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,560
push together with you so please don't

837
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,280
keep silent tell us what you need us to

838
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
do for you

839
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,960
coming back to social responsibility

840
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,920
it has to be borne by everyone and the

841
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,960
story about the leakage of personal data

842
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
that's been happening is unacceptable

843
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,280
everybody has to understand this

844
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,079
we all know we know everything we see

845
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,440
everything and when you say that we have

846
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,359
a suspicion

847
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,000
about a leakage of health data or

848
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,599
something like that

849
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,359
this is not going to stay without

850
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,640
attention

851
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
this

852
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,160
is something that we are approaching

853
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
very seriously now and

854
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,839
it won't stop with some fines

855
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,760
or reprimands

856
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
but before

857
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,359
we start discussing uh what punishments

858
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,640
are going to be introduced tomorrow the

859
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,320
day after tomorrow how we're going to

860
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,800
punish people for these things

861
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,000
today it's more like a plea to everyone

862
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,079
uh to

863
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,599
perform to

864
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,000
show this social responsibility because

865
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,119
in the past

866
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,680
there was we didn't have to deal with

867
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,960
such a large scale of personal data

868
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,119
leakage

869
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,119
you know the criminal

870
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,480
community had problems selling the data

871
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
to monetize this data it was a

872
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,040
complicated process but today the

873
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,760
purposes are different today a lot of

874
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,839
many factors don't have the purpose of

875
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,240
monetization they've already monetized

876
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,839
they've been paid

877
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,440
money for

878
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,320
just

879
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,599
you know playing in this playground

880
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,119
which is

881
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,240
the whole

882
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,200
civil

883
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
infrastructure of this country so yes i

884
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,760
like this term social responsibility

885
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,520
i would like to say a couple of words

886
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,880
about leakages because the audience is

887
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,640
quite diverse people are

888
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
tuned listening to us online you know

889
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
every morning starts my every morning

890
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
starts like this one of my customers

891
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,400
calls me and says

892
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,000
strengthen

893
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
security and i say what happened

894
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,079
according to the secret information

895
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,560
today there will be an unprecedented

896
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,680
attack

897
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,280
on the russian territory okay i say and

898
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
what uh information are you talking

899
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,960
about where did you come

900
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
where does it come from uh we seem to be

901
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,160
communicating with regulators it's from

902
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,760
a secret telegram channels of ukrainian

903
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,280
hackers

904
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,599
you know everybody's listening those

905
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,720
hackers

906
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,160
channels

907
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
i think my mom is already is also signed

908
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,400
to

909
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,640
telegram channels i'm sure she has

910
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,160
telegram on her phone

911
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
and then vladimir

912
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
says something important that indeed

913
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,599
there are more leakages of that

914
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,680
happening but what's important well it's

915
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,040
my own personal opinion but i'm sure

916
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,800
that you'll all agree with that in the

917
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,119
information war

918
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,440
the leakages come

919
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,119
to be

920
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,000
much

921
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
larger in scale but in the past

922
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,640
what you had to do in uh what you could

923
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,920
find in telegram channels uh it was like

924
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,480
90 percent that were fakes and now it's

925
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
95 tonight 97

926
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
so of the 50

927
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,680
announced leakages only two will

928
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,599
be realized

929
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,480
so it's much more often

930
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,720
that male factors

931
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,440
don't get anything confidential but just

932
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,760
push this agenda

933
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
so as

934
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,720
to

935
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,160
affect people's minds

936
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
i thought you would say

937
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,200
that you already have a habit of opening

938
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,520
the internet every morning and take a

939
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,400
look

940
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,440
what new uh things have become known

941
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,200
about you

942
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
so knowing

943
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
how much

944
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,960
food you have ordered over the past year

945
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,319
and so it's things like that

946
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,160
you know uh the story with uh yandex her

947
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,280
leakage

948
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,160
has

949
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,119
been

950
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,839
talked about a lot

951
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,359
started to build uh rankings we have an

952
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,920
office in nikitsuki and there are a lot

953
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,440
of great

954
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,920
places there too

955
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,760
and then people ask

956
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
how come you spent a sixty thousand

957
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,560
rubles a year uh going out

958
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,119
so actually uh you can find

959
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,680
a lot of ways uh you know getting fun uh

960
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,079
with the leaked information but on a

961
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,319
serious note drawing the results uh

962
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,440
what's happening in the information

963
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,400
space right now we have found ourselves

964
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,119
in

965
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,359
uh

966
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,119
in a fight with a lot of hackers

967
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,480
and all the risks that have been

968
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,040
discussed for many years have started to

969
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,599
become real

970
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
at some point in time a shift happened

971
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,960
in terms of understanding

972
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,920
how

973
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,960
the

974
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,760
international security vendors behave

975
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,319
and the government directly

976
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
started to require

977
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,480
through a disorder

978
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,920
to

979
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,040
get the social responsibility

980
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,359
considered more seriously

981
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,280
by the actors

982
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
it wouldn't be bad to understand

983
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,839
what

984
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
else must happen

985
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
[Music]

986
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,920
so that

987
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,200
let me be blunt we as

988
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,599
uh security people should stay without

989
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,359
work or

990
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,200
might did not happen

991
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,720
at all ever

992
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,240
so are there any prerequisites

993
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,960
for

994
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,079
this to happen or no

995
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,200
or we need some more time to work in

996
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,359
these questions i suggest that we start

997
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,520
with vladimir

998
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,200
well maybe uh there's something we're

999
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
missing

1000
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
something that

1001
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,119
we need to do for this shift to happen

1002
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,240
well the decree had another point

1003
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,960
it was devoted to the analysis of

1004
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,520
security or protectedness something that

1005
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,599
people have to

1006
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,520
pay attention to there are two sub

1007
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,000
points there some items on the one hand

1008
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
the government will

1009
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,839
determine define a list of such

1010
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,800
organizations that need to run this

1011
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,599
review of protectedness and then to run

1012
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,960
this analysis

1013
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,800
there are two comments here the

1014
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,960
government will also

1015
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,000
uh

1016
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,839
draft or adopt

1017
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:50,640
the

1018
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,800
typical regulations

1019
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,079
for

1020
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,000
job description uh for the security

1021
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,040
person

1022
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,839
so

1023
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,520
there are a lot of questions here should

1024
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,160
they have a special education uh what

1025
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,720
will their responsibility be and how uh

1026
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,040
these regulations could be applied to

1027
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,359
both large organizations very small ones

1028
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,240
uh

1029
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,880
the uh these regulations will have two

1030
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,839
ideas

1031
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,800
that this head of security

1032
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,040
uh one of the

1033
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,480
second level managers in the

1034
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,119
organization

1035
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,079
they will be responsible they will carry

1036
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,599
full responsibility for everything

1037
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,040
happening

1038
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,720
and therefore they

1039
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,079
would

1040
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,599
have

1041
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,480
all

1042
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,119
the authority

1043
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
as part of business processes and others

1044
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,319
to

1045
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
do what they

1046
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
are supposed to do

1047
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,440
unfortunately today

1048
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,319
the

1049
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,599
security

1050
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,359
is some additional function business is

1051
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,839
going somewhere creating some tools and

1052
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,240
next to them there's a security guy and

1053
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
saying we've created something

1054
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,560
please don't

1055
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,240
do something so that the regulator

1056
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,359
should not complain now it is different

1057
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,240
now

1058
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,440
they have the authority

1059
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,480
to

1060
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,240
become part of all the processes in the

1061
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,400
organization but with this they're also

1062
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,480
responsible for all the incidents that

1063
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,440
are happening

1064
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,400
coming back

1065
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,440
to the security reviews uh they're

1066
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,760
asking us how we're going to do that

1067
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,800
uh is it going to be a classical pen

1068
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
test or something else

1069
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,680
so there's this concept of a level of

1070
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
security and

1071
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,920
there's also separate items saying that

1072
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,240
the uh organizations

1073
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,000
including the list should report to the

1074
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
government

1075
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,319
and

1076
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,520
so questions coming to us uh say

1077
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,560
uh

1078
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,040
say either we should report by saying

1079
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,200
yes and no and then

1080
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
i must say no

1081
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,400
because we're going to read these

1082
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,800
documents

1083
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,960
which will define a typical scope

1084
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,760
so

1085
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,960
classic

1086
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,440
security analysis or review

1087
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,720
and also they will contain a template of

1088
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,920
a report so these reports will be the

1089
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,800
tools

1090
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,760
for us

1091
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,720
to

1092
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,880
make sure the decree is being complied

1093
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,960
with of course this

1094
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,839
includes a lot of responsibility because

1095
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,680
signatures will be listed of the head of

1096
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,800
security the experts who've put together

1097
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,880
this report so that we could see

1098
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,400
who wrote that

1099
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,960
how to do it so such that we should stay

1100
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,119
without work well perhaps

1101
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,880
each of us

1102
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,400
should focus on information security in

1103
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,280
a serious way maybe 20 hours every day

1104
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,480
and

1105
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,960
unless we do that nothing will radically

1106
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,280
change in this country

1107
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,839
thank you

1108
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,240
another any other answers

1109
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,000
look colleagues

1110
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,760
we have two words in the title of our

1111
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,000
today's discussion tectonic shift

1112
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,480
so let me first dwell uh on the word

1113
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,000
shift

1114
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,280
in our opinion the shift has happened

1115
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,000
those who used to

1116
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,640
tell us that we're not interested

1117
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,480
we're not of anybody's interest so we

1118
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,359
have nothing to protect so go away we're

1119
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,599
not going to do that

1120
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,119
no law applies to us

1121
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,000
finally they have come out of their

1122
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,599
comfort zone

1123
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,760
so

1124
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,040
they came out

1125
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,319
from a vacuum uh of a feeling not been

1126
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,559
in of interest to anyone so this shift

1127
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,040
has happened and i think well have a

1128
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,040
cautious

1129
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,280
might say hope

1130
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,000
that more and more they will start

1131
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,520
understanding this against the

1132
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,280
background of what's happening now so

1133
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,880
we're hoping that the shift

1134
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,480
in this area

1135
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,960
coming out of the comfort zone

1136
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,160
and

1137
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,559
starting to address

1138
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,040
and continuously

1139
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,839
work

1140
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,119
on

1141
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,280
information security we're hoping that

1142
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,000
this will become a trend and it will be

1143
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,720
a growing trend so in this

1144
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,000
area a shift has happened

1145
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,520
to vladimir is here we talk about

1146
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,240
collaboration

1147
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,040
let me put it differently it's about

1148
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,559
acting together

1149
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,720
it's something that we have been called

1150
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,119
for calling for for several years and

1151
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,280
now we are hearing that from other uh

1152
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,920
people let's do it together and say it's

1153
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,040
nice

1154
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,760
we like hearing that so finally people

1155
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,000
started to understand uh that this

1156
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,119
should be done to together well somebody

1157
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,400
uh started to

1158
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,599
some people started to feel part of the

1159
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,359
government uh gospel

1160
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,119
programme a

1161
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,559
operational headquarters

1162
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,599
was created

1163
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,000
involving at the leading gosopka centers

1164
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,839
and through this joint work

1165
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,119
we were able to work out a number of

1166
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,559
recommendations

1167
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,559
and to neutralize

1168
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,079
and forestall

1169
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,319
several threats so we also had this

1170
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,359
shift so we hadn't had this experience

1171
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,520
so in organizing such an informal

1172
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,400
structure

1173
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,520
as now to the word tectonic as i said

1174
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,359
some organizations have come out of the

1175
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,559
comfort zone and in this respect this

1176
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,800
indeed is a tectonic shift quite a lot

1177
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
of effort had to be applied i'm hoping

1178
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,599
that this is just going to become a

1179
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,400
trend uh that with this trend uh is

1180
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,720
becoming easier for us to work as to the

1181
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,920
question of whether we're going to stay

1182
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
without work currently

1183
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,240
i can't even

1184
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,200
predict that well predictions are uh not

1185
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,760
uh something uh that

1186
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,640
you are likely uh to be right with i

1187
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,480
would say uh that in the future it would

1188
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,839
be bad

1189
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,160
this uh will mean uh that everybody has

1190
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,559
taken this part of the social

1191
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,520
responsibility uh starting to work 20

1192
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
hours a day on this and

1193
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
but if you look at these past two or

1194
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,040
three months

1195
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,960
that everything that we have been

1196
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,359
talking about all the threats that have

1197
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,920
been realized are not something new

1198
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,359
it's something

1199
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,359
that the organization hadn't done

1200
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,200
anything about it's about enclosed

1201
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,319
vulnerabilities it's about disregard for

1202
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,960
the very basic

1203
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,839
measures it's about not

1204
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,119
wanting to address this i think that

1205
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,800
24th of february

1206
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,040
so the press is this

1207
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,119
is going to be a new world a new reality

1208
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,359
i'm hoping that the 24th of february is

1209
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,400
going to become

1210
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,079
a turning point

1211
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,559
for creating a new information security

1212
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,960
world in russia so people will start

1213
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,079
looking differently working differently

1214
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,480
regarding differently and when i say

1215
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,440
differently i mean compared to those who

1216
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
have not noticed that uh before for us

1217
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,520
it's all like uh usual i agree and just

1218
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,119
to continue

1219
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,559
uh what

1220
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,640
sega said yesterday absolutely

1221
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,599
and i'm hoping that

1222
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,920
within five days everybody will get

1223
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,319
updated complying with every

1224
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,960
recommendation

1225
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,000
and this will be indeed the security the

1226
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,680
real security that every one of us

1227
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,599
should do every day thank you

1228
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,640
great so we now have uh update slas

1229
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,200
great vladimir

1230
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
just a couple of words

1231
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,079
well after the two regulators uh it's

1232
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,599
quite difficult to give any

1233
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,520
recommendations i would rather say

1234
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,800
something different

1235
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,720
with the rate of indigenization that

1236
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,960
ministry of digital development is

1237
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,079
setting and with the growth of interests

1238
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,559
of male factors to our assets i don't

1239
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,680
believe we're going to have a lot of

1240
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,319
time to sleep but staying with work oh

1241
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,800
my god uh i could

1242
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,680
do the programming some code i do coding

1243
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,680
some time ago and i come back to it it's

1244
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,839
not it's paid well

1245
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,280
the colleagues

1246
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,839
we are now in a very historic and

1247
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,240
interesting point of time but in terms

1248
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,520
of cyber security uh especially today is

1249
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,559
a time of cyber heroes most of security

1250
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,720
tools have come from the west and

1251
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,160
they're going away

1252
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,720
most of them are degrading because no

1253
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,119
updates no support is being provided for

1254
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,200
them licenses are not being

1255
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,000
resolved it's a very important question

1256
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,359
we are losing

1257
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,040
uh the source of information about

1258
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,079
threats today for the most part they all

1259
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,760
come from the west

1260
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,559
yes

1261
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,119
of course we also have

1262
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,440
a local company that provides analytics

1263
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,920
but let's be frank in the first

1264
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,960
place

1265
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,920
we were using well-known sources that

1266
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,640
are also gradually closing access to

1267
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,079
russian companies and from the russian

1268
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,000
territory

1269
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,359
it's very good

1270
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,440
that we have videostack

1271
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,200
but

1272
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,000
it's

1273
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,119
obvious

1274
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,400
that

1275
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,640
one need needs to step up

1276
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,599
this threat intelligence

1277
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,839
work to

1278
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,800
strengthen

1279
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,200
it's also a question how it's going to

1280
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,720
happen whether the government will

1281
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,880
control this or the markets

1282
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,680
will lead the way but one of the risks

1283
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,839
of today that

1284
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,680
will provide this effect later it's

1285
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,920
about the degradation of

1286
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,119
uh threat

1287
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,480
intelligence

1288
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,720
solution so a lot of

1289
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,720
a lot has been said here about

1290
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,599
social responsibility it's all good

1291
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,400
but

1292
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,079
it's also a question

1293
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:58,960
that

1294
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,079
this information uh this collaboration

1295
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,200
this social responsibility uh should

1296
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,760
be uh orchestrated i think the

1297
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,400
government should play a role there and

1298
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,720
today

1299
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,240
this is something that's missing in the

1300
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,079
market

1301
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,280
today

1302
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,680
we have got

1303
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,200
from the start of special military

1304
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,839
operation more than 250 unique

1305
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,599
recommendations

1306
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,520
uh that we got from fsb f stack and ross

1307
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,079
com nazar uh this had never happened

1308
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,160
before and it's very great

1309
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,599
colleagues have said that these

1310
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,119
recommendations are quite easy to

1311
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,160
understand that they need to be

1312
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,280
implemented it would be good if this

1313
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,440
kind of work

1314
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,559
should

1315
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,880
have been done earlier

1316
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,920
of course

1317
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,760
we

1318
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,839
are hoping that something

1319
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,119
is going to change this country in terms

1320
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,040
of coordination of this work today we

1321
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,720
have leaders here and they're doing

1322
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,079
great job but we see some unthinking

1323
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:00,920
among them

1324
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,160
[Music]

1325
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,359
so

1326
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,799
considering decree 250 considering all

1327
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,319
the events that are happening we're

1328
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,920
expecting

1329
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,400
a shortage

1330
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,240
of cyber security professionals to the

1331
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,880
tune of 35 000 people today our

1332
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,400
espionage estimate is 20 000 people

1333
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,119
and it's going to be 35 000 tomorrow so

1334
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,440
these are the people that

1335
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,559
should not just be trained but also

1336
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,599
get practical experience working and

1337
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,960
we are still going using the meter

1338
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,960
access go to

1339
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,559
science institute

1340
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,119
because we don't have similar resources

1341
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,640
here in the market it's also a question

1342
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,480
to the market and the regulator when are

1343
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,119
we going to get this entry point where

1344
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
one could get answers uh in terms of a

1345
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,079
methodology

1346
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,400
education

1347
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,119
you risk information we could get that

1348
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,799
and concluding

1349
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,960
my speech i would like to say once again

1350
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,000
that today indeed is a unique time where

1351
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,040
every one of you can become a hero this

1352
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,160
time

1353
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,880
to become part of the cyber security

1354
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,920
textbooks that's being written now

1355
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,319
including people who are represented

1356
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,280
here

1357
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,040
thank you very much i don't know

1358
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,799
regarding the collaboration there's

1359
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,839
national coordination center and i'm

1360
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,520
sure that they have been talking about

1361
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,839
this coordination function

1362
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,440
there are no colleagues

1363
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,040
over the past few years the national

1364
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,960
coordination center has

1365
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,799
conducted and is continuing to conduct a

1366
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,040
lot of work uh to

1367
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,799
inform the market about threats but

1368
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,000
no

1369
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,839
separate

1370
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:50,880
player

1371
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,440
no separate gospel member

1372
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,280
he is

1373
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,559
would not be able to connect and analyze

1374
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,559
all these threats so of each one of you

1375
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,920
who will

1376
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,960
inform us about the this threat tell us

1377
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
how to fight it

1378
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,359
on each one of you depends how this

1379
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,119
knowledge is going to be disseminated

1380
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,760
we're prepared to uh do that and we're

1381
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,240
doing that here now and those of you who

1382
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,160
inform us about the threats

1383
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,960
who

1384
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,359
do not

1385

are contributing and we are prepared to

1389
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,839
do it further but only together we can

1390
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,240
create this system through the personal

1391
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,160
