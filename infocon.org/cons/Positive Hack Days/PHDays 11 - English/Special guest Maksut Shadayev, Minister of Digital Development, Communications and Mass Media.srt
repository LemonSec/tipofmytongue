00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,160
hello everybody maxwell thank you very

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,759
much for coming

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,519
well

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
you are the first minister of

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,639
telecommunications

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,360
who came to us why

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,800
and do we see how the industry

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
that ministry started getting involved

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,760
in informational security so regularly

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,880
why

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,599
why you do that

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,760
well thank you very much for invitation

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,800
and it's the second time i'm here

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,239
i've been two years ago and i see how in

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,239
the course of two years the scale of the

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,800
event has grown which shows the

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
importance of this event and its agenda

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,920
and why the ministry of digital

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
development is involved in it because

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
it's integrally

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
related with implementation of new

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
digital services the more services the

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
new opportunities for our citizens to

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,760
use

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,840
modern

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
possibilities

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,319
the more are the risks and threats and

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
we understand that this is agenda number

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
one for this moment of time

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,439
i understand but what would you

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,360
recommend you know people are watching

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
us these are people who involved in

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
cyber security and many people complain

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,640
that business does not understand these

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,360
but business complaints that they don't

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,799
understand cyber security but what

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
should we tell to top managers to be

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,439
understood so that they would be

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,799
understood so that they would have some

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
common story

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
i have some examples from another

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
industry i'm being asked very often what

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,240
are the properties

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,040
of

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
good digital transformation manager i

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,159
sell well i say well the key property

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,880
the key quality is the ability to

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,759
inspire people for changes

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
so i think that the key quality of the

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,759
main information security guy

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,799
is the

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,119
is to re raise this question about

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,880
informational security to a such level

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
so that he would understand that it's

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
important of course it can influence the

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
business it can influence the future of

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,120
this top manager and we see that

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
all of this

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
all of this brings a lot of threats to

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
our life we see the leakages of data we

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
see how

63
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,879
our services are being doors attacked so

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
all these has become the part of our

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
daily life so i think top managers

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
started understanding that this is their

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
area of responsibility these risks if

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
they are underestimated this can be

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
this can lead to serious damages and we

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,440
work to

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,400
each

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
involve top managers at least big

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
public companies

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
system

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,400
companies that this is important part of

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
their responsibility and there was a

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,760
decree signed by the president according

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
to our initiative together with stack

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
and fsb

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
that there will be a personal

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
responsibility of the top manager and

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,120
there should be a deputy responsible for

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,760
some uh security so there should be a

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
special department which increases our

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,920
status as information security people

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,480
and this is uh caused by the mechanics

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
and by the situation so i think that

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,080
cyber security has a great future and of

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,239
course we should speak in terms which

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,560
are understandable by top managers this

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
is the main advice if it's going to be

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
in the terms of threats reputational

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,519
losses and negative threats any manager

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
will start worrying about it any normal

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
manager

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
so what do you think i've been speaking

97
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
to colleagues

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
and i see

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
industry speaks about you know results

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,200
of their activities for example public

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
services you make this site people use

102
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,040
it everything is tangible and

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,840
understandable you've made a digital

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
document flow and you can see how it

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,439
works or if it doesn't work but cyber

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,959
security

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,799
what a what is the main result

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,959
that can be achieved in this area one

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,439
year passes two years past which

110
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,478
improvements can become tangible

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,440
well this situation is different when

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,759
digital services are working it means

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,400
that cyber security works well because

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,479
there are non-negative consequences no

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
data leakages no nothing is broken

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,199
everything works and functions stably

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
and people don't value this usually

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,680
because they see stability of operations

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
but i think that absence of incidents

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
this is the main indicator of working

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
cyber security

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
the ceo should sleep peacefully

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
and don't be bothered by nightmares say

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,680
and as the minister of digital

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
development we are responsible for

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
public services even though it's being

127
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,759
done by ross silicon but there is a big

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,160
team which launches them and there is a

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,400
special department which provides the

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,759
security but i don't sleep peacefully

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
every time i'm thinking what else can be

132
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
done which risks can be mitigated which

133
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
daily leakages can be stopped which

134
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
breakages could be stopped and prevented

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
and this

136
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,199
this type of unease should be a part of

137
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
every top manager and this is going to

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
be the foundation of the fact that

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
probability of these events will be as

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
low as possible well in positive

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360
technologies we have a goal and

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,479
one of the goals of positive

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
technologies is to sleep peacefully so

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
when i will call the best team which

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,600
knows to how to do this work

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
so i will give them prizes

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
big money

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
but we do it as a commercial company but

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
what do you think about public company

150
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
if they will move in the same direction

151
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,919
like bug bounty break me or not and

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
in the west you know google and all

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,039
other big companies are moving in the

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,240
same direction so what do you think

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
about it i think this is the only

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
opportunity to provide real security

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
you know

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
everything is all right with legal

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
framework we have a lot of requirements

160
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
and they work but in real life we see

161
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,400
that even with formal execution of these

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
requirements real security is not being

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,520
provided

164
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
so paper security everything's all right

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
with it you know all the certificates

166
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,560
are available everything's available but

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
we do understand

168
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
that there's a lot of possibilities of

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
penetration violations

170
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
in function they're not related with

171
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,240
paper

172
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
and the only way to provide real

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,919
security

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,880
is to be constantly in a condition of

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,639
stress to be able to hire specialized

176
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,479
teams try to penetrate

177
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,840
incentivize them financially and this is

178
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
the only successful story i don't see

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
any other stories and what is being done

180
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,240
in big tech these are best practices and

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
of course

182
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
you are state companies it looks a

183
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
little bit innovative but i think there

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
is no other way because documents

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
they can

186
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
keep you in a calmness

187
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
until the moment when a big incident

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,919
happens

189
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,319
it involves big work a lot of work

190
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,800
constant search for vulnerabilities to

191
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,599
specialized teams and you have to pay

192
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,319
good money for this work and only this

193
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
can reduce the probability

194
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,800
it will never go down to zero at least

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
the most obvious holes should be closed

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,879
so we are trying to convince our

197
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,280
colleagues that this is normal practice

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,560
and we have to adopt it

199
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
even though

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
for many of our colleagues

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,639
you know when you penetrate yourself

202
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
when you break yourself it looks like

203
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
something

204
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
are he ambitious

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
but the recent decree

206
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,759
about the control well it's about

207
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
something like that check yourself with

208
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,319
specialized teams and companies yeah and

209
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,840
this is what we're speaking about and

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
this is our octa position this is our

211
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
position of your company and the

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,759
industry and this is our agenda and

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,440
together with the colleagues from our

214
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
competent authorities we try to promote

215
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
it and this is exactly about it

216
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
it should be a hygiene minimum the

217
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
constant work

218
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,679
to search for vulnerabilities

219
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
okay let's see here's a question from

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,560
another area

221
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,599
we see

222
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
noticeable attention of the state of i.t

223
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,640
industry you know benefits discounts and

224
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
one of my friends tells me in the family

225
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,839
i feel sorry that i'm i.t guys oh you're

226
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,360
so lucky you have this and this and this

227
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
and this i'm a chemist and our physicist

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
and they don't have all of these

229
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
benefits

230
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,160
why such big attention to the industry

231
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
i think that digital agenda is not

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,880
limited by one industry it penetrates

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
into all industries including the

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,760
chemical industry as well because we

235
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
cannot avoid it digital technologies

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
have a lot of factors of

237
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
productivity and progress depends on it

238
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
of course we need science

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
applied research is needed by digital

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,399
technology

241
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
gives

242
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
fast effect of

243
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
cost reduction your properties and the

244
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
state understands that this is

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
strategically important asset that

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
russia is lucky

247
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,440
we do have this great industry we have a

248
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,519
lot of champions among national

249
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
companies our own ecosystems many

250
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,040
companies many states cannot boast of

251
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
good developers like ours so our main

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,480
objective is to support it to develop it

253
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,360
and give more dynamics so all these

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,880
benefits we need all of these to make

255
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
russia

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
a comfortable country for it business to

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,399
work with i.t people and this is our

258
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
main objective and it is sense there is

259
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
competition in cyber industry they say

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
well i t guys they have high salaries

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
but they also constantly been helped but

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,920
we are in the international economy we

263
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,519
are part of it and we understand that

264
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,320
rit people they should have stimulus to

265
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
stay here we should give them these

266
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,519
stimulus otherwise

267
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,079
they are very fast to

268
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
find a good place under the sun in

269
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
foreign countries so we're not going to

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
prohibit anything but we should give

271
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,760
them additional stimulation to stay here

272
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
cyber security industry

273
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
also should receive all these benefits

274
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,880
and possibilities so we are going to

275
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,800
provide it you know cyber security is a

276
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
part of our industry so digital

277
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
ministries involved in it so all these

278
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
new benefits provided to them are

279
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
covering all of them

280
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
and we understand we have to protect

281
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
personal information this is also very

282
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
important because everybody who

283
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,800
develop

284
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
means of protection of information

285
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,720
hardware and software they will receive

286
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
our benefits okay

287
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,279
a question from another area

288
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
very often we hear about different

289
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,760
deadlines and i am as a citizen my

290
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,120
personal data i think all of it already

291
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,279
is in the net

292
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
big mad companies they have all this

293
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,640
data about me and i understand that

294
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
these companies

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
they're gonna pay like

296
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
five thousand ten thousand fifty

297
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,480
thousand rubles penalty and for them

298
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
it's not a big penalty and in the world

299
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
they have the

300
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,079
totally different approach to these

301
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,920
penalties is it possible to be done in

302
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,279
russia

303
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,040
and i see no other way in russia because

304
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
for me as business either i should be

305
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
involved in this uh defense and paid 50

306
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
000 ruble sales penalty it's nothing

307
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,959
you believe me

308
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
i completely agree with you

309
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,440
if the state companies and organizations

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
if we can make them yes

311
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,839
and if these requirements are not

312
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
followed it's bad for the top management

313
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
but for the business the main criteria

314
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
is the economy

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,680
so if they need to pay a lot of money to

316
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,399
provide security into pentes bug bounty

317
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,200
defense or you pay a small penalty

318
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
of course businesses build in such a way

319
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
they will pay penalties because they are

320
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
they make economically effective

321
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,079
decisions

322
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,720
because the loyalty of the users it's

323
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,120
not direct economic losses for them so

324
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
ministry of digital communications went

325
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
to the present to

326
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
with a statement that we should come to

327
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
the global practices which exist in

328
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
europe reversed penalties which can be

329
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
tens of millions of dollars and we

330
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,600
understand that if company if business

331
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
will risk this amount it's

332
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
understandable they will invest more in

333
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
their own cyber security i think it's

334
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
going to be a real change in the

335
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,760
industry

336
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
because clients would request not just

337
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
formal compliance they would have a

338
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,720
desire for the data not to leak this

339
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,079
would be totally different requirements

340
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,839
to the suppliers and it would be a very

341
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,680
important moment yes and the second

342
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,399
penalty should be the same magnitude for

343
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,880
example if we

344
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
this culture has just been developed in

345
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
the business and if we will immediately

346
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
introduce these reverse penalties these

347
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
could be a great pressure for them so we

348
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,639
say that repetitive violation should be

349
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
connected to this reverse penalty we

350
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
should give them some time to

351
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
improve their situation president have

352
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,639
supported and the law draft has been

353
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,480
submitted to the parliament

354
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
without these

355
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,839
business

356
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,800
unfortunately will

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,480
be threatened only by ruble

358
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
instead of additional investments into

359
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,920
the iot security well i understand that

360
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
you have very few

361
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,519
very little time i have another question

362
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
what would you recommend to people who

363
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,639
work in this industry

364
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
when you look at it well i would like to

365
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
say that okay guys you always was were

366
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
an important part but right now you're

367
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
at the front ends you're number one and

368
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
starting from the year 20 to 23 it's

369
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
going to be the year of the cyber

370
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
security and i think the companies

371
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
will enter the infrastructure defense

372
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
infrastructure state authorities will be

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,839
actively involved in it uh

374
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,720
public laws will be all around it but we

375
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
expect certain feedback we wait for new

376
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
decisions we expect

377
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,040
new companies

378
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,639
so guys you are not limited by anything

379
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,360
there is a demand and the demand is

380
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
going to grow even more this is our life

381
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,760
that's why

382
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
you are on the front end so take the

383
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
best and develop your business and the

384
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
state is going to help you from this

385
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
point of view by benefits loans support

386
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,279
and market is available so

387
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,199
go forward

388
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
because i believe that our industry

389
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,680
volume boys

390
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
is

391
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,519
not big enough

392
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,600
not big enough to cover the demand so

393
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
you do have a lot of directions to

394
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
invest and develop you're on the front

395
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
end and your salaries are going to grow

396
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,839
especially when there's a lack of

397
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
resources the demand is very high so you

398
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
are on the top position stay on these

399
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
top positions thank you very much thank

400
