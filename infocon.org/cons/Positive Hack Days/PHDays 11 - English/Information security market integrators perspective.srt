what about the last uh six months

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
interesting question well it was very

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
interesting

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,920
in the beginning of the year it was

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
really interesting and promising in our

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
industry of informational security then

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,000
everything has flipped over we uh been

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
in calmness what was so promising that

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
you've been expecting and then you

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
became calm last year it was a record

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,359
yeah for the industry

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,119
big investments were provided then

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,560
projects were interesting and big one

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
not only here but also in other

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
countries and the year have started we

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,320
continue to we wanted to continue this

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,759
way but everything has flipped over

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but i think that it just stopped for two

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
weeks and then it started running 10

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,360
times faster it's an interesting time

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
what is running what is running tell me

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
about the details you've been speaking

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
with vendors today we've been speaking

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,079
with the mssp providers today we've been

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,320
speaking with representatives of the

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
business

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
everybody's telling different stories

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,040
about what is the main direction of

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,840
their life today an integrator i see

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,759
you're the first integrator

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,439
yes

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
we are communicating with all these

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
colleagues constantly and uh

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,600
their trains are moving in different

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
directions as some uh change everything

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,200
into russian and as integrated i'm

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,479
telling you you know about all of these

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
not about the space

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,680
ships but we're speaking about the

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
information security processes and some

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
other people are still waiting being

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
shocked and do nothing they're waiting

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
and trying to understand what they're

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
going to move because western vendors

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,360
are going to come back

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
most are located somewhere in between

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
between these two stories and uh of

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,599
course it's clear that uh stories with

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,480
different wild ddos it was like two days

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,440
and nobody had to be proven anything

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
networking story would be with them if

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
there would be networking equipment

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
available and we did have big problems

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,840
and

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
uh therefore people have to invent some

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,239
things and we would have a mass

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,239
replacements in some other places

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,000
nobody have started doing anything in

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
these stories because there's a first uh

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,080
things in the queue like real security

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
just on front lines

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
network story monitoring these are the

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,959
basic things and who

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
you have more of whose those who are

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
standing those who are running and those

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,640
who don't care well right now i'd like

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,159
to tell you i'm speaking about our

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,519
clients

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,440
this is the whole spectrum from two

84
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
extreme positions from optimism and we

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,040
do nothing to

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
the same optimism but on the other side

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
well if we do everything but right now

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
break destroy and build from the scratch

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
and everybody's in this spectrum have

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
been distributed evenly some of them and

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
are real subsystems and we've been lucky

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,319
informational security is a happy

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
industry

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
because i'm communicating with my team

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
colleagues

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,200
when some enterprise sdg doesn't exist

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
in the market and you do non-existing

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
things in the market but informational

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
security we have a lot of russian uh

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,760
software something has been brought from

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
china israel and somewhere else

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,599
there for

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
a lot of people you know they've changed

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
everything that can be easily replaced

105
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
we have good russian solutions

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
they do have hardware to install it but

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
it's very interesting time it's the time

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,760
of engineers yes where did they take it

109
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,400
from i don't know because we have not

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
been doing that previously we have a new

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
discipline here like in the place of a

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
certain western cm to the same hardware

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
in the course of two nights we can

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
install russian solution

115
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,200
do you remember when we've been small

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,519
we had you know vhs tapes with vhs tapes

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,160
and we had a box from the old movie yeah

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,478
the box from the old movie so we had a

119
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478
extreme period when we could load

120
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
everything with service everything was

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,479
not optimized but right now the old days

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
came back days of the optimization of

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,759
every gigabyte etc that's why yes that's

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
what it is

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,400
some people cannot change it because

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
they don't have hardware some people

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,960
don't

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
want but they are moving this direction

129
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,759
something like that and what is

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,040
interesting honestly speaking some

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
things to me

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,600
you can explain whatever you want to

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
explain but i don't know how to explain

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
it because for example speaking about us

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
in addition to clear services or growing

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
it's easier to buy a service than a

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,880
certain hardware some other replacements

138
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
but we also see consulting strategic

139
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
consulting is growing what is strategic

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
consulting when people are trying

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
to make a certain

142
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
plan for next three five years and

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
they're making right now in this current

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
condition they are planning for the next

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
five years yeah

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
interesting they have very serious

147
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
approach and i thought well at least six

148
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
months should be taken before they will

149
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,479
start doing that

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
but the time have compressed yeah two

151
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,080
weeks look like six months

152
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,320
have you prepared any recommendations

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,600
advisors for your clients uh how should

154
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
they properly rebuild their

155
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,720
informational uh security systems well

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
there were stories with some alternative

157
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
advisors and some other places advices

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,320
to us because uh some people are

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
involved in the exploitations their

160
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
problem it's our problem because our

161
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
engineers are servicing to the equipment

162
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,080
they react to this incidents etc

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
therefore this is not an external

164
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
problem to us we also have to clear what

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is to be done with it and what do you

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
advise in addition to rewriting well i

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
think right now we're not speaking about

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
some quick advices well of course we can

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
give some abstract advice it's a

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,039
separate story however

172
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,319
let's not speak about those who do

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,479
nothing it's not far-fetched the world

174
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
has changed and you have to change your

175
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
story as well

176
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
the bad idea is to try to do everything

177
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
at the same time because we already have

178
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,919
seen several cases when people try to

179
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,680
build new informational security from

180
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,919
scratch and this situation is not about

181
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,080
this

182
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
because there's a lot of attacks right

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,479
now

184
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,280
and you know this rough environment you

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,919
better concentrate on something one well

186
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
it's obvious what should you begin with

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
it's not an expert advice it's a story

188
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,039
about the basic real security employee

189
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,560
protection protection of the networks

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
protection protect your web

191
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,280
and perhaps because it's impossible to

192
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
protect everything simultaneously it's

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,039
all related with monitoring so most

194
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
likely if they will break somewhere then

195
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,479
you have to learn about it and you have

196
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,560
to react to this somehow

197
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
and this is a proper position it's more

198
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
realistic position than just imagining

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
that you can change the system of brand

200
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
mower system and next day if you after

201
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
you will change it and then it will

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
start working it's not so probable so

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
you will immediately have to

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
look at the

205
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
problems for those gateways well more

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
likely this is possible to be done and

207
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,639
by by the way engineers

208
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,199
people with good hands uh are highly

209
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,759
demanded why

210
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
when you have these super poo pro

211
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,960
western solutions uh with 100 billions

212
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
of installations of course out of the

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
box they work much better than our

214
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,199
homemade stories but let's be realistic

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
and in order for all of these to work

216
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
properly and properly supported and

217
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
properly reinforced you need to apply

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
more efforts and there are no direct

219
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
analogies and very often from three

220
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
solutions from open source and also you

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
are touching genes on the side and you

222
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,120
have to collect certain working story

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
and at the same time not doing it in lab

224
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,039
but together with the enterprise and

225
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
it's a totally different environment

226
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,960
it's not a

227
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
so it's lab following the manual

228
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,759
so i think the most important valuable

229
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,599
people are not the top managers and

230
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
salesmen but people who have right hands

231
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
in the right place

232
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,479
and they are involved in informational

233
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
security okay coming back to the import

234
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
substitution there's a question to which

235
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,880
not many people can answer to me only

236
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
vladimir bergen have been speaking with

237
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,519
me about it yeah

238
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,200
yeah he can answer you any question

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
that's right and yes he can he can but i

240
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,440
think that from you i can get this

241
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
expertise just because

242
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
you have a wide understanding from the

243
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
point of view of different means of

244
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
protection did you evaluate the market

245
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
of russian means of protection

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,519
and

247
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,040
how

248
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
is it covering all the demands what is

249
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
missing in our market what are the

250
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
chances that it will come

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
more or less a fast can you tell me

252
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
please how does it look like

253
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
well we did have this objective and

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
we've been working this story and on the

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,600
russian market there are 200 information

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
security solutions and i wouldn't

257
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
believe uh before we started realizing

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
this uh however unfortunately the

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
availability of these solutions

260
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
realistically uh and applying it in the

261
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,399
enterprise there's a big difference

262
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,839
because the

263
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
it's different there's a wonderful

264
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
solution which has no support no

265
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
documentation and it's not a solution

266
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,920
for a big company from for top 10 banks

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
and how did you reduce your list

268
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
significantly

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
well there are areas which are not super

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,080
exotic but they do have holes for

271
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
example everything which is related with

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
the defense and containerization there's

273
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,760
a big problem according to our point of

274
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
view

275
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
knocks

276
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,399
wi-fi protection

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,959
there's also

278
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
there are some problems with buses and

279
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
i'm not calling this list of

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,560
anti-viruses and cms however

281
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
there are solutions which have analogies

282
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
and we have ngfe but objectively

283
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
speaking there is no

284
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,519
in gfb of the global level but uh from

285
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,519
this point of view clients have to find

286
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
some compromises and select from what is

287
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,839
available

288
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
just if it follows the main functions

289
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,560
and there are certain blocks well we are

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
looking with a certain optimism into the

291
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
future and we hope that we're not going

292
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
just to have russian vendors even though

293
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
they will grow and we do see other focus

294
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
is shifting to russia people are

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,839
investing more in r d and in the market

296
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,120
that's why it's going to be a cool

297
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,800
development but i hope that some

298
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
some foreign solutions will stay because

299
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,279
it makes a market healthier it makes a

300
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,640
healthy competition and honestly

301
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,760
speaking

302
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,720
we've been searching we've been looking

303
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
maybe we are so naive when we have

304
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
learned that there is a full industry of

305
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
information security uh companies like

306
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
25 years old or in brazil they have

307
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,640
information in china they have a lot of

308
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
vendors which work on china vietnam and

309
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,000
japan market the size of this market is

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
like half an earth and we could not call

311
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
the name of this we cannot even read it

312
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
because it's hieroglyphic well maybe

313
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
they have adopted it for them it's not

314
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
difficult for them

315
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,720
but it doesn't happen very fast and i

316
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,800
believe that if there's not going to be

317
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
this defensive policy then new

318
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
interesting players will come to our

319
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,560
market and of course undoubtedly

320
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,399
russian players will come to an

321
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,240
absolutely new level from the market

322
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
point of view and their importance etc

323
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
are you looking

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
into new foreign players yes we're

325
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,760
looking this direction but objectively

326
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,959
it's much simpler for us to work with

327
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,800
distributors so that we don't put them

328
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
to the market but just tubers should put

329
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
them to the market and they should work

330
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,480
with the whole market and the uniqueness

331
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,320
uh maybe required it's a very difficult

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
complicated i understand that you're not

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
going to be alone doing it with your own

334
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
hands yes this process

335
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
everybody is looking this direction well

336
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,639
we are looking uh in a direction where

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,320
big problems are available but we see

338
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
that many others are looking this

339
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,320
direction and distributors uh are

340
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
working with chinese already but they

341
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,560
also have obvious problems

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,680
the company might look at russian market

343
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
as interesting one but there are

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
suppliers or subcontractors might not be

345
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
happy because of it and we did have

346
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,399
cases when we have agreed about

347
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
everything and then suddenly they were

348
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
told by chief suppliers if you will go

349
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
to russian we are not going to deliver

350
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
uh chips to you so we still have certain

351
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
risks so russian uh market is much more

352
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
interesting from this point of view but

353
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,320
if you find some gaps you have to close

354
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
those gaps i understand you tell me

355
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
please what do you think how our market

356
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
is going to change in the nearest year

357
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,519
or maybe let's say three years

358
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
well you speak in such categories it has

359
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,279
already changed in three months you just

360
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,040
been telling me that your clients are

361
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
making strategic plans for the five

362
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,600
years

363
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,399
yeah you catch me you catch me on board

364
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
we should speak not about small changes

365
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
like protection of this or that but we

366
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
should speak about the global story one

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,680
trend that i've been speaking about

368
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,839
and i will emphasize it on it once again

369
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,720
i think significant uh importance will

370
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
be given to technical people

371
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,600
and i think in the last 15 years it was

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
changing i'm the old formation person 15

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
years ago however

374
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
everything was changing 15 years ago

375
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,440
information security uh was like sales

376
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
and engineers which provided services to

377
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
what was delivered it was changing

378
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
changing changes changing and right now

379
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
the processes have sped up and cool

380
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
architects cool technical people

381
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,959
hardware people

382
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,680
those people who should replace r d or

383
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
foreign vendors in russian companies and

384
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,600
maybe in some other companies

385
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
there is high demand for those people

386
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
and salaries are growing so the world is

387
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
going to change the most important

388
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
people will be uh the people

389
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
who are cool engineers and this is the

390
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
story from this point of view it's going

391
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,160
to be a global story so i do hope and

392
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
there are certain assumptions for this

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
that we finally

394
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,199
not finally maybe

395
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,639
there was such a trend but we'll

396
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
actively move in the direction of real

397
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,639
security including the level of

398
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,519
regulators because right now

399
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
unfortunately we do see uh those uh

400
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,959
destroyed companies according to papers

401
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,360
these companies look nice and okay but

402
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
in real life they were not really okay

403
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
also another thing i think that another

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
problem have surfaced not many people

405
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
have a lot of experience

406
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
lack of experience is the biggest

407
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
problem so the feeling that i have and

408
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
i've seen inside of our clients when

409
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
they are getting subject to a lot of

410
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,839
those things is that

411
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,279
everybody are kind of lost

412
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
because the person works three years in

413
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,360
the security and this is the second

414
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
serious attack that he uh

415
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
i know where he should come well it's

416
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
understandable

417
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,120
there's the demand there's a supply

418
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,639
they need to come here we need to

419
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
conduct pen tests exercises etc and i do

420
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,800
hope it's going to be a re-evaluation so

421
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
if your security has not been checked

422
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,519
practically it's not security for state

423
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,519
companies for commercial companies and

424
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,160
the main criteria is the experiment and

425
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
not compliance to the checklist and it's

426
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
not just stacked at least best practices

427
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
etc

428
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,279
and this is a cool thing and i believe

429
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,320
that

430
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
i do have feelings

431
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
in the industry and most importantly

432
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,199
outside of the industry top managers who

433
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,720
were able to see that everything was

434
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,639
okay 15 years ago and right now we don't

435
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,079
have side in because of last two weeks

436
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,839
something is not okay

437
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
and perhaps this trend will be viable

438
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
okay thank you very much andrei

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,920
it was interesting i hope you

440
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
dear viewers were also interested
