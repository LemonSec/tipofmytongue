[Music]

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,840
it is the new terminology that recently

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
emerged in the market but it helps us

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,359
understand better the goals of cyber

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
security now let's

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
talk to alexander bill b who is ceo of

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
rosatom digital solutions about the

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
goals and objectives of results oriented

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,399
cyber security

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,760
well it's a pleasure to be here thank

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,280

for the invite it's my first time here

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
and very often you get to hear

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,840
especially in hr management or hr

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,680
consultancy uh it tends to

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,640
speak about engagement or involvement

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
you can sell immediately that everyone

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,520
here is completely engaged everyone here

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
all the integrators the vendors the

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,239
participants and i envy you in a good

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,520
way because um in my company i would

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
love to see the same level of engagement

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,438
of my employees

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,880
well thank you very much for your kind

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,520
words you know that this is our 11th

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
forum and we've been around for a while

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,400
and our objective is to

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
uh showcase uh cyber security to

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
demonstrate which incidents a real

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
statement may face or to explain who

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
hackers and defenders are so it's uh

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
it means very practical they are hacking

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
they are considering scenarios but at

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,960
the same time we see our mission in

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,000
education exactly exactly and also uh

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,240
engagement self management and we will

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
talk about self management there all top

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
management also needs to be engaged

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,840
and uh it needs to be educated about

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
what information security is a result

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,280
oriented

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,759
efficient

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
information security for me

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,000
means mechanism clear mechanism uh to

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
protect your business from undesired

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
events especially under the current

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,159
circumstances the video hosting that

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,038
i mean people have been talking about uh

49
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,120
since last week this is such a huge

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,480
reputation risk and today it's reaching

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,680
a level when every top manager

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,440
not should not just follow a script that

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,319
yeah we've got a script and i'm

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,760
following the script of information

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
security but now as a top manager i need

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
to be engaged myself i need to

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
understand

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,120
uh what uh my innocence are what my

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
unacceptable events are what for me a

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
business unit is uh what does it mean

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
and based on that understanding cyber

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
security should be built engagement of

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
the punishment is key it has a digital

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
transformation it starts also with the

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
top management if you don't leave the

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800
story then it's very difficult to

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
attract others

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
uh to the same narrative it's very

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
difficult to engage others and building

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
a safe and reliable enterprise

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,159
do you understand it correctly that the

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,760
digital transformation

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
has affected almost every single company

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,360
and business

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,159
here

76
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,959
should also be focusing on results uh

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
should also be resolved re untits

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
well totally

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
uh digital transformation what does it

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
mean

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
in essence we all understand

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
is that any

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
digital footprint or any digital trace

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
leads to

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,480
a risk of abuse

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
my voice is

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,799
in my pocket and you can rob me of the

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,840
wallet

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
you can take it from me physically by

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
upon physical force but in the digital

91
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,840
world i understand that i can lose

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,480
access to resources that i'm using uh

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
through other mechanisms so it's

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,879
integral integral part of your digital

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
planning whether you are planning

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
engineering software or industrial

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
software you must always understand how

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,959
you would be controlling

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,760
the

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,080
cyber security

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
and

102
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,159
abbreviating various risks

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,120
speaking about these unacceptable events

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
for ross atom what are they

105
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
technology or

106
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
ros adam digital technologies uh digital

107
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,960
solutions what are these events

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
everything that's related to

109
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,759
our

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,639
employees and their security we have

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
many people working at our extensive

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
network of facilities for you to

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
understand the nuclear industry euros

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
adam that's about 260 000 employees and

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
about 400 facilities

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
it's a big industry

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
we do not call ourselves a segment we're

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
in industry in ourselves

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,720
and

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
in ourselves you know we all understand

121
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
a nuclear icebreaker or a floating

122
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,639
nuclear power plant or a

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,960
stationary power plant if

124
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
anything happens there i mean it's

125
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,559
totally unacceptable

126
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
these facilities cannot stop they cannot

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
be left without power

128
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
and users will also suffer and they are

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
paying money to get stable supply say of

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,199
electricity so it's an uninterrupted i

131
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
mean it's a an integral process a

132
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
process or other processes that should

133
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,759
never stop

134
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
what is the role of cyber security in

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,560
the digital transformation and in

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,479
making the unacceptable impossible

137
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
yeah must

138
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
seville they all wrote good books

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,319
consultants heaps of consultants come

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,600
and tell you uh hey let us analyze your

141
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
current model uh give you a picture of

142
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,479
your target model and you can also get

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,199
from us agile scrum or waterfall or some

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
other methodology that you can follow to

145
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
reach your targets

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
for me digital transformation

147
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
and it's it's not

148
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,120
it's not revolutionary

149
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,080
vision really but uh

150
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
stop top management soft management

151
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
always thinks about p l

152
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,639
if i do this what will be the effects or

153
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
that at the end of the year i can tell

154
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,360
my shareholder here is uh that was our

155
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,600
plan and um

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,440
i outperformed it

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
the real problem is harm security is

158
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
very difficult to

159
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,160
quantify to monetize

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
we know it we cooperate with you often

161
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,680
and every time when we uh reach the

162
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
point in our discussion where we are

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
saying that if i invest one ruble how

164
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
big the payback will be well usually

165
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
it's zero you can't make money with

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
cyber security but you can lose a lot of

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
money with cyber security yeah cyber

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
security can make tomorrow better than

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
today i don't know statistics and it's

170
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
very difficult to sell actually i don't

171
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,759
know statistics let's talk about a car

172
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
you buy a new expensive car or not very

173
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
expensive car really how many people

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
insure

175
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
the car completely how many people would

176
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
buy complete spicy insurance you can pay

177
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
5 million rubles for the car but are you

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,280
willing to risk the car you can insure

179
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
it you can invest the money or you can

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
put the car in a garage and it will stay

181
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
there for for forever but you have

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
already paid for third-party liability

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
insurance and i think that top

184
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
management often thinks in the similar

185
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
way they come and say why do i need to

186
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
invest into heavy and complex products a

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,879
cyber security

188
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,120
software hardware installation pay for

189
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
installation as well

190
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
so it's

191
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,360
for me it's a matter of changing the

192
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
culture for me as cyber security is an

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
integral part of the digital

194
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,680
transformation and digital

195
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
infrastructure but

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
i'd start

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
with the key factors that impact the p

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
and l what's cool to

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
um

200
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
use another example steel and mining in

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
metallurgy the most expensive part of

202
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
the production process is the blast

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
furnace and

204
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
this is the most labor intensive the

205
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,720
most technology intensive and

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
the cost intensive part

207
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,559
if you optimize the operation of a blast

208
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
furnace by

209
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,479
half a percent one percent the business

210
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,679
will feel an immediate effect and using

211
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
these success stories you need to

212
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
persuade the top management that is

213
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,640
worth investing into

214
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
all kinds of digital optimizations

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
including digital or information

216
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,160
security

217
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
so what's the role of information

218
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
security

219
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
in this

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
narrative

221
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
it's an integral part of digital

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
transformation i don't know

223
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,120
when you

224
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
when you uh

225
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
when you look at digital transformation

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
usually you would see several blocks in

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
there like six seven and one of these

228
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
blocks will be

229
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
cyber security is uh a mandatory part

230
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
and what about unacceptable no i mean

231
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,200
cyber is security uh results oriented

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
cyber security maybe i'm

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
already

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
thinking you know ahead of your

235
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
questions but i'm no longer thinking in

236
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,279
terms of classical cyber security that

237
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
we discussed a year ago two years ago

238
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,360
i'm thinking about cyber security 2.0

239
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
results are in subsecurity corporate

240
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
culture must be changed and the top

241
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,279
management must be made aware

242
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
of the results results oriented

243
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
intervention security another example

244
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
for the listeners

245
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
many people especially top management

246
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,080
can say what is esg right everyone knows

247
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
what hge is and every top manager can

248
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
give their explanation of what is you if

249
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
you ask industry 4-0

250
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
anyone will be able to give the

251
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
definition of msp for zero but what

252
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,079
about cybersecurity you can do this kind

253
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,079
of a poll you can go to top management

254
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,240
in any company and

255
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
ask them what is subsecurity 2.0 no one

256
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
will be able to give an answer and it's

257
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
normal i think uh it's natural but it

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,079
must be changed uh thank you very much

259
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
alexander

260
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,440
results-oriented

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,079
esg i mean people understand what it

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
means industry for 4.0 they understand

263
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
what it means but cyber security

264
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
the results uh

265
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,240
oriented cyber security is when cyber

266
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
security is an integral plot an

267
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
inalienable part of

268
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
the digital transformation

269
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
and

270
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
prevents unacceptable events from

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
happening

272
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,079
ensuring the well-being

273
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:58,800
of

274
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
the business

275
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
thank you alexander alexander

276
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
the ceo of saturn digital solutions

277
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,030
thank you

and

286
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,120
we continue our discussion of cyber

287
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
security

288
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,560
and

289
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
more precisely the results oriented

290
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,600
cyber security let's now uh certain two

291
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
banks please welcome ruslan

292
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
head of information security of absolute

293
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,399
bank

294
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
is this correct

295
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,680
yes everything is correct ruslan welcome

296
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
and uh

297
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
what do you think about cyber security

298
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
results are is oriented type of security

299
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
in banking

300
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
what is your perspective

301
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,800
what are unacceptable events for you

302
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,160
well you see julian results

303
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
is relatively

304
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
[Music]

305
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
it applies not only to banks or

306
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
financial organizations

307
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,040
uh what you have to

308
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,800
a understand

309
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,560
does what its business is

310
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,839
and

311
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
banks

312
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,079
mostly are for profit organizations what

313
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,560
is a for-profit organization this

314
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
uh guided and governed by market rules

315
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,199
the market rules are those of demand and

316
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,639
supply results oriented cyber security

317
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
is the one that enables development of a

318
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,599
company or a bank

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
developing

320
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,839
threat models you are being paid

321
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,000
for establishing practical security

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,040
dealing with compliance issues securing

323
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
the bank solving methods of digital

324
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,360
transformation helping build products

325
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,320
with high value added

326
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,800
if cyber security as a component of a

327
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,880
product is too expensive the product

328
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
will not be competitive people will not

329
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
buy it

330
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,680
so results

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,320
results oriented cyber security is the

332
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,120
one

333
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
that helps companies develop

334
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
that helps companies develop competitive

335
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,279
products

336
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,519
and

337
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
that will introduce technologies

338
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
that covers for all these needs with our

339
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
technologies will not be able to

340
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,040
comply with certain requirements

341
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,680
address certain risks and cyber security

342
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,399
will be expensive

343
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,079
the question is is to what a general

344
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,839
it's too vast it's too broad

345
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
i could talk for an hour to achieve this

346
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
question

347
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,160
okay that's good it's it's great that

348
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,759
it's such a

349
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,030
uh such um

350
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,069
[Music]

351
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
such a big

352
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,279
um topic

353
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
uh in the reply that you have just given

354
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
you use the words such as risks and

355
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
technology as far as i understand you

356
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,160
align certain risks with certain

357
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,440
technologies

358
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
uh with which you are covering or

359
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,839
addressing these risks right

360
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
well you see

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
there are different ways

362
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
to measure kpis or slas in the field of

363
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,480
information security there are different

364
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,759
models

365
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,600
we can approach it from the position of

366
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,839
compliance with regulatory requirements

367
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,680
there are goals for banks for instance

368
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,560
the

369
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,639
government all the state standards but

370
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
it's this state standard this cost is

371
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,680
just a set of basic requirements in

372
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
russia we do not have a single

373
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,959
information security standard that would

374
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,120
be adapted to

375
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
commercial organizations the bank is the

376
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,040
market

377
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
it acts in the market so if you comply

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,839
with cost it doesn't mean that you are

379
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,480
secure you are only compliant

380
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
risks okay you can be guided by risks

381
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,720
risk based approach is

382
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,959
an established approach in the market

383
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,320
there are many different standards

384
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
international standards as well

385
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
it's wonderful but

386
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,759
when you enter a modern organization

387
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,120
how do you define its perimeter where is

388
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
it

389
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,079
companies today use

390
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,119
outstaffing distributed teams clouds

391
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,319
where is the perimeter

392
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,839
in terms of

393
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,640
risks infosec will be very expensive

394
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
because risks are everywhere

395
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,799
on all sides

396
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,559
but there are some key risks right that

397
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,960
can't context you that should not exist

398
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
at all

399
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,480
well what should not be

400
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
is disruption of business continuity uh

401
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,360
for failure of infosec

402
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
you see we've got this notion of service

403
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
security

404
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,880
well we've got two we've got

405
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
we've got chief information security

406
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
officer

407
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,559
this that's the director for information

408
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,160
security right

409
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
and i associate it with the itils uh

410
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,880
standard uh an itu is for uh business

411
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
continuity and then there is the cso

412
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
chief security officer this is the

413
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,280
security that is aimed at the continuity

414
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,880
of the bank's assets banks operational

415
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240

416
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,600

417
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,559
commercial secrets reputation etc

418
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,000
so a

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,960
disruption or violation of the

420
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,600
activity

421
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,200
continuity the integrity and

422
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,039
accessibility of these assets will be

423
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,840
considered the key risk factor it's

424
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,919
something that should never happen we

425
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
should prevent it everything else it can

426
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
be

427
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
somehow fixed addressed you know

428
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
matched but

429
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
banks develop products right

430
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,160
a business can call

431
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
and say

432
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,200
i want to work in clouds i need clouds

433
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
but to say that

434
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,919
clouds are big risks

435
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
what is this risk

436
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,750
i need to

437
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,400
[Music]

438
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
make sure that business gets the clouds

439
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,760
that it's once

440
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
a business wants a distributed team

441
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
wonderful i need to ensure that the

442
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,039
business gets a distributed team the

443
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,640
business wants a product i need to be

444
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,559
sure i may make sure that i can give

445
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,720
them a product and that will be the

446
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
result of information security so yes we

447
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,039
operate information assets and we

448
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,400
today

449
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,960
for protection i mean

450
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
well technologies it depends on the

451
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,960
concept

452
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,080
i forget about the period sir

457
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,480
where is the perimeter

it's vague it's fuzzy

[Music]

460
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,240
such a business model we need to stop

461
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,919
thinking in terms of perimeters we need

462
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,440
to start thinking in terms of data

463
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,679
protection so we need technologies

464
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,640
that in such a distributed ecosystem

465
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,880
will protect the data

466
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,640
which technologies are they

467
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,159
how can we build a secure access

468
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400
network access okay we can use network

469
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
access we can use whatever

470
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
but

471
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,039
there are a few vendors now a few

472
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,360
opportunities these days

473
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
well the opportunities are the same i

474
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
think but the number of technologies or

475
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,640
rather

476
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
the number

477
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,120
of the technologies representatives

478
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
is smaller

the

480
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
capability is still out there but it

481
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,000
takes time resources integration do you

482
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
mean to do it yourselves in-house inside

483
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
the bank

484
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,200
well no not necessarily

485
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,559
say

486
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,840
today in the markets

487
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,400
don't have uh access security brokers

488
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,200
right

489
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
as

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,840
brokers they are say part of zero track

491
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
network access i use crm of the alex

492
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
cloud and i need to protect the data

493
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
what is sas i

494
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
control my data and i manage access to

495
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,600
these data

496
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,840
and i i there is nothing else that i can

497
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,000
integrate into the system how do i

498
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
organize access to the data how can i

499
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,360
protect it

500
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,200
i need clouds for security broker cisco

501
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
had it um

502
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
checkpoint had it and then you come to

503
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
the russian market and there aren't any

504
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
analogues

505
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
was at an event where a representative

506
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
of the ministry of telecom was speaking

507
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
and that person said that they

508
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
expect this niche to be filled very soon

509
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,840
and that's how i

510
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,240
interpreted his words we did not talk

511
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
about any specific

512
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
means or products or technologies

513
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
it was a general discussion about what

514
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,159
is still missing

515
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
if the business understands that they

516
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
don't uh have something please let us

517
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
know and then after a while it can

518
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,840
be made available

519
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,039
i tried to build the same paradigm for

520
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
several uh

521
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
for uh we talked to infowatch about that

522
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,799
at that time

523
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,799
that's

524
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,320
we must be guided by the customer's

525
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
vendor needs

526
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
they are our reference points

527
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,600
the under integrator customer vendors

528
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,159
develop products integrators perform

529
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,480
work to integrate

530
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
but what the customers want the

531
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
customers want not to have a problem but

532
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
not to have a

533
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
headache

534
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
the problem or the pain

535
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,039
can be

536
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,679
the same as or it can

537
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
overlap with other products and maybe

538
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
the product that is available doesn't

539
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
remove all of the paint like crm systems

540
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
how many crm systems you have we have

541
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,960
today in the market what is the crm

542
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,360
system in a classical version do we have

543
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,600
a classical crm system probably not

544
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
because the markets do not need any

545
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
classical crm systems today

546
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,799
dioxide you know

547
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,200
data all these classical crm systems are

548
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
no longer with us they were around 20

549
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,520
years ago stay crm is the marketing term

550
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,600
and for some uh crm means

551
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,000
a part of xcr for others it's

552
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,480
something integrated with erp

553
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,120
okay what which which pain should remove

554
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,279
them

555
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
when we respond to incidents we uh use

556
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,360
two concepts cm erp sar and xdr

557
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,158
why their choice

558
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,480
security operations center any response

559
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,640
even through security operations we have

560
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,799
our own security operations center takes

561
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
some time

562
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
for instance

563
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,640
how can you

564
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
avoid a sandbox quickly under certain

565
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,520
conditions

566
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,799
company

567

[Music]

568
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
otherwise archives can be blocked and

569
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,440
the uh

570
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
bank simply will will not get what what

571
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
he or she wants what we do is we take

572
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,720
malware we encrypt it

573
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
we send it

574
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,039
the sandbox doesn't open the archive it

575
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,640
doesn't understand what's in it unless

576
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
it will pass through and if at the

577
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
terminal

578
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
there aren't any

579
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,880
nca or something else something similar

580
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,600
you can send a second message with a

581
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
password

582
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
you follow

583
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
you open the archive the user

584
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
opens the archive the back door is

585
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,200
opened

586
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,840
and

587
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,760
the attacker sees everything that

588
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
happens on the computer of the user

589
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,679
so we um we we do not have any um

590
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
anti-a we close the back door

591
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,400
it was not detected

592
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
it takes time uh for this information to

593
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,679
get ucm to your beat you register an

594
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,400
incident uh for our team to respond it

595
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
takes time it takes five minutes maybe

596
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
ten minutes

597
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,450
and the back door stays open

598
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,509
[Music]

599
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,679
um

600
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,039
so there is another problem protection

601
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,240
of terminals you are talking about

602
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
external right

603
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,720
yes it's the xdi technology what is uh

604
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
protecting the terminals the end

605
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,200
stations in the uh modern world it's not

606
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,919
anti-virus

607
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,840
of the junior level can

608
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,159
hack it but the terminal how can it be

609
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,840
protected you monitor the

610
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,360
workload how to protect workstations

611
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,799
three advice from you three pieces of

612
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,159
advice very clear and short advices

613
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,399
your money toward all of the workloads

614
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,399
on the working station we've got

615
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,000
endpoints for this

616
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,720
the ponyta pasta

617
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,799
remember that there are different

618
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,520
channels right you can

619
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,679
capture it via email but you still have

620
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,279
to monitor it exactly you need to

621
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,279
monitor it xtr if you set it up

622
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,399
correctly

623
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,760
he can

624
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
at least he can respond within the

625
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,320
shortest time possible okay rosanna
