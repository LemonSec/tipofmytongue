1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,240
good day colleagues ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
i'm happy to present to you my

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,760
presentation

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,559
it's

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,280
devoted to self-assessment of absec

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
process maturity

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
my name is ilya sharov and i'm in charge

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
of this exact

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,480
area

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
i've been in

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,760
physical security all kinds of

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,199
sacks and last year i presented

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,640
on priorities of business that uh

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,760
that sometimes are higher than

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
security priorities do you think that

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,840
business priorities are higher than

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
security priorities today

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
or requirements of security

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
share of hands

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
and then you have your why's in your

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
mind right why business priorities seem

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
to be higher than

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
security requirements i expected a

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
different reaction i expected to have

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
a lot of

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,119
hands in the air

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
so

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,240
you can see that a lot of applications

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
80

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,320
of

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,600
respondents

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
respondent organizations

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,000
uh carried out

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
identification of security threats

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
some of them

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,159
mentioned

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,560
that they thought the risk is low others

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
said that we're trying to meet our

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
deadlines

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
but anyhow

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
for

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
security guys it's not the most

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,799
important part

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,439
business priorities are always higher

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,320
than

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
security requirements

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,159
de facto

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,320
so i'm a bit confused not to see all of

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
you raising hands why is that

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
well we are protecting an asset an asset

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
is created by a business unit security

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
is another asset but we're not

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
discussing it today no asset no job for

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,799
us

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,560
right so on to the uh plan of our

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,360
today's presentation we're going to look

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
at various aspects

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
including

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,080
application security

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,080
continuous

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
security provisioning

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
how to carry out self-assessment

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
and i'm going to give you some timeline

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
and i'll give you some

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
tips and

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
information on pitfalls

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
why

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
self-assessment of maturity interactions

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
and processes is important

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
well we all know that

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
say

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,360
testing pen testing well something that

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,640
is clear

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
clear to all of us

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,959
but if we go a bit deeper scratch the

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,879
surface

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,760
it turns out that we have internal pen

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
test and external pen test

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,519
infrastructure pen test and pen tests

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
related to various life cycles of your

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,480
product

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,239
so turns out that pen test is not is is

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
more than just one saying it's

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,480
multifaceted to be quite frank of you

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,800
i'm tired of seeing this kind of models

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,560
in each presentation

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
related to devsecops

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,440
including the presentation related to

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,359
maturity self-assessment

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
in both russian and foreign colleagues

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
of ours

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
just for general understanding

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
what this loop is

94
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
an intuitive model is more than enough

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
here we see continuous testing

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
here we can also see other aspects

97
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
that are required

98
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
to keep the cycle going

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
all the way from design

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
and to

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
operation

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,679
so what we wish to see

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,478
interacting with various experts

104
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,798
i conclude that there are some experts

105
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,400
that

106
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,199
say that i am a deaf ops engineer and i

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,440
know everything

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
so here this reference architecture

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,479
presents to you everything that can be

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
in your pipeline

111
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,560
we as opsec team

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
are interested in points highlighted in

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,240
red

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
unfortunately it's a busy slide and i

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
doubt you can clearly see those red

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,440
points but these are the points

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
that

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520
provide for continuous testing at all

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
stages of ci cd

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
so in the organization you should have a

121
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
model of this kind

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
on of the topic of my presentation how

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
to carry out maturity self-assessment

124
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
there is this uh damning shoehorn

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,360
pdca cycle

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
at one point

127
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
in internal training i wanted to

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
tell everybody about the cycle and i was

129
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
told that it's it's very very obvious

130
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
you don't need to include that but

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
guys

132
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
who knows what pdc pdca cycle is and who

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600
uses pdca cycle in

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
your work okay i could see it right

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,039
three hands or something

136
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,800
great thank you for that

137
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
in order to do

138
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,199
maturity self-assessment you should do

139
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,039
it right right

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,840
plan do check act

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,638
and reiterate

142
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
that's

143
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
so i i probably

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,160
could have stopped there

145
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
but

146
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
i could have done that if each of you

147
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,479
would be

148
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,479
very much into the frameworks and

149
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,520
maturity models and would actually do

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,160
maturity assessment but unfortunately

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,840
this is not the case

152
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,198
our previous speaker

153
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
looks like we're having a bit of delay

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,400
the previous speaker helped me by

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
highlighting this issue

156
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
so let us go deeper into it

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
before dealing with self-assessment you

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
really have to have

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,759
management support management support

160
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
could be on various levels and i always

161
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,360
highlight that in order to move forward

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,039
all you need

163
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,719
is to have at least one

164
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,919
helper or supporter

165
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,280
in my career

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
if i could

167
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
get my idea through to at least one

168
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,680
person this idea moves on

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
here i give various arguments that i

170
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
make use of in my professional

171
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
activities when i talk to experts and

172
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
line managers

173
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
the top management

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
and let me include a caveat here

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
i mean

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
ib i mean business

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
not business security just information

178
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,919
security

179
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,800
um

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
area

181
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
as such are we going to look at best

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,879
practices

183
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,680
as a way of going forward

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,479
security is something that is everybody

185
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
is interested in there are internal and

186
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
external challenges and probably this is

187
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
a way to achieve your development goal

188
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
including performance improving on

189
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,240
performance well here you need to

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
understand that here you only have

191
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,479
bullet points

192
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
each of the bullet points

193
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,039
has its own set of arguments

194
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
and obviously i cannot demonstrate all

195
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
the specifics

196
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,120
within the framework of one

197
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
a short presentation

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
sustainable development industrial

199
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
challenges unique experience

200
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,760
whatever you think top managers

201
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
can also be very supportive of you they

202
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
are global thinkers so

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
the only thing you need is to

204
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
frame it right

205
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,880
and also decreasing regulatory risks and

206
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,440
compliance risks again each has to be

207
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
backed with something specific

208
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
what is it exactly that you can

209
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
provide for

210
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
the right hand

211
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
part of the slide

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,959
is a loop

213
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,480
and not for nothing

214
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
thing is that these sets of arguments go

215
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
up and they go down

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
you really have to

217
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
be knowledgeable want to use this or use

218
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
that

219
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
or both

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,518
sets of arguments

221
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
now that you have support

222
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
in

223
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
promoting your idea of self

224
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,720
maturity self assessment

225
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
at this point you ask yourself do we

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
really need it

227
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,519
these are

228
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
variants of goals and objectives of

229
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
self-assessment

230
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,839
and for each organization it could be

231
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
individual

232
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
it's very variable

233
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
say assess maturity

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
in

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,040
software security a very general

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
goal but this is the way

237
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
we meant it to be or say

238
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,720
identify maturity by directions or give

239
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
general

240
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
a general assessment

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
carry out benchmarking

242
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
i carry out analysis of results

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
because you really need to understand to

244
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,640
analyze your results your data

245
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
you need to bear in mind that at all

246
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
at all points

247
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
you really have to understand

248
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
what are your grounds for carrying out

249
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
this assessment

250
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
are you knowledgeable enough to do this

251
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
assessment

252
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,839
is it well-grounded

253
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
for example

254
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,640
one

255
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
grounding argument

256
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
is that you want to

257
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,720
realize the plan we planned it

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,839
therefore we do it or for

259
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,480
example you're in for an external audit

260
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,880
and you want to get yourself ready for

261
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
it

262
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
you identify

263
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
the necessity you identify your goals

264
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,959
and objectives

265
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
you have the support now you have to get

266
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
ready for it

267
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,399
in order to carry out self-assessment

268
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,040
you can make use of two models

269
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,519
this is either

270
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
obasp sam or

271
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
nothing is there in the market apart

272
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,240
from what i just mentioned

273
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
apart from the ones mentioned by the

274
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,959
previous speaker but they're not really

275
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,120
viable

276
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
i'm not sure what is your background

277
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
uh knowledge and what is the background

278
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
knowledge of those who listen to us

279
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,480
in our broadcast so let me

280
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,560
tell you a few words about sam

281
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,760
this is an objective and measurable way

282
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,240
to analyze and improve on

283
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,800
security of software

284
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
there are five business

285
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,519
cycles three methods in all of them 90

286
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,040
all in all

287
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,320
and this model is built on

288
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,040
upon the experience of the community

289
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
it has certain guidelines and it's

290
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
updated every two years

291
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
a big

292
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
positive factor

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
is that it has guidelines it has tool

294
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
boxes like the one that you have on the

295
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,880
slide

296
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,880
so in order to carry out self-assessment

297
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
you just go ahead and study the relevant

298
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
materials and you

299
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,079
start working on it

300
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,000
so you fill in

301
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
a questionnaire

302
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,279
it would

303
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
return to you

304
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,480
um some values and this this kind of a

305
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,639
spider diagram and thus you'll

306
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
understand in general

307
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,800
what is the maturity level of your

308
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
organization

309
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,040
as far as be seen as concerned the

310
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,639
objective is different

311
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
to help you to analyze to plan

312
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,360
and to organize development

313
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
here we have four domains

314
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
and three practices

315
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
and 122 directions in providing for

316
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,959
security of software

317
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,440
in looking at

318
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
bsim

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,839
i'd like to point out that it has robust

320
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
experience of usage

321
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,680
huge reference space

322
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
you can see a lot of companies are using

323
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,920
this model

324
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,279
and you can use

325
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,800
them

326
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
as a source of expertise

327
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
and experience

328
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
you can also carry out

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
benchmarking of your industry with the

330
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
industry

331
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,360
that makes use of basem

332
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
it's mine in such industries

333
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
we have hundreds of thousands of

334
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,639
developers and

335
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,880
we also have security specialists so

336
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
they all in these communities

337
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,760
so

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,839
this way you look at

339
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,600
model number one you look at model

340
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,880
number two

341
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
and you try and understand which of them

342
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,880
is the one that is relevant and

343
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,000
best to be used by your company

344
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,320
this is exactly the question i

345
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,880
had to ask myself when i had to compare

346
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,720
them compare them theoretically

347
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
the pluses of be

348
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
a sim

349
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,160
is that they have regular annual updates

350
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,720
and real data

351
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,360
an opportunity to compare to particular

352
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,079
industries but the lack of guidelines

353
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
and toolbox

354
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
is a big minus

355
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,760
now the second model of asp

356
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
it has

357
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,079
toolbox

358
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,920
and guides

359
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
but it only updates every two or three

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
years

361
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
and in our reality

362
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
we understand that the information is

363
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
rendered obsolete very fast and updates

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
every two three years is not good enough

365
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,720
it could negatively impact you

366
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
after carrying out the theoretical

367
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
comparison

368
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,680
and after looking at these models

369
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,560
as related to us we wanted to first of

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,638
all

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
reduce

372
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
and we were wrong

373
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,560
in what we wanted to do we wanted to

374
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
start with the theme and then put some

375
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
on top of it

376
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,719
we were wrong

377
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
we have three blocks here

378
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,079
and what we managed to see is this bcm

379
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,120
gives you a clear-cut understanding of

380
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
responsibility

381
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
zones

382
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,199
some

383
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,040
is more general

384
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,079
in

385
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,639
description and even on the third

386
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
in the certain iteration you don't

387
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
really understand what they want from

388
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,000
you

389
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,240
it the same has 122

390
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
directions and sam has 50 practices and

391
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
the different terminology

392
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,320
too

393
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
so quantitatively

394
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,199
your coverage would differ

395
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
when we carried out distribution of

396
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
responsibilities in using bcm and sam

397
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,199
it turned out

398
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,560
that

399
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,638
be

400
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,000
same is accounted for in several sam

401
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
practices

402
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,040
and we cannot carry out

403
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
maturity assessment using this

404
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
um

405
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
this model because it increased our

406
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,559
workload on even on proprietary phase

407
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,240
to say nothing of the evaluation

408
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
assessment

409
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,640
per se

410
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
so we thought

411
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,760
that we are going to stay with bc

412
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,400
right so

413
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
what is the type of self-assessment we

414
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,799
want to make user

415
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,439
is it going to be self-assessment

416
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,919
external assessment when we

417
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,720
ask

418
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,679
audit

419
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
specialists

420
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
some contractors who can carry out this

421
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
job for you

422
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,840
in the right hand part of the slide

423
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
this is from how to in sam

424
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
they split into detailed and light

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
variant we decided to go for light

426
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
variant

427
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,080
and with this on the background

428
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
when you're on the threshold of deciding

429
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
whether to do it on your own or

430
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,120
attracting an external contractor

431
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,600
at this very point you need to account

432
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,400
for

433
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,840
your goals and objectives

434
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
if your goal and objective is just to

435
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
put it in your drawer

436
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
then you can go ahead and hire a

437
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
contractor

438
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,439
what are your expectations

439
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
i'm not opening any secrets here by

440
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
saying that when you pay a million

441
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
rubles

442
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
you oftentimes are not

443
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000
exactly satisfied with the job

444
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,559
it's not that you thought that you know

445
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,440
you have

446
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,840
everything covered

447
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,280
it's just that you may be dissatisfied

448
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
with the job done

449
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
other things that you need to account

450
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,679
for are risks and resources

451
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,960
risks is the word that

452
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
is very important for me so in talking

453
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,480
to managers i mentioned three risks

454
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,760
leakage of confidential information

455
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,559
and people were smiling at me and saying

456
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,840
ah come on there are ethics codes

457
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,400
there are contractual obligations

458
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,200
there are mdas

459
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,520
so i smiled back i voiced my arguments

460
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,480
and i

461
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
now have to ask them okay guys where is

462
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
this

463
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
we can see that it does not necessarily

464
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
safeguard us from anything

465
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
another risk is external

466
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,919
politics risks

467
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
i i could never

468
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,120
even start to imagine how close i would

469
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,799
be to

470
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
the actual reality

471
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,679
but but this is a

472
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,000
risk

473
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,960
and a third type of risk was regulatory

474
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
risk related to the first two

475
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
risks

476
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
and to the fact that in case

477
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
the job is being done using one of

478
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,120
scenarios there is a chance that

479
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
you'll be

480
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,840
asked a lot of unpleasant questions by

481
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,320
uh state security guys

482
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,679
okay so self-assessment it is

483
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,799
simple

484
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
lightweight detailed

485
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,679
simple is when you just fill in some

486
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,200
checklists

487
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
you carry out planning you prepare the

488
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,440
checklist you fill them in you analyze

489
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,960
the results

490
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
and you plan your activities

491
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,159
after it's all over

492
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,520
the

493
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,960
next steps next steps for development

494
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
in order to prepare a checklist

495
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,960
we

496
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
want to be seen

497
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
in each of

498
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,880
its domains

499
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
the cards

500
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
were translated from english into

501
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,240
russian

502
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,320
we identified

503
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,159
the experts who are more knowledgeable

504
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
in the field and so we sat down and

505
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,240
filled in a simple

506
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,120
binary form

507
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,760
and we planned our activities that's it

508
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,440
and you can see that the

509
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
task volume is much higher here

510
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
the prepared checklist is not a

511
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,240
difficult thing to do

512
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,280
additional criteria distribution of

513
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
responsibility zone developing

514
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
questionnaire

515
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,360
and the highlight developing using

516
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
automation and as mentioned by the

517
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
previous speaker you can automate

518
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
anything

519
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
but for

520
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
intellectual activity

521
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
identifying assumptions and constraints

522
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
you are going to see

523
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,840
to have some constraints and you ought

524
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,480
to understand your constraints

525
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
so

526
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,120
these are the preparatory stages

527
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,039
and this is when you need to talk to

528
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,919
your manager

529
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
and to inform all the stakeholders

530
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
carry out the interviews

531
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,120
and then interpret the results right

532
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,159
so what is the difference between

533
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,240
this one and the detailed one in

534
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
detailed one you also have to have proof

535
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,679
of concept

536
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,640
and the so-called technical assessment

537
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,400
by technical assessment

538
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
we mean

539
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
well proof of concept is

540
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
self-explanatory right and

541
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,320
technical uh assessment assessment is

542
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,679
like

543
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
if it's external contractor you need to

544
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,559
show him how it all works

545
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
or you want him to introduce his tools

546
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,440
into you or if it's self-assessment you

547
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,600
need to make sure

548
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
that this practice is being

549
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
used

550
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
i'm part of obsec team and i know all

551
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
these people and i know

552
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,159
the tools and i know

553
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,440
everything

554
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
uh on my side so we decided not to go

555
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,880
for technical assessment

556
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
so

557
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,880
we did some of you know bits and pieces

558
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
of

559
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,840
technical assessment

560
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,960
and the timeline was 16 weeks

561
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,799
not continuous 16 weeks you know 16

562
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,520
weeks running

563
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,559
in the first stage

564
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,120
we initiated and we wanted to gain

565
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
support this is this is what we worked

566
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,918
on

567
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
it took us about two weeks

568
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,840
and then

569
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
we went on to simple self-assessment

570
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,760
using checklist you remember

571
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,559
and it only took a week

572
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,200
and then another week to plan for next

573
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,840
steps

574
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,240
what followed

575
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
was communicating to

576
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,640
contractors capable of providing the

577
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
service so that they can carry out

578
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,720
maturity assessment

579
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,600
so we would get commercial offers

580
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,279
we would tell them

581
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,440
how we have already carried out this

582
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,720
assessment and at one of those meetings

583
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
my colleagues

584
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,200
laughed in our face

585
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
they said okay here we are we have

586
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,919
maturity self-assessment

587
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
uh finalized

588
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,360
and we can

589
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,520
we have something to share

590
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,159
when we realize that we're not going to

591
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,120
ask any contractors to join us on it

592
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
we

593
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,720
got back

594
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,600
we were getting ourselves ready for the

595
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
lightweight self-assessment

596
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,400
and onto stage three that i detailed

597
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,720
earlier

598
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
and after we did that

599
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,720
within one week

600
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
we coordinated the final results

601
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,679
and got approvals

602
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,600
it's it's it's not like

603
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,840
people say telling us that please write

604
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
that everything is all right

605
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,679
with us

606
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,480
it was not like that

607
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,840
we were giving our information to

608
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,559
various management levels after we

609
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,520
finalized this cycle

610
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
we went on to do short-term and

611
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
long-term planning

612
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,679
and initiated our work on

613
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,080
assessing results of our self-assessment

614
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,360
and it took another two weeks

615
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,240
currently

616
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
we are going to

617
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,480
go on with pdca and we're going to

618
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,720
reiterate

619
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
so these are results of a

620
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,559
self-assessment

621
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,678
hopefully you can see it

622
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,440
so what's the conclusion

623
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,320
some kind of report

624
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
you get a benchmark against other

625
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,279
players in the market

626
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
reference information

627
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,480
on general level of security

628
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
and also the questionnaire

629
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,720
filled in and processed but in order to

630
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,799
draw conclusions you'll have to go

631
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,720
bottom to top

632
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
so first you work with the

633
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
questionnaires and you identify the

634
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,559
positive and the negative aspects and

635
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,799
when everything is ready

636
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,880
then and only then

637
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,039
you

638
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
make a reference

639
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,880
document on the state of opsec in the

640
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,240
organization

641
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
[Music]

642
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
and again you need to

643
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,600
you will need to go through all the

644
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,600
stages

645
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,039
you need to be frank about what

646
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,159
happened if your objective was to carry

647
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
out self-assessment just for

648
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
the sake of sex self-assessment

649
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,919
it's it's it's not just the thing that

650
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:52,799
i'm

651
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,120
talking about

652
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,720
we decided to carry out audit

653
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
so we made

654
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,679
an audit report

655
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,120
so it was conclusion

656
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
data and infographics and

657
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
recommendations in conclusion we had

658
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,919
opinion

659
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,640
uh sections

660
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,039
assumptions objectives

661
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,799
not all the people

662
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,799
reading it are going to be knowledgeable

663
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,640
about what bissem is

664
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,960
so you need to explain what it is

665
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,320
you give

666
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,679
processed statistics of responses

667
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,279
recommendations are split into three

668
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,760
blocks recommendation on major flaws

669
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,399
recommendations on most popular

670
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,120
basin areas or directions

671
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,799
and also recommendations on

672
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,720
non-core

673
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,760
floors what are core or main

674
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,279
flaws

675
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,919
we came up with six

676
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,399
such flaws you would think six floors

677
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,240
six recommendations no it's not like

678
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,840
that

679
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
we gave 18 recommendations for six

680
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
floors one two three

681
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,799
one two three per each of the floors

682
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,360
at that

683
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
the number the number of recommendations

684
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,679
even increased

685
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,960
so basically you have to

686
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
you have to follow a certain system in

687
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,480
describing

688
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,279
the main flaws

689
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,399
[Music]

690
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,559
what are the challenges

691
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,600
well

692
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,960
at the minimum

693
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,840
lack of materials

694
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,559
i really wish i had some of the slides

695
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,880
that i demonstrated to you today before

696
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,840
i embarked on that

697
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
job

698
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
the necessity to create toolbox and

699
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
questionnaire

700
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,279
on the basis of some but for the same

701
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,200
correct interpretation and adaptation

702
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
because our security community is

703
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
different from the english one we take

704
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,399
up a lot of their terminologies but

705
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,840
the models still

706
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,559
differ terminology differs and sometimes

707
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
it is very difficult to understand what

708
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,799
it what is it that they are trying to

709
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,760
say

710
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,159
distribution of responsibility is not a

711
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,279
simple task at all

712
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,360
when carrying out assessment you need to

713
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,399
uh

714
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,440
to to see to it that you have it

715
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
consistent

716
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,840
same questions by the same

717
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,399
interview

718
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
and interpreting interpreting those are

719
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
the answers using the same criteria

720
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,559
it's enough to talk to

721
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,918
most knowledgeable experts

722
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,360
but if you want it more detailed you'll

723
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,719
have to attract more people

724
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
a challenging part of report is to

725
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,919
identify

726
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,679
dependencies and causal

727
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,640
links

728
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,559
identifying first order second order

729
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,840
mistakes sometimes

730
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,039
a person

731
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,159
would

732
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,559
balance dollars wants to

733
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,720
demonstrate to you that his direction is

734
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,039
best

735
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,679
and your task is

736
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,640
not to

737
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,360
not to let it happen

738
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,360
if you want to do everything on your own

739
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,159
you really want to have someone

740
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,640
who is very

741
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,919
objective

742
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,360
in their

743
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,360
assessment

744
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,880
and you should understand that despite

745
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,039
the support of top management and line

746
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
management not everybody would

747
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,519
support

748
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,760
you would you would have to live with

749
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,679
conflict

750
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
and you would sometimes have to impact

751
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
it

752
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,360
top to bottom

753
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
i mentioned that we created our own

754
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,159
tools to carry out self-assessment

755
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,559
in order to do that

756
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,039
we had to identify the same criteria

757
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,960
when we when you read through

758
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,159
each of

759
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,399
the directions it's huge huge amount of

760
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,639
text

761
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,440
and in

762
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
self-management self-assessment is okay

763
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
you read and you say okay this i have

764
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,559
this i don't have but when you do a more

765
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,399
detailed assessment

766
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,919
you really need to understand what

767
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,799
specifically is

768
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,480
what is it that you are lacking

769
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
specifically what is it that you have

770
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,240
specifically so we carried out

771
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,799
decomposition of the same this is the

772
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,039
way we did it

773
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,320
so we

774
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
took a model and translation of this

775
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,600
model

776
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,600
and then this model was split into

777
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,600
segments by semantics by

778
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
ideas behind it so we used couple of

779
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,800
criteria

780
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,760
[Music]

781
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
and criteria was

782
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,279
self-identified because bisim doesn't

783
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,200
have it

784
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,840
like publication and working on the

785
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,720
processes as as necessary

786
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,000
but again you need to be broader here

787
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,480
code analysis

788
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,080
pan system analysis etc

789
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,880
and all of that

790
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,600
is given to the stakeholders and we have

791
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
it split why is that whatever you

792
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,839
published it doesn't mean that

793
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,599
stakeholders have this information in

794
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,000
their minds

795
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
de facto

796
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,918
so we came up with more than 400

797
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,599
criteria

798
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,359
to carry out our self-assessment

799
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,679
all of you

800
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,719
present at

801
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,159
this track here

802
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,119
ask themselves whether it pays back i

803
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,399
mean

804
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,359
all this labor cost

805
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,719
yes

806
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,560
yes

807
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,000
and let me explain you what i mean

808
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,480
after self-assessment we calculated the

809
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,079
cost and we looked at

810
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,960
what contractors offer

811
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,359
and looks like we are in profit our

812
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,560
resource expenditure

813
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,800
as compared to the cost that we would

814
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,240
have incurred by using contractors

815
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,480
differ

816
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,040
in our favor

817
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
so after analyzing we saw the areas for

818
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
development

819
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,400
that we

820
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
shine away from

821
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,880
because of high load we all know that

822
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,200
opsak is very loaded

823
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
we have more developers than security

824
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
guys

825
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,200
and we knew this area of

826
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,000
action existed but we didn't approach it

827
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599
but when we saw it on paper

828
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,800
on our screens

829
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,079
it became obvious to us that we need to

830
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,280
plan for correspondent actions

831
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
and for six months now

832
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,280
we are abiding by the plan

833
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,839
that we came up with after our

834
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,040
self-assessment in my presentation i'd

835
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,359
like to give special thanks to

836
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,119
a waspsam community the community

837
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,200
because their

838
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,280
expertise and

839
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,079
what they do for developing these models

840
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,800
were of paramount importance

841
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
we would have failed in our

842
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,200
self-assessment

843
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
venture

844
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,680
both

845
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,119
models

846
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,800
contribute

847
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
substantially

848
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
but we also have bank of russia here and

849
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,040
not for nothing do we have it here

850
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,240
thing is that this year

851
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,319
software security uh profile was updated

852
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,359
we now also have an additional

853
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,760
application both of them related to

854
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,560
software security so why i mention it

855
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
here

856
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,960
you might

857
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,280
you you may think that it's not related

858
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,839
to self-assessment but think twice if

859
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,480
you're in financial sector or in fintech

860
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,800
sector

861
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,000
you may want

862
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,640
to look at this profile

863
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,920
unlike many

864
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,400
norms it's it's it's rather it's rather

865
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
good

866
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
you see what's

867
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
um

868
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,599
and you can go ahead and develop it in

869
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
this expertise in your company there are

870
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,320
also practices

871
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,719
[Music]

872
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,599
if you don't want to use

873
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
if you are not from fintech or you don't

874

of testing security you need to

888
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,640
understand at which stage what is being

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,839
done and where it goes

understand that

you know

it's not your guidelines that you just

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,440
follow

907
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,320
it's just a kind of cross-section of

knowledge if avas sum is not good for us

909

it doesn't mean that it's not good for

external audit

914
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,560
does not mean that you are not going to

915
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
expand your own resources

916
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,800
and doing self-assessment allows you to

917
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
get the

918
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,040
point from which you can depart

919
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,480
and carry out progress identification

920
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,160
with this i would like to thank you for

921
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,320
your attention and i'll be happy to take

922
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,560
your questions

923
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,839
good day

924
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,599
could you please share some real life

925
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,800
examples

926
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,520
of issues you encountered in

927
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,839
self-assessment

928
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,640
something you know the juicy details

929
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,680
i actually had it on one of my slides

930
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,240
here it is

931
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
starting with the preparatory stage

932
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,640
you're going to

933
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,319
have difficulties

934
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,200
i didn't have any difficulties in

935
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,319
gaining support but

936
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,119
it's

937
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,280
it is difficult it could be difficult

938
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,480
it's something to overcome

939
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,720
depending on the size and scale of the

940
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,520
organization

941
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,160
splitting the responsibility zone is not

942
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,119
an easy task at all

943
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
so i think i would

944
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,760
mention these two

945
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
while i'm having my the mic my quick

946
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,920
next question would be

947
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
so you carried out your self-assessment

948
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,480
how do you how do you understand

949
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,319
is the system good enough in terms of

950
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,680
your maturity i mean

951
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,079
the main part of the slide

952
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,800
the

953
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,119
background data

954
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,079
and then statistics

955
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,319
i didn't show

956
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,720
all the details because of nda yes

957
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,839
if you think that

958
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,720
you signed nda and you can

959
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,800
go on and

960
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,960
talk about it

961
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
so bad

962
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,760
my question is this

963
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,200
it's probably more about

964
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
coming up with arguments and getting

965
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,920
funding and all that on the 1st of may

966
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
we had a decree

967
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,079
on support in

968
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,200
information security

969
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,240
do you think this could be helpful

970
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,960
in

971
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
putting forward the processes that you

972
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,119
were describing in your presentation

973
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,040
they think it would help

974
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,680
i can't give you an exact answer to this

975
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,200
question

976
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,520
funding is not something that i'm in

977
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,800
charge of

978
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,680
but

979
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,480
how about arguments

980
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
yes in terms of arguments this might

981
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,160
help

982
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,640
if you already have in place

983
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,079
a division you can

984
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,839
give grounds why it's needed

985
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,839
i actually gave you a slide with

986
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,240
arguments if you have an idea behind it

987
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,319
i think you won't have any problems

988
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,079
getting the funding if you want to get

989
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,960
the funding from a vice president or

990
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,760
your line manager or you know

991
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,680
what i meant

992
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,119
is that according to this new

993
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,560
decree

994
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,839
you should have

995
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,400
a person in charge of it

996
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,680
okay in big organizations

997
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,560
they definitely do have

998
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,720
this kind of departments in smallish

999
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,839
organizations however

1000
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,560
it could be only just a man of straw you

1001
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,599
know very formal

1002
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,720
a small question

1003
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,520
i'm here yes

1004
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,800
couple of questions rather

1005
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,119
my first question has to do

1006
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,880
it

1007
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,720
has to do with something different

1008
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
you mentioned that when you do

1009
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,319
did maturity assessment you identified

1010
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,880
certain areas for improvement

1011
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,280
it highlighted some areas of improvement

1012
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,119
and you also managed to plan some

1013
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,560
remedial action based on that initially

1014
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,280
when you were giving your arguments

1015
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,400
you mentioned three risks

1016
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,599
that you informed the management about

1017
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,359
and that allowed you to launch this

1018
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,200
whole event so the results that you got

1019
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,480
the results of

1020
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,920
self-assessment

1021
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,440
did they lead to revisit the degree of

1022
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,560
risk

1023
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,880
it going up or down

1024
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,440
we did risk assessment for the jobs

1025
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,000
we carry out this self-assessment using

1026
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,800
internal or external resources

1027
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,240
and this could

1028
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,800
lead to certain risks

1029
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,200
i mean it's not about results

1030
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,000
by carrying out the assessment

1031
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,520
on our own

1032
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,000
we didn't have any risks we could have

1033
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,200
had

1034
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,839
should we use external contractors okay

1035
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,480
got it my second question is this okay

1036
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
so you carried out this job you planned

1037
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,800
for some remedial action and this

1038
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
remedial action is going to happen at

1039
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,160
one point of time

1040
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,720
and obviously you would

1041
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,839
need

1042
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:42,960
to

1043
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,280
reiterate this job

1044
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,640
would you do it

1045
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,480
same way as you just described or you

1046
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,160
would have changed something what would

1047
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,880
you

1048
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,520
what what would it be if you would

1049
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,680
change something i would

1050
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,800
increase

1051
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,160
the automation degree

1052
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,440
we had

1053
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,839
certain resources allocated

1054
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:04,800
so

1055
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,680
we

1056
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,520
under automated so to speak

1057
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,160
automation would lead to less

1058
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,200
resource

1059
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,839
intensity

1060
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,520
i think it would

1061
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,560
impact our timeline

1062
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,720
for example first

1063
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,839
first stage the understanding of

1064
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,680
a status quo is not something that we're

1065
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,880
going to do in the next stage

1066
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,280
i mean the simple assessment okay got it

1067
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,520
thank you

1068
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,280
hi there

1069
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,720
a very interesting presentation thank

1070
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,920
you very much

1071
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,319
my question is this one you carried out

1072
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,920
self-assessment have you encountered a

1073
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,800
situation when you have several teams

1074
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,400
like several teams developing software

1075
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,400
making use of different practices

1076
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,480
introducing certain heterogeneity in

1077
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,640
your assessment if so how did you

1078
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,319
resolve the issue

1079
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,720
we are talking about opsec rather than

1080
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
developing teams

1081
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,200
but even in opsec they do make use of

1082
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,119
various practices you're absolutely

1083
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,400
right

1084
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,319
because they are dealing with various

1085
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,400
directions of activities some of them

1086
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
are general

1087
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,920
like processes

1088
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,599
irrespective of what you're dealing with

1089
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,240
you have to have processes

1090
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,720
but some of them are unique like code

1091
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,240
analysis

1092
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,640
code analysis uh are not in charge of

1093
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,440
pen tests so

1094
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,160
we had an average assessment so to speak

1095
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,079
if i if i make sense

1096
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,079
yes you do

1097
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,720
when you develop

1098
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,880
we would use

1099
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,240
certain

1100
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,559
scales and scores

1101
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,040
in other analytics who would single out

1102
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,359
the department who are not in charge of

1103
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,520
this particular direction or who are in

1104
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,400
charge so as to introduce additional you

1105
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,119
know correction

1106
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,280
check good day thank you for this

1107
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,559
presentation

1108
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,559
and what was the headcount how many

1109
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,720
people were involved in doing it

1110
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,200
and um

1111
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,480
were they

1112
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,680
full

1113
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,599
full time on it or

1114
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,720
two days a week

1115
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,319
yes uh this is to answer your question

1116
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,079
i come give you uh headquarters

1117
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,720
so that he

1118
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,680
this is this is a sum

1119
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,480
this is a sum of um

1120
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,599
our

1121
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,000
resource intensity eight by five by 16.

1122
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,520
so our resource intensity was not eight

1123
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,440
by five sixteen

1124
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,359
right over here

1125
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,880
you mentioned that you carried out

1126
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,319
self-assessment

1127
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,440
but how independent is it

1128
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,119
i mean people talk to each other

1129
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,400
interact and they are sometimes in very

1130
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
good friendly terms

1131
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,200
i

1132
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,079
i doubt that it could be

1133
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,599
fully independent

1134
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,280
i agree with that

1135
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,440
that's why i mentioned specifically that

1136
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,960
we had to

1137
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,040
process those

1138
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,720
errors one we would notice that

1139
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,440
there is a desire to you know

1140
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,760
mask certain flaws

1141
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,839
and we just pick the right person to do

1142
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,520
the job

1143
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,359
thank you

1144
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,760
time is up uh should you have any more

1145
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,680
questions i'll be more than happy to

1146
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,119
take it to the margins of the event

1147
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,760
oh and please pick the most interesting

1148
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,599
question no no you should pick the most

1149
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,040
interesting question

1150
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,839
all right

1151
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,440
how you had so many questions so

1152
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,000
difficult

1153
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,319
i love the questions posed by this guy

1154
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,480
over here

1155
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,380
thank you thank you very much

1156
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:40,050
[Applause]
