1
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,199
one hour

2
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,439
and at the same time we're starting city

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,160
fa city afi that you can play during the

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
first and second day

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,160
individual participation great quests so

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
definitely do try yourself

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,558
and during

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,000
today we will have a one hour break from

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,440
uh two to three o'clock and uh then we

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
will continue with the presentations

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,280
and i'd like to invite federica meliana

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,239
with

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,120
his presentation on

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,000
uh

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
the

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
multi-party computations

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,760
hi everyone my name is peter and i work

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,399
at bloomtech and

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,359
i work on multi-party computation for

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,119
quite a while so i will talk to you

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,640
about it the clicker doesn't work

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,640
unfortunately

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,320
okay

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,880
it worked

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
do i change the slides or you change the

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
slides

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
it was turned on okay so yeah we will

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,759
figure it out

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,479
uh on the on the run so let's start with

30
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
a simple motivating example and the

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
graph here shows the computer vision

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
systems progress

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,600
uh in the quality

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
and as you can see in the beginning it's

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
quite slow in development but in 2010 we

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
have a jump a quantum leap and even

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
exceeding the level of 94.9 do you know

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,159
what it is yes that's a human level of

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
image recognition so in 2015 the robots

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
started to

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,318
distinguish cats on the photos from dogs

42
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,038
on the photos better than the humans do

43
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,959
so let's go back to 2010

44
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,080
and

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
ask what has happened there imagenet was

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
published in 2010. the data said that

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,879
had thousands of images that were

48
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,840
marked and then the crowd started to

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
work on this so

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
high quality data is sometimes a

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,800
revolution or a game changer but it's

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
always good

53
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,000
so here's another example

54
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,200
six netflix well known company decides

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
to exploit

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,959
the

57
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
crowd and they publish the data set

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
that has the data about the viewers the

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
movies and the

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,920
ratings set by the users so those are

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,599
not cats and of course it's the

62
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,080
personified and the names of persons and

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,879
films are

64
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
changed and some data was even

65
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,599
tinkered with so

66
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
netflix thought about privacy

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
so the teams were contesting and one

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
million dollar was

69
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
the prize and in 2009

70
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,159
two or three smart guys from texas

71
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,239
university decided to

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
correlate netflix data with imdb data

73
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
and compared the marks sent by the users

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,879
and dates

75
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
and thus they were able to re-identify

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,159
nearly half of the netflix data set

77
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,879
users nothing terrible happened but of

78
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
course

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,599
there were

80
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
court cases

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
the contest was closed and

82
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,040
the story went viral so the data

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
making the data safe for the data

84
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
subjects

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
is

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
not really

87
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,319
a very simple task this is a standard

88
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,480
slide i use and

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
usually we choose two or three or four

90
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,798
data leaks happened recently

91
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,079
and

92
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
we put on the slide one has leaked

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,080
so this time we decided not to do so

94
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
there's a lot of licks

95
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
maybe someone get

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,639
will get hurt by not mentioning them so

97
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
i cannot i could not resist

98
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,160
uh searching myself in any data with of

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120
course some some

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,800
trepidation

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
and sometimes friends ask what what's

102
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,440
about them there and usually also i find

103
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,479
nothing and recently we had a leak where

104
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,479
i found myself

105
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,440
and most of my friends and colleagues

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
and of course i didn't like it

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,919
the case here is that user data

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
has long-term usefulness so if you lost

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
the cards numbers

110
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,800
um it's a catastrophe right but you can

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
you know call the bank and block the

112
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
card and that's it

113
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,800
and the problem is solved but if a

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
person is for example

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
seriously ill then

116
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,960
you know

117
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,880
it will not be fixed soon

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
but it can be commercialized for long

119
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
term

120
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,680
and data leaks are not the only

121
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
stopping thing

122
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
because the companies don't want to

123
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,080
exchange data because this means

124
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
lack of

125
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,560
loss of value for this data

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
both for the

127
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
the person who gives the data and for

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
the one who receives for example i want

129
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,560
to get a pizza but this data cannot be

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,919
sold fast in 20 minutes i will not be

131
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,600
wanting a pizza and if i'm scared

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,240
that's a good

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,919
that's a good thing because for some

134
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,400
time i can trade this this date and of

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
course exchanging data you can also uh

136
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,000
get in conflict with some regulator and

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,639
that comes the consequences can be very

138
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,600
different

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
like a very big fine

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
or something

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
something

142
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,479
very mild so the companies don't want to

143
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,440
invest in such synergies even if

144
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,720
it

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,600
broadens the business

146
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
so what do we do first of all we can do

147
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,720
nothing we can stay in the same paradigm

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
and base our products on that paradigm

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,639
but the risk is high that someone will

150
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
outpace

151
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
i remember the times when you had to

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
fill in the

153
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,479
the

154
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,440
form

155
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
and that was the scoring a couple of

156
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
databases checked and you can still do

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
it today but you will be losing to those

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
who are

159
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
you know more aggressive and for example

160
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
who know that i'm a skier

161
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
so the idea number three is that uh

162
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
collaboration and data fusion

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
is a useful thing an important thing and

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,799
to some extent it's inevitable

165
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
but you need to be to know how to work

166
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
with it and the answer lies in the

167
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,360
technology zone

168
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
the landscape is like this you have like

169
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
five technologies i

170
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
put them on two axis the higher the more

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
protected your data is and uh to the

172
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
right the more

173
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
the more

174
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
the higher precision

175
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
so starting with what netflix did it's

176
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,919
not doesn't work

177
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
then we have differential privacy great

178
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
algorithm

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
but doesn't work very precisely and the

180
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,680
idea is

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
let us put some noise in the data

182
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,919
but the story here is that you either

183
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
have too much noise or too little noise

184
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,120
the data is either not protected enough

185
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
or the value is destroyed

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
then secure enclaves hardware

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,639
technologies to the right to the on the

188
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
button great thing

189
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
but unfortunately in the current

190
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,159
russian realities those technologies are

191
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,679
not

192
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,719
uh

193
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
are not actually accessible so then we

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
have only uh homomorphic

195
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
encryption and

196
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
multi-party computing

197
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
and as mpc is my

198
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,160
my interest then

199
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
let's

200
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
step deeper into this so

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,800
secret split is a very well known uh

202
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
crypto algorithm in

203
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
genta

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
the city

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
there was a room that stored all the

206
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
important

207
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
documents by

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
administration like whole inquisition

209
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
documents and there were

210
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,760
three locks on the doe with three people

211
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
the highest standing people

212
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
owning the key

213
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
they had together together and

214
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,959
then open their locks and doors

215
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
this is secret split

216
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,839
and this is

217
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,279
digitized um

218
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,040
thing do you this is the true

219
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,399
the true thing so i got the penguin and

220
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,200
i generated a random mask so if i give

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
you

222
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
this mask

223
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,080
i disclose zero information about my

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
penguin because this can be a part of

225
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
penguin or a mona lisa or you know night

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,959
night shift and whatever else

227
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
and the idea is that there are protocols

228
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,079
that enable you to

229
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
summarize multiply

230
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,600
um

231
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
and do other things with the numbers

232
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
without knowing with knowing only their

233
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
parts so this algorithm is very simple

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
and uh to be

235
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
a very

236
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
direct and precise

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
let me show it to you so

238
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
three people

239
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
are

240
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,519
have a lot of money and they would like

241
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,800
to decide

242
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
how much money they have

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,880
together but not knowing how much

244
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
other ones have so

245
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,839
three people

246
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,160
would split their amount of money into

247
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,800
three digits

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,680
so we have three parties and

249
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,480
one

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
number is given

251
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
is kept with uh

252
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
with you and then the two are sent to

253
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
the others

254
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,600
so on the second step everyone has three

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
random numbers and they cannot

256
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,399
decode the parts the original number so

257
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,839
they just

258
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
summarize those numbers and go to step

259
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
number three

260
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
they have three random numbers

261
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
of course uh the sum of three random

262
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
random numbers are random

263
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
and you have minus 30 plus minus 3 plus

264
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
43 equals

265
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
10.

266
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
they can child together

267
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
and

268
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
whisper to someone

269
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
uh

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
for example to me and then i will be the

271
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,519
only one knowing the result and i did

272
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
not see the data that the calculation

273
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
was uh based on and i didn't even know

274
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
the algorithm

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
now the same with the multiplication

276
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,519
it's more complex it's not the protocol

277
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
itself it's rather

278
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
the main

279
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,839
idea to multiply x by y

280
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
we add a and b

281
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
where we mask the

282
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
originals we

283
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,519
split the arguments and we come to a

284
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
conclusion where

285
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,279
parties can multiply

286
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
the masked version of numbers i simplify

287
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
this a little bit it's a little bit

288
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
harder but

289
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,639
you can multiply

290
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,880
and you probably know what this is

291
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,639
linear regression machine learning

292
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,959
bi is

293
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,680
the

294
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
weights and x i

295
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
are the predictors or independent

296
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,959
variables

297
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
so this formula has nothing but

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
multiplication and

299
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
some

300
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
some summation of numbers

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,880
so

302
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
we have parties running the protocol and

303
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,880
calculating the linear regression

304
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
not knowing the predictors not knowing

305
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
the weights of the model so linear

306
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
regression is a simple algorithm

307
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,279
and if we dig deeper

308
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
pretty much any

309
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
machine learning method

310
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,200
is uh

311
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,839
in the end

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,519
just pluses and multiplication so

313
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,880
you can manage the

314
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,320
the

315
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
accuracy

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,720
by

317
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
adding the number of

318
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
the length of the polynomial so you can

319
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
operate by

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,399
digits you can operate by data but you

321
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,639
can actually split them and make it a

322
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
secret so here's how it's organized on

323
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
the physical levels our system is

324
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,079
distributed

325
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
when a party wants to

326
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
participate in in our

327
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
project we

328
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,320
give it to him as an open source so

329
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
it can be audited

330
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
and

331
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,320
then

332
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
the party runs this module in

333
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,199
their

334
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
computational

335
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
module and becomes a part of

336
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,959
mutual computational network which is

337
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,638
not designed not to

338
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,040
calculate the machine learning models

339
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
but to protect data of all the parties

340
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,240
and of course there's a lot of

341
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
protocols to the orchestration

342
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,399
to

343
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,240
ensure that everything works fine but

344
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,160
the orchestrator does not

345
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
compute

346
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
and thus you have

347
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,720
a network

348
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
where you can confidentially get the

349
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,360
data

350
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,560
cryptographically mix it

351
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,360
and in the end you can get

352
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
aggregation aggregated data that cannot

353
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,199
be

354
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
proven proven

355
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,000
that cannot be

356
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,560
deciphered back and personalized back

357
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
so where can you use it

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
let's

359
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,000
start but what does the taxi film has to

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
have to do it it's one of our first

361
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,360
cases that we ran two or three years ago

362
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
those years there were several operators

363
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,279
of taxi fleet and the drivers were

364
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,240
distributed between them

365
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
and each and every operator was limiting

366
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,320
the time and blocking the uh the driver

367
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
from driving more because of course the

368
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
driver is

369
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,519
tired and needs to rest

370
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399
but the drivers that were very willing

371
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,240
to

372
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,639
drive i can drive eight hours by with

373
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,920
the index

374
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,759
then work eight hours with the city and

375
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
eight hours with get

376
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,000
after 24 hours he understands that i

377
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
slept enough and starts giving me orders

378
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
again so this does not look like a good

379
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,759
thing

380
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,880
but

381
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
exchanging information about the drivers

382
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
and how long they work

383
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
is not something that

384
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
the aggregators want

385
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
so the task is

386
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
how do we calculate the amount of time

387
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,639
the taxi driver

388
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
worked without knowing

389
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,639
how much they uh they worked in any

390
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,639
separate one this was exactly the

391
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
algorithm we described in the beginning

392
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,399
and

393
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,839
of course

394
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,560
this was very easy to do at first you

395
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
had 90 percent of the market

396
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
and uh

397
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
we ideally need three parties at least

398
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,440
that

399
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
uh you know

400
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
even better if there are more of them

401
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
and they need to be

402
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,079
quite precise but this is a good example

403
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,880
of

404
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,520
the idea

405
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,119
that

406
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
with a very simple operation you can

407
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
solve a task that was unsolvable

408
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,520
previously

409
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
so the next point of application of

410
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,880
those technologies

411
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,240
is tech uh

412
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,200
ads and marketing and there's a lot of

413
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,799
tasks with uh you know cross

414
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,840
correlating the identifiers

415
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,000
so

416
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,980
[Music]

417
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,039
like how many boys have done this or

418
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,840
that or how many women have done this or

419
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,960
that

420
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
sales leave to

421
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
analyze the result of

422
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,559
the

423
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,039
market the marketing

424
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
campaign results so this is called

425
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,640
private join in compute

426
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,440
and we do such things

427
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,799
and recently facebook has started to

428
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,760
work

429
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,320
very much uh very deeply in that

430
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,960
direction they know called meta so we

431
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
have quite significant competitors here

432
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
and the thing i love the most fintech

433
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,080
why i love it the most because first

434
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
there's a lot of banks and we won't have

435
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,679
the issue with taxi aggregators

436
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
and money loves

437
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
silence

438
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
the amount of tasks

439
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
is

440
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
very big starting from credit scoring

441
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,919
and also including anti-fraud activities

442
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
and the collaboration can happen between

443
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
the banks bank to bank and also

444
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
between banks with non-banks we had a

445
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
pilot with quite a big bank

446
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,678
and quite a significant telecom operator

447
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
196 predictors and one vector and the

448
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
bank had 90 predictors

449
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
the idea was to train the model so that

450
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,960
the parties don't see the predictors or

451
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
the target

452
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,559
the target variable

453
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
so we had lining a regression and uh

454
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,360
multi-layered neural nets there and

455
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,240
here's how it looked

456
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
okay

457
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
so it's important to pay your attention

458
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
here to

459
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,919
only 600 seconds

460
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,960
for people who know that

461
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,840
besides data sets were big 5 million

462
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
rows

463
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,679
and

464
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
usually it's much faster

465
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,320
so the cryptography of course

466
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
when you add the

467
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,600
cryptography there's a lot of overhead

468
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,720
so our model

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
had to spend 600 seconds and uh

470
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,720
on the sixth segback we had the

471
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,600
highest number of

472
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,640
0.91 0.76

473
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,120
then inference was

474
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,360
23 seconds one million rows

475
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,559
we didn't know the targets for this

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,159
for this inference

477
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
and jenny was

478
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,960
0.51 to

479
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,559
0.517 so this was an experiment and of

480
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
course

481
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
they

482
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,760
could train this model on other data

483
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,039
and so other

484
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,000
and on other methods we had

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
better accuracy despite the fact that

486
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
we

487
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
had our uh model using cryptography

488
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,679
and we had eight times increase

489
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
because we had

490
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,640
we ran it one year ago and as we scaled

491
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,159
this since then

492
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,400
now we would be eight times faster

493
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,360
running that experiment not 600 seconds

494
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,960
but maybe less than 10 seconds so that's

495
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,520
pretty much it and i'm happy to answer

496
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
all your questions

497
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,919
and also the speakers can choose the

498
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,200
person

499
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
to be given a prize for the best

500
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
question

501
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,799
and we'll give the t-shirts

502
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,679
thanks peter two questions first

503
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,799
regarding the business part

504
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,200
generally speaking companies are not

505
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,799
very

506
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
much interested in selling the data so

507
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,480
the model is each and every company is

508
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
uh using their own data and then

509
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
use

510
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,799
the data for instance

511
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,799
and this is

512
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,039
important this is okay because

513
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,879
apart from from

514
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
it

515
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,360
but this model is a third-party model

516
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
why would it be interesting to the

517
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,919
companies because the economy doesn't

518
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,720
look

519
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,919
very well

520
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,679
if they

521
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
can you know train their models on their

522
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,720
own data

523
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,799
so we look a bit differently on this

524
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,919
it's

525
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,320
more convenient to train on your own

526
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,919
data

527
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,039
but the synergy is very valuable and

528
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,039
possible when you

529
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,120
multiply the amount of

530
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,678
data the result is usually better

531
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,280
we are aimed at creating an environment

532
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,480
for confidential information synergy so

533
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,919
i can take the same banks

534
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,520
i have

535
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
accounts in three banks

536
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,240
one is for salary one is for

537
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
including good card and the third one is

538
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,799
where i store my money

539
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
but there's uh you know a tax office no

540
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,960
your tax office does not have an update

541
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,919
talk to your to the banker you like and

542
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,039
uh he will explain to you

543
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,919
to the previous slide

544
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,760
how just is it to compare the models

545
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,720
trained locally and with npc as it

546
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,279
limits your amount of methods

547
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,000
with local training and no one will use

548
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,720
the

549
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,000
uh

550
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
regression probably you know people will

551
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,880
use gradient boosting something even

552
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
more

553
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
something even better

554
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,159
my intuition says that you know

555
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,760
the

556
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,919
results will be better and here you are

557
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,159
limited by the method

558
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
you are right if you use gradient

559
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,880
boosting on the uh on the

560
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
data

561
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,440
on the merged data yeah the results will

562
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,400
be better

563
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
but

564
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
uh

565
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,559
the

566
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
experiment cannot be

567
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,200
cannot be run so the genie number

568
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,760
is better than the number that we

569
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,279
received with gradient boosting on the

570
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,200
separate data sets so you cannot join

571
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
the two data sets in real life that

572
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,000
would be a compliance issue

573
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
you my name is ziggy sokolova and the

574
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,279
questions i have first is the cases and

575
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
the examples that you

576
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,679
described how much time did it take

577
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,000
and the second question is if we grow

578
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,919
the number of sides from two to three

579
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,120
and more

580
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
how more how much

581
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
how much difficult

582
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,279
do the cases become the implementation

583
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,480
takes a lot of time yes a good question

584
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
technically everything can be solved

585
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
there's a lot of optimizations and a lot

586
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
of hints and tips and tricks you can

587
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
split the secrets

588
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,080
there's

589
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,360
implicit schemes not between 10 but

590
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,159
between for example and three of them

591
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,640
technically everything is solved

592
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,600
technologically there are issues with

593
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
implementation so with taxi

594
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,000
unfortunately we did not launch it but

595
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
we implemented it within half a year and

596
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
with banks it's still

597
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,640
in implementation phase different issues

598
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
there's a lot of compliance questions

599
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
legally you need to prove that this can

600
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,440
be

601
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
done and there's no bank

602
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
secret

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,799
loss and if you implement anything in a

604
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,279
bank you know this takes a lot a lot of

605
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,520
time

606
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,360
hollander pinchuk and i wanted to ask

607
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
about

608
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,559
running the system

609
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,799
so after the proof of concept

610
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,360
do i get it right and each and every

611
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
party should update their data to for

612
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
the results to be usable

613
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
this is the first question and the

614
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
second one

615
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,360
in case you get additional data

616
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
how easy is it to

617
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,600
add the data to the system so that we

618
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,520
could get extra value

619
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,919
on the first question it's true every

620
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,120
country

621
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
every party creates their own

622
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,039
data set and

623
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,279
supports it and

624
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
second question depends on

625
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,720
on the party

626
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
if the party is ready i am ready to

627
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,240
implement within two days

628
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,120
dimitri smith the question is

629
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,320
yeah i'm here to the left

630
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,320
technologically

631
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,600
homomorphic

632
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,240
calculations are quite heavy

633
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,039
so

634
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,559
can you comment

635
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,080
on

636
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
how hard is it to expand this schema

637
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,080
and the next question is the

638
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,000
implementation cases marketing and

639
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
everything that has to do with it

640
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
online sales

641
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,799
that would be quite interesting and

642
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,440
to to be put in this game so what

643
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,760
thoughts do you have for maybe

644
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,559
uh

645
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,039
what uh you know what you think about

646
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
developing that

647
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,600
so on the first question 600 seconds is

648
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
uh

649
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
the reality that we have unfortunately

650
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,960
we cannot run it faster so we improved

651
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
it eight times

652
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
but

653
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
we had to

654
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,640
significantly

655
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,120
work on on the

656
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,279
on the complexity

657
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,280
and

658
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
[Music]

659
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,559
we needed

660
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
to merge the segments

661
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,600
so

662
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,360
to get better targeting and there's a

663
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
lot of issues there

664
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
the second is opening up and

665
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,000
however secretively you gathered it

666
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
there's a lot of potential leaks so

667
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,360
we tried to add the third party that

668
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
would not know anything about the data

669
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,520
that

670
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,120
knows about the segment segment 42 show

671
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,720
the cat's ads

672
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,919
but this also creates potential uh

673
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
information leakage so instead we go to

674
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
private join compute

675
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
where you need to you know cross-check

676
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,760
the identifiers and look at how the

677
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,480
sales have changed or

678
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
work on two segments deciding how many

679
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,880
boys have bought

680
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,360
gillette razors

681
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,039
and the follow-up question regarding the

682
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,240
gdpr

683
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
yeah we thought about it and

684
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,159
we started working on this

685
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
maybe four years ago

686
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,399
the international markets were available

687
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
then and

688
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,279
saw the commission the gdpr commission

689
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,480
one year ago

690
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,080
has approved

691
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,960
the usage of

692
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,360
multi-party computations to anonymize

693
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,399
data so it is

694
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
really

695
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,399
an option

696
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,158
next question peter um

697
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,960
academy

698
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,840
uh

699
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
for example we have mad tech

700
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,959
where you have

701
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
discrete

702
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,520
data sets with a

703
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,480
low amount of

704
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,520
data low amount of patients

705
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,880
and

706
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
as they cannot create a compute cluster

707
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
anonymizing and noise will not help how

708
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,679
do they

709
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,399
what do what should they do

710
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,960
and maybe we can run npc approach and

711
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,520
npc on their site

712
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,360
by for example adding some npcs

713
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
splitting the data set

714
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,480
so let me answer so let me start the

715
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,000
answer with the first and then the

716
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
second we will have a discussion because

717
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,919
i didn't understand it quite well first

718
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,919
of all if you don't have computational

719
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,360
power there's no silver bullet

720
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,320
well no no

721
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,799
i meant that we have small amount of

722
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,159
players and

723
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,679
we don't have

724
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,520
uh

725
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,640
we cannot use noise we can not use

726
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,799
anonymization

727
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,360
and if

728
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,279
we have one player

729
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,519
we cannot pass the data

730
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,279
so the doctors would like to save the

731
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,279
world from aids

732
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,320
cancer

733
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,440
etc

734
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,960
but they cannot pass the data

735
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,000
they don't have the competencies to

736
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,880
create the models

737
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
what do they do

738
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,640
so you'd like to gather data from the

739
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,440
doctors yes

740
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,440
yeah good question i don't know the the

741
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,200
exact answer

742
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,320
i i understand they are all anonymized

743
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,120
they remove the name of

744
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
the patient and then they send

745
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,720
using using whatsapp

746
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,840
but uh you know with your scheme with uh

747
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,399
segment splitting and obfuscating the

748
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,080
personal data

749
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,880
uh

750
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,399
on the left

751
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,799
this this does not work right

752
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,200
so this is

753
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,679
you know a target segment for

754
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
reducing the quality of data in those

755
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,120
technologies

756
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,480
well i uh i was specifically

757
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
mentioning

758
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,200
uh

759
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,480
you know homeopathy and

760
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
not non-proven medicine the same is

761
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,960
about anonymization and you can trust in

762
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,840
the anonymization like netflix did

763
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
and it was not a good idea

764
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,200
so

765
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,159
anonymizing is not not

766
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,080
an answer okay good so can we

767
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,120
run some mpc

768
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,399
like algorithm with on one party

769
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,000
well yeah the party can uh run two

770
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,120
servers and split the data and then run

771
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,880
it run it

772
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,080
uh onto service yeah doable it's one of

773
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,880
the one of the answers to our question i

774
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,399
don't know the exact issue but you can

775
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,200
definitely do it okay we want we won't

776
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,279
go into a deep discussion but thank you

777
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,399
for the questions good one

778
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,559
hello peter hankin the question is uh

779
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,760
less on

780
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,240
technology side

781
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
and um

782
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,679
fintech how did you solve the

783
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,679
152

784
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,360
do you work with a regulator

785
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,919
yeah we do work with the regulator and

786
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,039
of course we

787
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,830
i know that i can create a

788
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,279
[Music]

789
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,519
scheme with no personal data

790
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,960
but

791
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,120
we start from the idea that the you know

792
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
passport number regardless regardless of

793
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
how much

794
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,039
hashes you run on it is still a personal

795
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,360
data so we

796
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
close this question with the user

797
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
agreement

798
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,360
and

799
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
regarding the bank secrets that are

800
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,600
regulated by

801
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
um

802
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
by the the central bank of russia then

803
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,079
we are waiting for their position on

804
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,199
this topic

805
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,719
do you have any other questions dear

806
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,199
audience

807
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
thank you peter

808
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,199
alexander can call for your money and

809
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,560
the question is

810
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,079
can those systems protect themselves so

811
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,239
one of the parties is compromised their

812
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,719
data is poisoned by some false data what

813
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,159
can we do

814
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,200
we can actually do a lot the npcs

815
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,800
of differ there are different levels of

816
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,919
information protection

817
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,599
we

818
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,040
thought only

819
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,679
in the presentation we considered the

820
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,560
parties to be

821
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,800
to have no malicious intent but you can

822
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,960
think of models that

823
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,680
have malicious parties and they called

824
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,960
verified secret split that allow without

825
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
seeing the data and working only with

826
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
the secrets

827
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,000
to understand whether the data was

828
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,160
poisoned

829
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,440
so if something went wrong we ban the

830
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
participant

831
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,359
and

832
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,800
you know

833
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
decide on the results and can run an

834
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
investigation

835
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
thank you thank you great question

836
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
thank you peter for your presentation

837
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,730
and use you talked about mpc for

838
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,900
[Music]

839
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
binaries

840
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,839
for numbers but what do we do with the

841
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,960
images or the language well i don't know

842
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,000
i didn't try it i think it's the same as

843
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,839
with the pictures

844
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,359
and you probably will have to

845
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,560
you know

846
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,839
convert

847
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,960
the data into some digitized

848
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,079
thing form but then you can run

849
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,240
pretty much the same algorithm on them

850
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
one more question you talked about the

851
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,400
legislation and

852
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,560
what is your own opinion on how much is

853
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,280
our current legislation

854
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,040
advanced to uh actually

855
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,880
allow mvc

856
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,170
to be used

857

[Music]

858
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,680
the answer is i will give you a gift on

859
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,079
that great question and it's hard to

860
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,240
answer it if you

861
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,800
have asked this question like

862
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,640
say two months ago

863
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,599
the answer would be one and

864
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,440
currently i don't know

865
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,680
the positions of the regulators are

866
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
changing very fast

867
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,880
and there's a number of unpleasant

868
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,520
centralization

869
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,079
events

870
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
some can do everything some can do

871
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,079
nothing

872
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,520
and

873
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,320
let us pretend that nothing happens and

874
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,839
live in a paradigm

875
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,640
that we had till the end of january

876
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,119
and at that moment our regulators worked

877
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,480
quite modernly as

878
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,240
they were answering the uh

879
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
the challenges of the time so now they

880
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,480
stopped doing this and i hope they will

881
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,880
restart doing this

882
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,040
moving further

883
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,880
thank you thank you for presentation the

884
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
question is

885
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,800
when we talk about the new systems

886
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
like in the beginning of 21st century we

887
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,680
had

888
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,680
elliptic

889
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,200
now we have

890
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,400
a new

891
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
idea with

892
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,040
parallelized calculations

893
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
did you did you use something to prove

894
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,800
the uh crypto resilience and

895
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,220
but it can be hacked

896
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,800
[Music]

897
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
so the question is two part twofold

898
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,839
we have the base on this we have the

899
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,160
database and it's analytical and we can

900
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,480
prove that what we do is secure because

901
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
we use the cryptographic primitives that

902
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,079
are known to be secure

903
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,480
regarding the contests and the the

904
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,599
practical application i don't know of

905
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,720
any such activities but we do plan to uh

906
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
to run it and probably with positive

907
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,079
technologies

908
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,760
hopefully

909
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
yeah we'll be glad to

910
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,359
yeah i think he'll create something like

911
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,359
hacker one that will

912
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,280
where you will be able to

913
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
uh give someone

914
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,599
a bounty for uh from hacking

915
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
okay no more questions peter i hope

916
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
you'll be here right

917
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,720
and i hope we'll be able to find you

918
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
so

919
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,520
with that right now we say thank you

920
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,920
and we choose two questions i like the

921
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,119
regulation

922
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,040
legislation

923
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
choice

924
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,200
black or white

925
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,280
this is much harder yeah

926
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,040
white

927
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,160
and the black one will go to the person

928
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,800
that sits over there

929
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,599
the first question was great

930
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,400
thank you indeed dear colleagues

931
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,640
thank you

932
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,440
thanks a lot and the next

933
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,280
presentation is at 12 o'clock sharp
